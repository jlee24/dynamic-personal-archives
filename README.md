# Dynamic Personal Archives
**Tool for journalists and storytellers tracking ideas within multimedia archives**

## Overview
See the <a href=engelbart.juhokim.com>demo</a>

1. Converts media into text using automatic speech recognition (specifically <a href=github.com/lowerquality/gentle>Gentle</a>, another project I participated in) for audio/video and OCR for documents

2. Analyzes information with NLP: uses dynamic topic modeling to find high-level themes, TFIDF to identify key points within specific resoources, cosine similarity to find relations across resources

3. Visualizes the archive across a contextual timeline
