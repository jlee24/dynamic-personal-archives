Dear Mr. Engelbart:

This letter is by way of extending a "formal" invitation to you to present a talk at our Computer Seminar. As you know, Ed Herold has a prior commitment for April 13, and, with your approval, I will schedule the talk for April 14 at 11:00 am. 

The seminar is generally informal - attendees include Lab people, Princeton Graduate students, personnel from the RCA divisions (most likely Graphic Systems in this instance), and an occasional visitor from IDA or Forrestal. I will need a title and brieg abstract of your talk for the meeting notices. We will, of course, pay your expenses - the "incremental" ones. If you need any visual aids for the talk, please let me know.

Cordially,

K.R. Kaplan

Dear Mr. Kaplan:

This is to verify our arrangements. I will arrive to Princeton by the evening of Thursday, April 13, and will try to contact Ed Herold, Ken Fischbeck or you by 9 a.m. Friday. Enclosed is the title and abstract that you requested. As for visual aids. I will bring along my own movie projector, and electric power. I won't need a projectionist.

If you have any further questions, I will be at SRI here in Menlo Park for the rest of this week--but I will be traveling beginning Sunday, April 9. I am looking forward to the visit.

Sincerely,

D.C. Engelbart
Program Head
