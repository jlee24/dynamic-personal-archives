The keyset was developed for entering commands with the left hand while using the mouse in the right hand. By pressing down on any key or key combinations you could type all the letters of the alphabet, and more. The mouse and keyset were used in concert for very fast, efficient and accurate user interface. The keyset is easier to learn than a keyboard.
