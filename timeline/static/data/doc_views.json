        "full": "<div>Program On Human Effectiveness</div><br><div>by Douglas C. Engelbart <br>Stanford Research Institute, Computer Techniques Laboratory, Menlo Park, California. <br>December 1961</div><br><div>I. Introduction</div><br><div>Human beings face ever more complex and urgent problems, and their effectiveness in dealing with these problems is a matter that is critical to the stability and continued progress of society. A human is effective not just because he applies to a problem a high degree of native intelligence or physical strength (with a full measure of motivation and purposefulness), but also because he makes use of efficient tools, methods, and strategies. These latter may be directly modified for increased effectiveness. A plan to systematically evolve such modifications has been developed at Stanford Research Institute. The plan is a long-range one and is based on the premise that a strong, coordinated attack is necessary if significant progress is to be made.<br>The possibilities we are pursuing involve an integrated man-machine working relationship, where close, continuous interaction with a computer avails the human of radically changed information-handling and -portrayal skills, and where clever utilization of these skills provides radical changes in the way the human attacks problems. Our aim is to bring significant improvement to the real-life problem-solving effectiveness of individuals. It is felt that such a program competes in social significance with research toward harnessing thermonuclear power, exploring outer space, or conquering cancer, and that the potential payoffs warrant a concerted attack on the principal problem areas.</div><br><div>The basic concept of utilizing technological aids in close cooperation with an individual's detailed problem-solving activities is not new. Indeed, our books, pencils and typewriters attest to a long evolution of the concept. In recent years however, a number of basically new approaches to the problem have been initiated. Several researchers (2-8) have pointed out the gains offered by close integration of modern information-handling equipment with the human problem solver. Many contributions have been made in different disciplinary areas--e.g. human engineering, problem-solvillg and educational psychology, linguistics, computer programming, electronic display systems, computer time sharing, operations research, management science, systems engineering, and industrial engineering--all of which appear to form part of a normal evolutionary development toward increased understanding of man-machine integration problems. Also, a number of efforts (9-13) are under way that bear more directly upon the type of man-computer cooperation envisaged in our program; however, none of these has revealed as basic an approach as that proposed herein. Perhaps the most useful work to guide our early activities is that in artificial intelligence and heuristic programming (14-16), where problem-solving processes and nlethods of approach have been developed for totally man-made systems.</div><br><div>II. Background</div><br><div>For other than intuitional or reflexive actions, an individual thinks and works his way through his problems by manipulating concepts before his mind's eye. His powers of memory and visualization are too limited to let him solve very mally of his problellls by doing this entirely in his mind. For most real-life problems, an individual needs to represent these concepts with numbers, letters, words, graphs, drawings, etc. (i.e., with symbols) that can be assembled and rearranged before his eyes in patterns that portray the conceptual relationships to be considered. We conventionally use marks on paper for thus augmenting our visualization and memory capabilities.<br>Thus, a large part of an individual's meaningful intellectual activity involves the purposeful manipulation of concepts; and of this concept-manipulation activity, a very important part is accomplished by the external manipulation of symbols. A fundamental hypothesis of the proposed approach is that the ability of a given human to control the real-time external manipulation of symbols, in response to the minute-by-minute needs of his thought processes, has a profound effect upon the whole structure of concepts and methods utilized in his intellectual activity. The approach can be succinctly described by saying that our aim is to use the best that technology can offer in providing increased symbol-manipulation power to the human, and then to explore the resulting possibilities for redesigning his structure of concepts and methods in order to make him significantly more effective in solving real-life problems.</div><br><div>For this application, the stereotyped image of the computer as only a mathematical instrument is too limiting--essentially, a computer can manipulate any symbol in any describable way. It is not just mathematical or other formal methods that are being considered.Our aim is to give help in manipulating any of the concepts that the individual usefully symbolizes in his work, of which those of mathematical nature comprise but a limited portion in most real-life instances.</div><br><div>Initially, at least, ours is all engineering approach toward the task of redesigning different parts of a functioning system in order to increase its performance. Our model stems from the picture of the \"neuro-muscular\" human, with his basic sensory, mental, and motor capabilities, and the means employed to match these capabilities to the problems he must face. These means have for the most part been evolved within the culture in which he is born, and he has been training in their use since childhood. We refer here to all of the tricks, tools, techniques, methods, strategies, special skills, etc., that the individual human can bring to bear upon his struggle with his problems. Our initial approach toward making the human more effective is to try to do a coordinated re-vamping of these means of augmenting basic human capabilities.</div><br><div>We have found four useful categories with which to divide these augmentation means:</div><br><div>(1) Language, which includes (a) the way the human's picture of his world is parcelled into tlle concepts that his mind uses to model that world, and (b) the symbols that he attaches to those concepts and with which he represents them when he does his concept manipulation (or \"thinking\").</div><br><div>(2) Artifacts, which we define as (a) the physical things designed to provide for his physical comfort and movements, (b) the tools and equipment that help him manipulate physical objects or materials, and (c) the tools and equipment that help him manipulate symbols (and therefore, concepts, or information).</div><br><div>(3) Methodology, which represents the methods, procedures, strategies, etc., with which he organizes his execution of a process.</div><br><div>(4) Training, which represents the conditioning needed by the human to bring his skills in the utilization of Items (1), (2), and (3) to the point where they are operationally effective.</div><br><div>We then have a functional model of a trained human, with his Language, Artifacts and Methodology, as the problem-solving system whose effectiveness we want to improve. Our aim is to make coordinated improvements upon the Language, Artifacts, and Methodology that he uses, and the Training that he is given.</div><br><div>III. The Plan</div><br><div>A. Objectives</div><br><div>1. Long Range</div><br><div>The long-range objective of this program is to increase significantly the effectiveness of human problem solvers. At any given stage of progress, our aim will be to recognize the controllable factors that limit the individual's particular level of effectiveness, and to develop means for raising that level.<br>We are concerned with an individual's ability to gain comprehension in complex problem situations, to recognize the key factors therein, to develop effective solutions to these problems, and to see that these solutions are successfully implemented. Problem-solving effectiveness is improved if solutions can be found to problems that previously were too \"hard\" to solve at all, or for previously solvable problems if the same solutions could be found in a shorter time, or if a better solution could be found within the same time.</div><br><div>2. Short Range(Two to Three Years)</div><br><div>The immediate objective of this program is to increase the effectiveness of individuals at special problem-solving tasks of our own designation, using the most sophisticated approach we can, and striving for comprehensive and integrated re-design of the individuals' means for working (see Section III B for discussion of these special tasks). We want to use this effort as a calibration of what can be achieved, as an introduction to the variety of difficulties associated with this particular type of an engineering approach to a human-capability problem and as an opportunity to develop sound research methods within a workably limited scope of activity.</div><br><div>B. General Approach</div><br><div>In view of the tremendous worth to society of any new development that could bring significant increase to the effectiveness of its planners, researchers, coordinators, arbitrators, etc., we feel that the approach offering the highest possible research payoff should be taken. This, together with the tremendous rate of development in the information-processing technology (hence the predictable widespread utilization of sophisticated equipment), impel us toward starting right out with the best that technology can offer now in the way of equipment to help the individual manipulate symbols.<br>A test subject will therefore have a digital computer whose capabilities are immediately available to his every call for service. He will communicate with the computer from a working station equipped with personal display and input devices that hopefully need make no compromise in giving him the best useable features that we can buy or develop. These facilities shall be continuously re-evaluated in light of other developments within the program, and it is expected that equipment modifications will be developed and tested as part of the program.</div><br><div>At any given stage of our research, we shall be making a coordinated development of both the special programmed-computer services that the subject can call upon, and the associated special methods for his using these services in manipulating symbols. Different sets of services and methods will be evaluated by measuring the subject's performance while using them on specially selected test tasks, until we have isolated a set of such services and methods that provide him with a significant degree of effectiveness at the given type of test task.</div><br><div>We plan a sequence of tasks, initially involving primitive but essential symbol-manipulation capabilities such as composing and modifying different forms of information portrayal (text, diagrams, etc.). This will lead progressively through developments for intermedi ate capabilities of personal \"bookkeeping,\" composing or modifying computer-service designations (programming), calculating, planning, etc. Upon an integrated base of such human-controlled, machine-aided capabilities, we plan finally to develop the highest-ordered processes that real-world problem solvers can utilize.</div><br><div>The special problem-solving areas to which we first wish to apply our efforts toward increased effectiveness have been selected to satisfy the following criteria:</div><br><div>(a) The areas should involve a limited domain of information, and limited exterllal-world interaction, to keep the system we are studying within a manageable scope.</div><br><div>(b) The areas should involve intellectually challenging problems of the same qualitative character as possessed by our more general real-world problems.</div><br><div>(c) The areas should be such that we can build upon our results if we are successful and decide to tackle a more general problem-solving area in a next stage of pursuit of our main objective. (i.e., the services and methods developed here can be extended to meet the needs of the problem solver of the succeeding stage of our program.)</div><br><div>(d) In general, the areas should be such that success could lead fairly directly to worthwhile real-world applications for bringing increased effectiveness to specialists in critical areas, in parallel with continued research work toward helping the solvers of more general problems.</div><br><div>(e) In particular, the areas should be such that success here could be applied to meaningful parts of our continuing research activity, to make significant increases in the effectiveness with which we do research on human effectiveness.</div><br><div>IV. Personnel and Facilities</div><br><div>It is estimated that eight to ten professional people representing a variety of disciplines will be required for successful pursuit of the objectives of the proposed program. Psychology, computer programming, and computer engineering comprise a set of essential disciplines; in addition, considerable benefit would be derived from personnel backgrounds in such fields as artificial intelligence, systems analysis, display engineering, time-and-motion study, management science, psycho-linguistics, and information retrieval. Since the program will be developing a new conceptual structure involving a number of disci plines, researchers from each discipline will to some extent the expected to adjust to this newly evolving structure and its terminology.<br>The heart of the experimental facilities will be a digital computer capable of working in real time with test subjects. The computer must be highly flexible with respect to the amount of internal high-speed storage and the type and amount of external storage that can be added. In addition, the computer must lend itself readily to time-sharing utilization. The internal structure of the computer must be susceptible to ready modification as must also be the specially developed peripheral equipment with which it must work closely.</div><br><div>Two principal alternatives for realizing such experimental facilities exist. The first involves acquiring a small, fast medium-priced machine especially suited to the needs of this program. The second involves acquiring the basic computational service from a large machine whose use is shared (on a time-shared basis) with other users; in this case, only special-purpose matching and buffering equipment will be required for the particular needs of the program. In either case, the working station(s), with individual input and display provisions, will initially be composed of commercially available equipment but will undergo a fair degree of modification as the desired functional requirements evolve.</div><br><div>V. Development and Application Activity</div><br><div>There will be a progression of special problem-solving areas through which the program moves as we methodically build up the different capabilities which comprise the full and integrated repertoire needed for generalized real-world problem solving. It is planned to guide this progression so that within a few years we can begin to utilize our results in an associated Development and Application activity, where we develop special system designs (equipment, processes, methods, training, etc.) that can be applied practically to the tasks of real-world specialists. A computer programmer seems a natural candidate for the first such development, and cryptographers, information specialists, teaching-machine program composers, etc., can be considered subsequently. This type of activity is expected to provide very valuable feedback to the research work.<br>Ultimately the development work will progress toward even more general types of problem solvers, to lead us toward the researchers, the planners, the leaders, and the doers upon whom our society depends so critically.</div>",

Noe, Director Engineering Science Division</div><br><div>Abstract</div><br><div>This is an initial summary report of a project taking a new and systematic approach to improving the intellectual effectiveness of the individual human being. A detailed conceptual framework explores the nature of the system composed of the individual and the tools, concepts, and methods that match his basic capabilities to his problems. One of the tools that shows the greatest immediate promise is the computer, when it can be harnessed for direct on-line assistance, integrated with new concepts and methods.</div><br><div>Foreword</div><br><div>This report describes a study that was carried on at Stanford Research Institute under the joint sponsorship of the Institute and the Directorate of Information Sciences of the Air Force Office of Scientific Research [Contract AF 49(638)-1024]. Mrs. Rowena Swanson was the AFOSR Project Supervisor for this study.</div><br><div>I . INTRODUCTION</div><br><div>A. GENERAL</div><br><div>By \"augmenting human intellect\" we mean increasing the capability of a man to approach a complex problem situation, to gain comprehension to suit his particular needs, and to derive solutions to problems. Increased capability in this respect is taken to mean a mixture of the following: more-rapid comprehension, better comprehension, the possibility of gaining a useful degree of comprehension in a situation that previously was too complex, speedier solutions, better solutions, and the possibility of finding solutions to problems that before seemed insoluble. And by \"complex situations\" we include the professional problems of diplomats, executives, social scientists, life scientists, physical scientists, attorneys, designers--whether the problem situation exists for twenty minutes or twenty years. We do not speak of isolated clever tricks that help in particular situations. We refer to a way of life in an integrated domain where hunches, cut-and-try, intangibles, and the human \"feel for a situation\" usefully co-exist with powerful concepts, streamlined terminology and notation, sophisticated methods, and high-powered electronic aids.</div><br><div>Man's population and gross product are increasing at a considerable rate, but the complexity of his problems grows still faster, and the urgency with which solutions must be found becomes steadily greater in response to the increased rate of activity and the increasingly global nature of that activity. Augmenting man's intellect, in the sense defined above, would warrant full pursuit by an enlightened society if there could be shown a reasonable approach and some plausible benefits.</div><br><div>This report covers the first phase of a program aimed at developing means to augment the human intellect. These \"means\" can include many things--all of which appear to be but extensions of means developed andused in the past to help man apply his native sensory, mental, and motor capabilities--and we consider the whole system of a human and his augmentation means as a proper field of search for practical possibilities. It is a very important system to our society, and like most systems its performance can best be improved by considering the whole as a set of interacting components rather than by considering the components in isolation.</div><br><div>This kind of system approach to human intellectual effectiveness does not find a ready-made conceptual framework such as exists for established disciplines. Before a research program can be designed to pursue such an approach intelligently, so that practical benefits might be derived within a reasonable time while also producing results of longrange significance, a conceptual framework must be searched out--a framework that provides orientation as to the important factors of the system, the relationships among these factors, the types of change among the system factors that offer likely improvements in performance, and the sort of research goals and methodology that seem promising.1</div><br><div>In the first (search) phase of our program we have developed a conceptual framework that seems satisfactory for the current needs of designing a research phase. Section II contains the essence of this framework as derived from several different ways of looking at the system made up of a human and his intellect-augmentation means.</div><br><div>The process of developing this conceptual framework brought out a number of significant realizations: that the intellectual effectiveness exercised today by a given human has little likelihood of being intelligence limited--that there are dozens of disciplines in engineering, mathematics, and the social, life, and physical sciences that can contribute improvements to the system of intellect-augmentation means; that any one such improvement can be expected to trigger a chain of coordinatingimprovements; that until every one of these disciplines comes to a standstill and we have exhausted all the improvement possibilities we could glean from it, we can expect to continue to develop improvements in this human-intellect system; that there is no particular reason not to expect gains in personal intellectual effectiveness from a concerted systemoriented approach that compare to those made in personal geographic mobility since horseback and sailboat days.</div><br><div>The picture of how one can view the possibilities for a systematic approach to increasing human intellectual effectiveness, as put forth in Section II in the sober and general terms of an initial basic analysis, does not seem to convey all of the richness and promise that was stimulated by the development of that picture. Consequently, Section III is intended to present some definite images that illustrate meaningful possibilities deriveable from the conceptual framework presented in Section II--and in a rather marked deviation from ordinary technical writing, a good portion of Section III presents these images in a fiction-dialogue style as a mechanism for transmitting a feeling for the richness and promise of the possibilities in one region of the improvement space\" that is roughly mapped in Section II.</div><br><div>The style of Section III seems to make for easier reading. If Section II begins to seem unrewardingly difficult, the reader may find it helpful to skip from Section II-B directly to Section III. If it serves its purpose well enough, Section III will provide a context within which the reader can go back and finish Section II with less effort.</div><br><div>In Section IV (Research Recommendations) we present a general strategy for pursuing research toward increasing human intellectual effectiveness. This strategy evolved directly from the concepts presented in Sections II and III; one of its important precepts is to pursue the quickest gains first, and use the increased intellectual effectiveness thus derived to help pursue successive gains. We see the quickest gains emerging from (1) giving the human the minute-by-minute services of a digital computer equipped with computer-driven cathode-ray-tube display, and (2) developing the new methods of thinking and working that allow the human to capitalizeupon the computer's help. By this same strategy, we recommend that an initial research effort develop a prototype system of this sort aimed at increasing human effectiveness in the task of computer programming.</div><br><div>To give the reader an initial orientation about what sort of thing this computer-aided working system might be, we include below a short description of a possible system of this sort. This illustrative example is not to be considered a description of the actual system that will emerge from the program. It is given only to show the general direction of the work, and is clothed in fiction only to make it easier to visualize.</div><br><div>Let us consider an augmented architect at work. He sits at a working station that has a visual display screen some three feet on a side; this is his working surface, and is controlled by a computer (his \"clerk\" ) with which he can communicate by means of a small keyboard and various other devices.</div><br><div>He is designing a building. He has already dreamed up several basic layouts and structural forms, and is trying them out on the screen. The surveying data for the layout he is working on now have already been entered, and he has just coaxed the clerk to show him a perspective view of the steep hillside building site with the roadway above, symbolic representations of the various trees that are to remain on the lot, and the service tie points for the different utilities. The view occupies the left two-thirds of the screen. With a \"pointer,\" he indicates two points of interest, moves his left hand rapidly over the keyboard, and the distance and elevation between the points indicated appear on the right- hand third of the screen.</div><br><div>Now he enters a reference line with his pointer, and the keyboard. Gradually the screen begins to show the work he is doing--a neat excavation appears in the hillside) revises itself slightly, and revises itself again. After a moment, the architect changes the scene on the screen to an overhead plan view of the site, still showing the excavation. A few minutes of study, and he enters on the keyboard a list of items, checking each one as it appears on the screen, to be studied later.</div><br><div>Ignoring the representation on the display, the architect next begins to enter a series of specifications and data--a six-inch slab floor, twelve-inch concrete walls eight feet high within the excavation, and so on. When he has finished, the revised scene appears on the screen. A structure is taking shape. He examines it, adjusts it, pauses long enough to ask for handbook or catalog information from the clerk at various points, and readjusts accordingly. He often recalls from the \"clerk\" his working lists of specifications and considerations to refer to them, modify them, or add to them. These lists grow into an evermore-detailed, interlinked structure, which represents the maturing thought behind the actual design.</div><br><div>Prescribing different planes here and there, curved surfaces occasionally, and moving the whole structure about five feet, he finally has the rough external form of the building balanced nicely with the setting and he is assured that this form is basically compatible with the materials to be used as well as with the function of the building.</div><br><div>Now he begins to enter detailed information about the interior. Here the capability of the clerk to show him any view he wants to examine (a slice of the interior, or how the structure would look from the roadway above) is important. He enters particular fixture designs, and examines them in a particular room. He checks to make sure that sun glare from the windows will not blind a driver on the roadway, and the \"clerk\" computes the information that one window will reflect strongly onto the roadway between 6 and 6:30 on midsummer mornings.</div><br><div>Next he begins a functional analysis. He has a list of the people who will occupy this building, and the daily sequences of their activtites. The \"clerk\" allows him to follow each in turn, examining how doors swing, where special lighting might be needed. Finally he has the \"clerk\" combine all of these sequences of activity to indicate spots where traffic is heavy in the building, or where congestion might occur, and to determine what the severest drain on the utilities is likely to be.</div><br><div>All of this information (the building design and its associated \"thought structure\") can be stored on a tape to represent the design manual for the building. Loading this tape into his own clerk, another architect, a builder, or the client can maneuver within this design manual to pursue whatever details or insights are of interest to him--and can append special notes that are integrated into the design manual for his own or someone else's later benefit.</div><br><div>In such a future working relationship between human problem-solver and computer 'clerk,' the capability of the computer for executing mathematical processes would be used whenever it was needed. However, the computer has many other capabilities for manipulating and displaying information that can be of significant benefit to the human in nonmathematical processes of planning, organizing, studying, etc. Every person who does his thinking with symbolized concepts (whether in the form of the English language, pictographs, formal logic, or mathematics) should be able to benefit significantly.</div><br><div>B. OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</div><br><div>The objective of this study is to develop a conceptual framework within which could grow a coordinated research and development program whose goals would be the following: (1) to find the factors that limit the effectiveness of the individual's basic information-handling capabilities in meeting the various needs of society for problem solving in its most general sense; and (2) to develop new techniques, procedures, and systems that will better match these basic capabilities to the needs' problems, and progress of society. We have placed the following specifications on this framework:</div><br><div>1. That it provide perspective for both long-range basic research and research that will yield practical results soon.<br>2. That it indicate what this augmentation will actually involve in the way of changes in working environment, in thinking, in skills, and in methods of working.<br>3. That it be a basis for evaluating the possible relevance of work and knowledge from existing fields and for assimilating whatever is relevant.<br>4. That it reveal areas where research is possible and ways to assess the research, be a basis for choosing starting points, and indicate how to develop appropriate methodologies for the needed research.</div><br><div>Two points need emphasis here. First, although a conceptual framework has been constructed, it is still rudimentary. Further search, and actual research, are needed for the evolution of the framework. Second, even if our conceptual framework did provide an accurate and complete basic analysis of the system from which stems a human's intellectual effectiveness, the explicit nature of future improved systems would be highly affected by (expected) changes in our technology or in our understanding of the human being.</div><br><div>II. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK</div><br><div>A. GENERAL</div><br><div>The conceptual framework we seek must orient us toward the real possibilities and problems associated with using modern technology to give direct aid to an individual in comprehending complex situations, isolating the significant factors, and solving problems. To gain this orientation, we examine how individuals achieve their present level of effectiveness, and expect that this examination will reveal possibilities for improvement.</div><br><div>The entire effect of an individual on the world stems essentially from what he can transmit to the world through his limited motor channels. This in turn is based on information received from the outside world through limited sensory channels; on information, drives, and needs generated within him; and on his processing of that information. His processing is of two kinds: that which he is generally conscious of (recognizing patterns, remembering, visualizing, abstracting, deducing, inducing, etc.), and that involving the unconscious processing and mediating of received and self-generated information, and the unconscious mediating of conscious processing itself.</div><br><div>The individual does not use this information and this processing to grapple directly with the sort of complex situation in which we seek to give him help. He uses his innate capabilities in a rather more indirect fashion, since the situation is generally too complex to yield directly to his motor actions, and always too complex to yield comprehensions and solutions from direct sensory inspection and use of basic cognitive capabilities. For instance, an aborigine who possesses all of our basic sensory-mental-motor capabilities, but does not possess our background of indirect knowledge and procedure, cannot organize the proper direct actions necessary to drive a car through traffic, request a book from the library, call a committee meeting to discuss a tentative plan, call someone on the telephone, or compose a letter on the typewriter.</div><br><div>Our culture has evolved means for us to organize the little things we can do with our basic capabilities so that we can derive comprehension from truly complex situations, and accomplish the processes of deriving and implementing problem solutions. The ways in which human capabilities are thus extended are here called augmentation means, and we define four basic classes of them:</div><br><div>1. Artifacts--physical objects designed to provide for human comfort, for the manipulation of things or materials, and for the manipulation of symbols.<br>2. Language--the way in which the individual parcels out the picture of his world into the concepts that his mind uses to model that world, and the symbols that he attaches to those concepts and uses in consciously manipulating the concepts (\"thinking\").<br>3. Methodology--the methods, procedures, strategies, etc., with which an individual organizes his goal-centered (problem-solving) activity.<br>4. Training--the conditioning needed by the human being to bring his skills in using Means 1, 2, and 3 to the point where they are operationally effective.</div><br><div>The system we want to improve can thus be visualized as a trained human being together with his artifacts, language, and methodology. The explicit new system we contemplate will involve as artifacts computers, and computer-controlled information-storage, information-handling, and information-display devices. The aspects of the conceptual framework that are discussed here are primarily those relating to the human being's ability to make significant use of such equipment in an integrated system.</div><br><div>Pervading all of the augmentation means is a particular structure or organization. While an untrained aborigine cannot drive a car through traffic, because he cannot leap the gap between his cultural background and the kind of world that contains cars and traffic, it is possible to move step by step through an organized training program that will enable him to drive effectively and safely. In other words, the human mind neither learns nor acts by large leaps, but by steps organized or structured so that each one depends upon previous steps.</div><br><div>Although the size of the step a human being can take in comprehension, innovation, or execution is small in comparison to the over-all size of the step needed to solve a complex problem, human beings nevertheless do solve complex problems. It is the augmentation means that serve to break down a large problem in such a way that the human being can walk through it with his little steps, and it is the structure or organization of these little steps or actions that we discuss as process hierarchies.</div><br><div>Every process of thought or action is made up of sub-processes. Let us consider such examples as making a pencil stroke, writing a letter of the alphabet, or making a plan. Quite a few discrete muscle movements are organized into the making of a pencil stroke; similarly, making particular pencil strokes and making a plan for a letter are complex processes in themselves that become sub-processes to the over-all writing of an alphabetic character.</div><br><div>Although every sub-process is a process in its own right, in that it consists of further sub-processes, there seems to be no point here in looking for the ultimate bottom of the process-hierarchical structure. There seems to be no way of telling whether or not the apparent bottoms (processes that cannot be further subdivided) exist in the physical world or in the limitations of human understanding.</div><br><div>In any case, it is not necessary to begin from the bottom in discussing particular process hierarchies. No person uses a process that is completely unique every time he tackles something new. Instead, he begins from a group of basic sensory-mental-motor process capabilities, and adds to these certain of the process capabilities of his artifacts. There are only a finite number of such basic human and artifact capabilities from which to draw. Furthermore, even quite different higher order processes may have in common relatively high-order sub-processes\".</div><br><div>When a man writes prose text (a reasonably high-order process), he makes use of many processes as sub-processes that are common to other high-order processes. For example, he makes use of planning, composing, dictating. The process of writing is utilized as a sub-process within many different processes of a still higher order, such as organizing a committee, changing a policy, and so on.</div><br><div>What happens, then, is that each individual develops a certain repertoire of process capabilities from which he selects and adapts those that will compose the processes that he executes. This repertoire is like a tool kit, and just as the mechanic must know what his tools can do and how to use them, so the intellectual worker must know the capabilities of his tools and have good methods, strategies, and rules of thumb for making use of them. All of the process capabilities in the individual's repertoire rest ultimately upon basic capabilities within him or his artifacts, and the entire repertoire represents an inter-knit, hierarchical structure (which we often call the repertoire hierarchy).</div><br><div>We find three general categories of process capabilities within a typical individual's repertoire. There are those that are executed completely within the human integument, which we call explicit-human process capabilities; there are those possessed by artifacts for executing processes without human intervention, which we call explicit-artifact process capabilities; and there are what we call the composite process capabilities, which are derived from hierarchies containing both of the other kinds.</div><br><div>We assume that it is our H-LAM/T system (Human using Lauguage, Artifacts, Methodology, in which he is Trained) that has the capability and that performs the process in any instance of use of this repertoire. Let us look within the process structure for the LAM/T ingredients, to get a better \"feel\" for our models. Consider the process of writing an important memo.There is a particular concept associated with this process -- that of putting information into a formal package and distributing it to a set of people for a certain kind of consideration -- and the type of information package associated with this concept has been given the special name of memorandum. Already the system language shows the effect of this process--i.e., a concept and its name.</div><br><div>The memo-writing process may be executed by using a set of process capabilities (in intermixed or repetitive form) such as the following planning, developing subject matter, composing text, producing hard copy, and distributing. There is a definite way in which these sub-processes will be organized that represents part of the system methodology. Each of these sub-processes represents a functional concept that must be a part of the system language if it is to be organized effectively into the human's way of doing things, and the symbolic portrayal of each concept must be such that the human can work with it and remember it.</div><br><div>If the memo is simple, a paragraph or so in length, then the first three processes may well be of the explicit-human type (i.e., it may be planned, developed) and composed within the mind) and the last two of the composite type. If it is a complex memo, involving a good deal of careful planning and development, then all of the sub-processes might well be of the composite type (e.g., at least including the use of pencil and paper artifacts)' and there might be many different applications of some of the process capabilities within the total process (i.e., successive drafts, revised plans).</div><br><div>The set of sub-process capabilities discussed so far, if called upon in proper occasion and sequence, would indeed enable the execution of the memo-writing process. However, the very process of organizing and supervising the utilization of these sub-process capabilities is itself a most important sub-process of the memo-writing process. Hence, the sub- process capabilities as listed would not be complete without the addition of a seventh capability--what we call the executive capability. This is the capability stemming from habit, strategy, rules of thumb, prejudice, learned method, intuition, unconscious dictates, or combinations thereof, to call upon the appropriate sub-process capabilities with a particular sequence and timing. An executive process (i.e., the exercise of an executive capability) involves such sub-processes as planning, selecting, and supervising, and it is really the executive processes that embody all of the methodology in the H-LAM/T system.</div><br><div>To illustrate the capability-hierarchy features of our conceptual framework, let us consider an artifact innovation appearing directly within the relatively low-order capability for composing and modifying written text, and see how this can affect a (or, for instance, your) hierarchy of capabilities. Suppose you had a new writing machine--think of it as a high-speed electric typewriter with some special features. You could operate its keyboard to cause it to write text much as you could use a conventional typewriter. But the printing mechanism is more complicated; besides printing a visible character at every stroke, it adds special encoding features by means of invisible selective components in the ink and special shaping of the character.</div><br><div>As an auxiliary device, there is a gadget that is held like a pencil and, instead of a point, has a special sensing mechanism that you can pass over a line of the special printing from your writing machine (or one like it). The signals which this reading stylus sends through the flexible connecting wire to the writing machine are used to determine which characters are being sensed and thus to cause the automatic typing of a duplicate string of characters. An information-storage mechanism in the writing machine permits you to sweep the reading stylus over the characters much faster than the writer can type; the writer will catch up with you when you stop to think about what word or string of words should be duplicated next, or while you reposition the straightedge guide along which you run the stylus.</div><br><div>This writing machine would permit you to use a new process of composing text. For instance, trial drafts could rapidly be composed from re-arranged excerpts of old drafts, together with new words or passages which you stop to type in. Your first draft could represent a free outpouring of thoughts in any order, with the inspection of foregoing thoughts continuously stimulating new considerations and ideas to be entered. If the tangle of thoughts represented by the draft became too complex, you would compile a reordered draft quickly. It would be practical for you to accommodate more complexity in the trails of thought you might build in search of the path that suits your needs.</div><br><div>You can integrate your new ideas more easily, and thus harness your creativity more continuously, if you can quickly and flexibly change your working record. If it is easier to update any part of your working record to accommodate new developments in thought or circumstance, you will find it easier to incorporate more complex procedures in your way of doing things. This will probably allow you to accommodate the extra burden associated with, for instance, keeping and using special files whose contents are both contributed to and utilized by any current work in a flexible manner--which in turn enables you to devise and use even-more complex procedures to better harness your talents in your particular working situation.</div><br><div>The important thing to appreciate here is that a direct new innovation in one particular capability can have far-reaching effects throughout the rest of your capability hierarchy. A change can propagate up through the capability hierarchy; higher-order capabilities that can utilize the initially changed capability can now reorganize to take special advantage of this change and of the intermediate higher-capability changes. A change can propagate down through the hierarchy as a result of new capabilities at the high level and modification possibilities latent in lower levels. These latent capabilities may previously have been unusable in the hierarchy and become usable because of the new capability at the higher level.</div><br><div>The writing machine and its flexible copying capability would occupy you for a long time if you tried to exhaust the reverberating chain of associated possibilities for making useful innovations within your capability hierarchy. This one innovation could trigger a rather extensive redesign of this hierarchy; your way of accomplishing many of your tasks would change considerably. Indeed this process characterizes the sort of evolution that our intellect-augmentation means have been undergoing since the first human brain appeared.</div><br><div>To our objective of deriving orientation about possibilities for actively pursuing an increase in human intellectual effectiveness, it is important to realize that we must be prepared to pursue such new- possibility chains throughout the entire capability hierarchy (calling for a system approach). It is also important to realize that we must be oriented to the synthesis of new capabilities from reorganization of other capabilities, both old and new, that exist throughout the hierarchy (calling for a \"system-engineering\" approach).</div><br><div>B. THE BASIC PERSPECTIVE</div><br><div>Individuals who operate effectively in our culture have already been considerably \"augmented.\" Basic human capabilities for sensing stimuli, performing numerous mental operations, and for communicating with the outside world, are put to work in our society within a system--an H-LAM/T system--the individual augmented by the language, artifacts, and methodology in which he is trained. Furthermore, we suspect that improving the effectiveness of the individual as he operates in our society should be approached as a system-engineering problem--that is, the H-LAM/T system should be studied as an interacting whole from a synthesis-oriented approach.</div><br><div>This view of the system as an interacting whole is strongly bolstered by considering the repertoire hierarchy of process capabilities that is structured from the basic ingredients within the H-LAM/T system. The realization that any potential change in language, artifact, or methodology has importance only relative to its use within a process' and that a new process capability appearing anywhere within that hierarchy can make practical a new consideration of latent change possibilities in many other parts of the hierarchy--possibilities in either language, artifacts, or methodology--brings out the strong interrelationship of these three augmentation means.</div><br><div>Increasing the effectiveness of the individual's use of his basic capabilities is a problem in redesigning the changeable parts of a system. The system is actively engaged in the continuous processes (among others) of developing comprehension within the individual and of solving problems; both processes are subject to human motivation, purpose, and will. To redesign the system's capability for performing these processes means redesigning all or part of the repertoire hierarchy. To redesign a structure, we must learn as much as we can of what is known about the basic materials and components as they are utilized within the structure; beyond that, we must learn how to view, to measure, to analyze, and to evaluate in terms of the functional whole and its purpose. In this particular case, no existing analytic theory is by itself adequate for the purpose of analyzing and evaluating over-all system performance; pursuit of an improved system thus demands the use of experimental methods.</div><br><div>It need not be just the very sophisticated or formal process capabilities that are added or modified in this redesign. Essentially any of the processes utilized by a representative human today--the processes that he thinks of when he looks ahead to his day's work--are composite processes of the sort that involve external composing and manipulating of symbols (text, sketches, diagrams, lists, etc.). Many of the external composing and manipulating (modifying, rearranging) processes serve such characteristically \"human\" activities as playing with forms and relationships to ask what develops, cut- and-try multiple-pass development of an idea, or listing items to reflect on and then rearranging and extending them as thoughts develop.</div><br><div>Existing, or near-future, technology could certainly provide our professional problem-solvers with the artifacts they need to have for duplicating and rearranging text before their eyes, quickly and with a minimum of human effort. Even ao apparently minor an advance could yield total changes in an individual's repertoire hierarchy that would represent a great increase in over-all effectivenesa. Normally the necessary equipment would enter the market slowly; changes from the expected would be small, people would change their ways of doing things a little at a time, and only gradually would their accumulated changes create markets for more radical versions of the equipment. Such an evolutionary process has been typical of the way our repertoire hierarchies have grown and formed.</div><br><div>But an active research effort, aimed at exploring and evaluating poasible integrated changes throughout the repertoire hierarchy, could greatly accelerate this evolutionary process. The reaearch effort could guide the product development of new artifacts toward taking long-range meaningful steps; simultaneously competitively minded individuals who would respond to demonstrated methods for achieving greater personal effectiveness would create a market for the more radical equipment innovations. The guided evolutionary process could be expected to be considerably more rapid than the traditional one.</div><br><div>The category of \"more radical innovations\" includes the digital computer as a tool for the personal use of an individual. Here there is not only promise of great flexibility in the composing and rearranging of text and diagrams before the individual's eyes but also promise of many other process capabilities that can be integrated into the H-LAM/T system's repertoire hierarchy.</div><br><div>C. DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE H-LAM/T SYSTEM</div><br><div>1. The Source of Intelligence</div><br><div>When one looks at a computer system that is doing a very complex job, he sees on the surface a machine that can execute some extremely sophisticated processes. If he is a layman, his concept of what provides this sophisticated capability may endow the machine with a mysterious power to sweep information through perceptive and intelligent synthetic thinking devices. Actually, this sophisticated capability results from a very clever organizational hierarchy so that pursuit of the source of intelligence within this system would take one down through layers of functional and physical organization that become successively more primitive.</div><br><div>To be more specific, we can begin at the top and list the major levels down through which we would pass if we successively decomposed the functional elements of each level in search of the \"source of intelligence.\" A programmer could take us down through perhaps three levels (depending upon the sophistication of the total process being executed by the computer) perhaps depicting the organization at each level with a flow chart. The first level down would organize functions corresponding to statements in a problem-oriented language (e.g., ALGOL or COBOL), to achieve the desired over-all process. The second level down would organize lesser functions into the processes represented by first-level statements. The third level would perhaps show how the basic machine commands (or rather the processes which they represent) were organized to achieve each of the functions of the second level.</div><br><div>Then a machine designer could take over, and with a block diagram of the computer's organization he could show us (Level 4) how the different hardware units (e.g., random-access storage, arithmetic registers, adder, arithmetic control) are organized to provide the capability of executing sequences of the commands used in Level 3. The logic designer could then give us a tour of Level 5, also using block diagrams, to show us how such hardware elements as pulse gates, flip-flops' and AND, OR, and NOT circuits can be organized into networks giving the functions utilized at Level 4. For Level 6 a circuit engineer could show us diagrams revealing how components such as transistors, resistors, capacitors, and diodes can be organized into modular networks that provide the functions needed for the elements of Level 5.</div><br><div>Device engineers and physicists of different kinds could take us down through more layers. But rather soon we have crossed the boundary between what is man-organized and what is nature-organized, and are ultimately discussing the way in which a given physical phenomenon is derived from the intrinsic organization of sub-atomic particles, with our ability to explain succeeding layers blocked by the exhaustion of our present human comprehension.</div><br><div>If we then ask ourselves where that intelligence is embodied, we are forced to concede that it is elusively distributed throughout a hierarchy of functional processes--a hierarchy whose foundation extends down into natural processes below the depth of our comprehension. If there is any one thing upon which this 'intelligence depends' it would seem to be organization. The biologists and physiologists use a term \"synergism\" to designate (from Webster's Unabridged Dictionary, Second Edition) the \"...cooperative action of discrete agencies such that the total effect is greater than the sum of the two effects taken independently...\" This term seems directly applicable here, where we could say that synergism is our most likely candidate for representing the actual source of intelligence</div><br><div>Actually, each of the social, life, or physical phenomena we observe about us would seem to derive from a supporting hierarchy of organized functions (or processes), in which the synergistic principle gives increased phenomenological sophistication to each succeedingly higher level of organization. In particular, the intelligence of a human being, derived ultimately from the characteristics of individual nerve cells, undoubtedly results from synergism.</div><br><div>2. Intelligence Amplification</div><br><div>It has been jokingly suggested several times during the course of this study that what we are seeking is an \"intelligence amplifier.\" (The term is attributed originally to W. Ross Ashby (2,3). At first this term was rejected on the grounds that in our view one's only hope was to make a better match between existing human intelligence and the problems to be tackled, rather than in making man more intelligent. But deriving the concepts brought out in the preceding section has shown us that indeed this term does seem applicable to our objective.</div><br><div>Accepting the term \"intelligence amplification\" does not imply any attempt to increase native human intelligence. The term \"intelligence amplification\" seems applicable to our goal of augmenting the human intellect in that the entity to be produced will exhibit more of what can be called intelligence than an unaided human could; we will have amplified the intelligence of the human by organizing his intellectual capabilities into higher levels of synergistic structuring. What possesses the amplified intelligence is the resulting H-LAM/T system, in which the LAM/T augmentation means represent the amplifier of the human's intelligence.</div><br><div>In amplifying our intelligence, we are applying the principle of synergistic structuring that was followed by natural evolution in developing the basic human capabilities. What we have done in the development of our augmentation means is to construct a superstructure that is a synthetic extension of the natural structure upon which it is built. In a very real sense, as represented by the steady evolution of our augmentation means, the development of \"artificial intelligence\" has been going on for centuries.</div><br><div>3. Two-Domain System</div><br><div>The human and the artifacts are the only physical components in the H-LAM/T system. It is upon their capabilities that the ultimate capability of the system will depend. This was implied in the earlier statement that every composite process of the system decomposes ultimately into explicit-human and explicit-artifact processes. There are thus two separate domains of activity within the H-LAM/T system: that represented by the human, in which all explicit-human processes occur; and that represented by the artifacts, in which all explicit-artifact processes occur. In any composite process, there is cooperative interaction between the two domains, requiring interchange of energy (much of it for information exchange purposes only). Figure 1 depicts this two domain concept and embodies other concepts discussed below.</div><br><div>Fig.1: The Two Sides of the H-LAM/T System</div><br><div>Where a complex machine represents the principal artifact with which a human being cooperates, the term \"man-machine interface\" has been used for some years to represent the boundary across which energy is exchanged between the two domains. However, the \"man-artifact interface\" has existed for centuries, ever since humans began using artifacts and executing composite processes.</div><br><div>Exchange across this \"interface\" occurs when an explicit-human process is coupled to an explicit-artifact process. Quite often these coupled processes are designed for just this exchange purpose, to provide a functional match between other explicit-human and explicit-artifact processes buried within their respective domains that do the more significant things. For instance, the finger and hand motions (explicit human processes) activate key-linkage motions in the typewriter (couple to explicit-artifact processes). But these are only part of the matching processes between the deeper human processes that direct a given word to be typed and the deeper artifact processes that actually imprint the ink marks on the paper.</div><br><div>The outside world interacts with our H-LAM/T system by the exchange of energy with either the individual or his artifact. Again, special processes are often designed to accommodate this exchange. However, the direct concern of our present study lies within the system, with the internal processes that are and can be significantly involved in the effectiveness of the system in developing the human's comprehension and pursuing the human's goals.</div><br><div>4. Concepts, Symbols, and a Hypothesis</div><br><div>Before we pursue further direct discussion of the H-LAM/T system, let us examine some background material. Consider the following historical progression in the development of our intellectual capabilities:</div><br><div>1. Concept Manipulation--Humans rose above the lower forms of life by evolving the biological capability for developing abstractions and concepts. They could manipulate these concepts within their minds to a certain extent, and think about situations in the abstract. Their mental capabilities allowed them to develop general concepts from specific instances, predict specific instances from general concepts, associate concepts, remember them, etc. We speak here of concepts in their raw, unverbalized form. For example, a person letting a door swing shut behind him suddenly visualizes the person who follows him carrying a cup of hot coffee and some sticky pastries. Of all the aspects of the pending event, the spilling of the coffee and the squashing of the pastry somehow are abstracted immediately, and associated with a concept of personal responsibility and a dislike for these consequences. But a solution comes to mind immediately as an image of a quick stop and an arm stab back toward the door, with motion and timing that could prevent the collision, and the solution is accepted and enacted. With only non-symbolic concept manipulation, we could probably build primitive shelter, evolve strategies of war and hunt, play games, and make practical jokes. But further powers of intellectual effectiveness are implicit in this stage of biological evolution (the same stage we are in today).<br>2. Symbol Manipulation--Humans made another great step forward when they learned to represent particular concepts in their minds with specific symbols. Here we temporarily disregard communicative speech and writing, and consider only the direct value to the individual of being able to do his heavy thinking by mentally manipulating symbols instead of the more unwieldly concepts which they represent. Consider, for instance, the mental difficulty involved in herding twenty- seven sheep if, instead of remembering one cardinal number and occasionally counting, we had to remember what each sheep looked like, so that if the flock seemed too small we could visualize each one and check whether or not it was there.<br>3. Manual, External, Symbol Manipulation--Another significant step toward harnessing the biologically evolved mental capabilities in pursuit of comprehension and problem solutions came with the development of the means for externalizing some of the symbol-manipulation activity, particularly in graphical representation. This supplemented the individual's memory and ability to visualize. (We are not concerned here with the value derived from human cooperation made possible by speech and writing, both forms of external symbol manipulation. We speak of the manual means of making graphical representations of symbols--a stick and sand, pencil and paper and eraser, straight edge or compass, and so on.) It is principally this kind of means for external symbol manipulation that has been associated with the evolution of the individual's present way of doing his concept manipulation (thinking).</div><br><div>It is undoubtedly true that concepts which people found useful ended up being symbolized in their language, and hence that the evolution of language was affected by the concepts the people developed and used. However, Korzybski (4) and Whorf (5) (among others) have argued that the language we use affects our thinking to a considerable extent. They say that a lack of words for some types of concepts makes it hard to express those concepts, and thus decreases the likelihood that we will learn much about them. If this is so, then once a language has begun to grow and be used, it would seem reasonable to suspect that the language also affects the evolution of the new concepts to be expressed in that language.</div><br><div>Apparently there are counter-arguments to this; e.g., if a concept needs to be used often but its expression is difficult, then the language will evolve to ease the situation. However, the studies of the past decade into what are called \"self-organizing\" systems seem to be revealing that subtle relationships among its interacting elements can significantly influence the course of evolution of such a system. If this is true, and if language is (as it seems to be) a part of a selforganizing system, then it seems probable that the state of a language at a given time strongly affects its own evolution to a succeeding state.</div><br><div>For our conceptual framework, we tend to favor the view that a language does exert a force in its own evolution. We observe that the shift over the last few centuries in matters that are of daily concern to the individual has necessarily been forced into the framework of the language existing at the time, with alterations generally limited to new uses for old words, or the coining of new words. The English language since Shakespeare has undergone no alteration comparable to the alteration in the cultural environment; if it had, Shakespeare would no longer be accessible to us. Under such evolutionary conditions, it would seem unlikely that the language we now use provides the best possible service to our minds in pursuing comprehension and solving problems. It seems very likely that a more useful language form can be devised.</div><br><div>The Whorfian hypothesis states that the world view of a culture is limited by the structure of the language which that culture uses. But there seems to be another factor to consider in the evolution of language and human reasoning ability. We offer the following hypothesis, which is related to the Whorfian hypothesis: Both the language used by a culture, and the capability for effective intellectual activity are directly affected during their evolution by the means by which individuals control the external manipulation of symbols. (For identification, we will refer to this as the Neo-Whorfian hypothesis.)</div><br><div>If the Neo-Whorfian hypothesis could be proved readily, and if we could see how our means of externally manipulating symbols influence both our language and our way of thinking, then we would have a valuable instrument for studying human-augmentation possibilities. For the sake of discussion, let us assume the Neo-Whorfian hypothesis to be true, and see what relevant deductions can be made.</div><br><div>If the means evolved for an individual's external manipulation of his thinking-aid symbols indeed directly affect the way in which he thinks, then the original Whorfian hypothesis would offer an added effect. The direct effect of the external-symbol-manipulation means upon language would produce an indirect effect upon the way of thinking via the Whorfian-hypothesis linkage. There would then be two ways for the manner in which our external symbol manipulation was done to affect our thinking.</div><br><div>One way of viewing the H-LAM/T system changes that we contemplate--specifically, integrating the capabilities of a digital computer into the intellectual activity of individual humans--is that we are introducing new and extremely advanced means for externally manipulating symbols. We then want to determine the useful modifications in the language and in the way of thinking that could result. This suggests a fourth stage to the evolution of our individual-human intellectual capability:</div><br><div>4. Automated external symbol manipulation--In this stage, symbols with which the human represents the concepts he is manipulating can be arranged before his eyes, moved, stored, recalled, operated upon according to extremely complex rules--all in very rapid response to a minimum amount of information supplied by the human, by means of special cooperative technological devices. In the limit of what we might now imagine, this could be a computer, with which we could communicate rapidly and easily, coupled to a three-dimensional color display within which it could construct extremely sophisticated images--with the computer being able to execute a wide variety of processes upon parts or all of these images in automatic response to human direction. The displays and processes could provide helpful services--we could imagine both simple and exotic varieties--and could involve concepts that we have never yet imagined (as the pregraphic thinker of Stage 2 would be unable to predict the bar graph, the process of long division, or a card file system).</div><br><div>These hypotheses imply great richness in the new evolutionary spaces opened by progressing from Stage 3 to Stage 4. We would like to study the hypotheses further, examining their possible manifestations in our experience, ways of demonstrating their validity, and possible deductions relative to going to Stage 4.</div><br><div>In search of some simple ways to determine what the Neo-Whorfian hypothesis might imply, we could imagine some relatively straightforward means of increasing our external symbol-manipulation capability and try to picture the consequent changes that could evolve in our language and methods of thinking. Actually, it turned out to be simpler to invert the problem and consider a change that would reduce our capability for external symbol manipulation. This allowed an empirical approach which proved both simple and effective. We thus performed the following experiment.</div><br><div>Brains of power equal to ours could have evolved in an environment where the combination of artifact materials and muscle strengths were so scaled that the neatest scribing tool (equivalent to a pencil, possible had a shape and mass as manageable as a brick would be to us-assuming that our muscles were not specially conditioned to deal with it. We fastened a pencil to a brick and experimented. Figure 2 shows the results, compared with typewriting and ordinary pencil writing. With the brick pencil, we are slower and less precise. If we want to hurry the writing, we have to make it larger. Also, writing the passage twice with the brick-pencil tires the untrained hand and arm.</div><br><div>How would our civilization have matured if this had been the only manual means for us to use in graphical manipulation of symbols? For one thing, the record keeping that enables the organization of commerce and government would probably have taken a form so different from what we know that our social structure would undoubtedly have evolved differently. Also, the effort in doing calculations and writing down extensive and carefully reasoned argument would dampen individualexperimentation with sophisticated new concepts, to lower the rate of learning and the rate of useful output, and perhaps to discourage a good many people from even working at extending understanding. The concepts that would evolve within our culture would thus be different, and very likely the symbology to represent them would be different--much more economical of motion in their writing It thus seems very likely that our thoughts and our language would be rather directly affected by the particular means used by our culture for externally manipulating symbols, which gives little intuitive substantiation to our Neo-Whorfian hypothesis.</div><br><div>Fig. 2: Experimental Results of Tying a Brick to a Pencil to \"De-Augment\" the Individual</div><br><div>To reflect further upon the implications of this hypothesis, the following hypothetical artifact development can be considered, representing a diiferent type of external symbol manipulation that could have had considerable effect. Suppose that our young technology of a few generations ago had developed an artifact that was essentially a high speed, semi-automatic table-lookup device--cheap enough for almost everyone to afford and small and light enough to be carried on the person. Assume that the individual cartridges sold by manufacturers (publishers) contained the look-up information, that one cartridge could hold the equivalent of an unabridged dictionary, and that a one-paragraph definition could always be located and displayed on the face of the device by the average practised individual in less than three seconds. The fortunes of technological invention, commercial interest, and public acceptance just might have evolved something like this.</div><br><div>If it were so very easy to look things up, how would our vocabulary develop, how would our habits of exploring the intellectual domains of others shift, how might the sophistication of practical organization mature (if each person can so quickly and easily look up applicable rules), how would our education system change to take advantage of this new external symbol-manipulation capability of students and teachers (and administrators)?</div><br><div>The significance to our study of the discussion in this section lies in the perspective it gives to the ways in which human intellectual effectiveness can be affected by the particular means used by individuals for their external symbol manipulation. It seems reasonable to consider the development of automated external symbol manipulation means as a next stage in the evolution of our intellectual power.</div><br><div>5. Capability Repertoire Hierarchy</div><br><div>The concept of our H-LAM/T system possessing a repertoire of capabilities that is structured in the form of a hierarchy is most useful in our study. We shall use it in the following to tie together a number of considerations and concepts. There are two points of focus in considering the design of new repertoire hierarchies: the materials with which we have to work, and the principles by which new capability is constructed from these basic materials.</div><br><div>a. Basic Capabilities</div><br><div>\"Materials\" in this context are those capabilities in the human and in the artifact domains from which all other capabilities in the repertoire hierarchy must be constructed. Each such basic capability represents a type of functional component with which the system can be built, and a thorough job of redesigning the system calls for making an inventory of the basic capabilities available. Because we are exploring for perspective, and not yet recommending research activities, we are free to discuss and define in more detail what we mean by \"basic capability\", without regard to the amount of research involved in making an actual inventory.</div><br><div>The two domains, human and artifact, can be explored separately for their basic capabilities, In each we can isolate two classes of basic capability; these classes are distinguished according to whether or not the capability has been put to use within out augmentation means. The first class (those in use) can be found in a methodical manner by analyzing present capability hierarchies. For example, select a given capability, at any level in the hierarchy, and ask yourself if it can be usefully changed by any means that can be given consideration in the augmentation research contemplated, If it can, then it is not basic but it can be decomposed into an eventual set of basic capabilities. As you proceed down through the hierarchy, you will begin to encounter capabilities that cannot be usefully changed, and these will make up your inventory of basic capabilities. Ultimately, every such recursive decomposition of a given capability in the hierarchy will find every one of its branching paths terminated by basic capabilities. Beginning such decomposition search with different capabilities in the hierarchy will eventually uncover all of those basic capabilities used within that hierarchy or augmentation system. Many of the branching paths in the decomposition of a given higher-order capability will terminate in the same basic capability, since a given basic capability will often be used within many different higher-order capabilities.</div><br><div>Determining the class of basic capabilities not already utilized within existing augmentation systems requires a different exploration method. Examples of this method occur in technological research, where analytically oriented researchers search for new understandings of phenomena that can add to the research engineer's list of things to be used in the synthesis of better artifacts.</div><br><div>Before this inventorying task can be pursued in any specific instance, some criteria must be established as to what possible changes within the H-LAM/T system can be given serious consideration. For instance, some research situations might have to disallow changes which require extensive retraining, or which require undignified behavior by the human. Other situations might admit changes requiring years of special training, very expensive equipment, or the use of special drugs.</div><br><div>The capability for performing a certain finger action, for example, may not be basic in our sense of the word. Being able to extend the finger a certain distance would be basic but the strength and speed of a particular finger motion and its coordination with higher actions generally are usefully changeable and therefore do not represent basic capabilities. What would be basic in this case would perhaps be the processes whereby strength could be increased and coordinated movement patterns learned, as well as the basic movement range established by the mechanical-limit loci of the muscle-tendon-bone system. Similar capability breakdowns will occur for sensory and cognitive capabilities.</div><br><div>b Structure Types</div><br><div>1) General</div><br><div>The fundamental principle used in building sophisticated capabilities from the basic capabilities is structuring--the special type of structuring (which we have termed synergetic) in which the organization of a group of elements produces an effect greater than the mere addition of their individual effects. Perhaps \"purposeful\" structuring (or organization) would serve us as well, but since we aren't sure yet how the structuring concept must mature for our needs, we shall tentatively stick with the special modifier, \"synergetic.\" We are developing a growing awareness of the significant and pervasive nature of such structure within every physical and conceptual thing we inspect, where the hierarchical form seems almost universally present as stemming from successive levels of such organization.</div><br><div>The fundamental entities that are being structured in each and every case seems to be what we could call processes, where the most basic of physical processes (involving fields, charges, and momenta associated with the dynamics of fundamental particles) appear to be the hierarchical base. There are dynamic electro-optical-mechanical processes associated with the function of our artifacts (as well as metabolic, sensory, motor) and cognitive processes of the human, which we find to be relatively fundamental components within the structure of our H-LAM/T system--and each of these seems truly to be ultimately based (to our degree of understanding) upon the above mentioned basic physical processes. The elements that are organized to give fixed structural form to our physical objects--e.g., the \"element\" of tensile strength of a material-are also derived from what we could call synergetic structuring of the most basic physical processes.</div><br><div>But at the level of the capability hierarchy where we wish to work, it seems useful to us to distinguish several different types of structuring--even though each type is fundamentally a structuring of the basic physical processes. Tentatively we have isolated five such types--although we are not sure how many we shall ultimately want to use in considering the problem of augmenting the human intellect, nor how we might divide and subdivide these different manifestations of physical-process structuring. We use the terms \"mental structuring\", \"concept structuring\", \"symbol structuring\", \"process structuring,\" and \"physical structuring.\"</div><br><div>2) Mental Structuring</div><br><div>Mental structuring is what we call the internal organization of conscious and unconscious mental images, associations, or concepts (or whatever it is that is organized within the human mind) that somehow manages to provide the human with understanding and the basis for such as judgment, intuition, inference, and meaningful action with respect to his environment. There is a term used in psychology, cognitive structure, which so far seems to represent just what we want for our concept of mental structure, but we will not adopt it until we become more sure of what the accepted psychological meaning is and of what we want for our conceptual framework.</div><br><div>For our present purpose, it is irrelevant to worry over what the fundamental mental \"things\" being structured are, or what mechanisms are accomplishing the structuring or making use of what has been structured. We feel reasonably safe in assuming that learning involves some kind of meaningful organization within the brain, and that whatever is so organized or structured represents the operating model of the individual's universe to the mental mechanisms that derive his behavior. And further, our assumption is that when the human in our H/LAM system makes the key decision or action that leads to the solution of a complex problem, it will stem from the state of his mental structure at that time. In this view then, the basic purpose of the system's activity on that problem up to that point has been to develop his mental structure to the state from which the mental mechanisms could derive the key action.</div><br><div>Our school systems attest that there are specific experiences that can be given to a human that will result in development of his mental structure to the point where the behavior derived there from by his mental mechanisms shows us that he has gained new comprehension--in other words, we can do a certain amount from outside the human toward developing his mental structure. Independent students and researchers also attest that internally directed behavior on the part of an individual can directly aid his structure-building process.</div><br><div>We don't know whether a mental structure is developed in a manner analogous to (a) development of a garden, where one provides a good environment, plants the seeds, keeps competing weeds and injurious pests out, but otherwise has to let natural processes take their course, or to (b) development of a basketball team, where much exercise of skills, patterns, and strategies must be provided so that natural processes can slowly knit together an integration, or to (c) development of a machine, where carefully formed elements are assembled in a precise, planned manner so that natural phenomena can immediately yield planned function. We don't know the processes, but we can and have developed empirical relationships between the experiences given a human and the associated manifestations of developing comprehension and capability, and we see the near-future course of the research toward augmenting the human's intellect as depending entirely upon empirical findings (past and future) for the development of better means to serve the development and use of mental structuring in the human.</div><br><div>We don't mean to imply by this that we renounce theories of mental processes. What we mean to emphasize is that pursuit of our objective need not wait upon the understanding of the mental processes that accomplish (what we call) mental structuring and that derive behavior therefrom. It would be to ignore the emphases of our own conceptual framework not to make fullest use of any theory that provided a working explanation for a group of empirical data. What's more, our entire conceptual framework represents the first pass at a \"theoretical model with which to organize our thinking and action.\"</div><br><div>3) Concept Structuring</div><br><div>Within our framework we have developed the working assumption that the manner in which we seem to be able to provide experiences that favor the development of our mental structures is based upon concepts as a \"medium of exchange.\" We view a concept as a tool that can be grasped and used by the mental mechanisms, that can be composed, interpreted, and used by the natural mental substances and processes. The grasping and handling done by these mechanisms can often be facilitated if the concept is given an explicit \"handle\" in the form of a representative symbol. Somehow the mental mechanisms can learn to manipulate images (or something) of symbols in a meaningful way and remain calmly confident that the associated conceptual manipulations are within call.</div><br><div>Concepts seem to be structurable, in that a new concept can be composed of an organization of established concepts. For present purposes, we can view a concept structure as something which we might try to develop on paper for ourselves or work with by conscious thought processes, or as something which we try to communicate to one another in serious discussion. We assume that, for a given unit of comprehension to be imparted, there is a concept structure (which can be consciously developed and displayed) that can be presented to an individual in such a way that it is mapped into a corresponding mental structure which provides the basis for that individual's \"comprehending\" behavior. Our working assumption also considers that some concept structures would be better for this purpose than others, in that they would be more easily mapped by the individual into workable mental structures, or in that the resulting mental structures enable a higher degree of comprehension and better solutions to problems, or both.</div><br><div>A concept structure often grows as part of a cultural evolution--either on a large scale within a large segment of society, or on a small scale within the activity domain of an individual. But it is also something that can be directly designed or modified, and a basic hypothesis of our study is that better concept structures can be developed-- structures that when mapped into a human's mental structure will significantly improve his capability to comprehend and to find solutions within his complex-problem situations.</div><br><div>A natural language provides its user with a readymade structure of concepts that establishes a basic mental structure, and that allows relatively flexible, general-purpose concept structuring. Our concept of language as one of the basic means for augmenting the human intellect embraces all of the concept structuring which the human may make use of.</div><br><div>4) Symbol Structuring</div><br><div>The other important part of our \"language\" is the way in which concepts are represented--the symbols and symbol structures. Words structured into phrases, sentences, paragraphs, monographs--charts, lists, diagrams, tables, etc. A given structure of concepts can be represented by any of an infinite number of different symbol structures, some of which would be much better than others for enabling the human perceptual and cognitive apparatus to search out and comprehend the conceptual matter of significance and/or interest to the human. For instance, a concept structure involving many numerical data would generally be much better represented with Arabic rather than Roman numerals and quite likely a graphic structure would be better than a tabular structure.</div><br><div>But it is not only the form of a symbol structure that is important. A problem solver is involved in a stream of conceptual activity whose course serves his mental needs of the moment. The sequence and nature of these needs are quite variable, and yet for each need he may benefit significantly from a form of symbol structuring that is uniquely efficient for that need.</div><br><div>Therefore, besides the forms of symbol structures that can be constructed and portrayed, we are very much concerned with the speed and flexibility with which one form can be transfcrmed into another, and with which new material can be located and portrayed.</div><br><div>We are generally used to thinking of our symbol structures as a pattern of marks on a sheet of paper. When we want a different symbol-structure view, we think of shifting our point of attention on the sheet, or moving a new sheet into position. But another kind of view might be obtained by extracting and ordering all statements in the local text that bear upon consideration A of the argument--or by replacing all occurrences of specified esoteric words by one's own definitions. This sort of \"view generation\" becomes quite feasible with a computer-controlled display system, and represents a very significant capability to build upon.</div><br><div>With a computer manipulating our symbols and generating their portrayals to us on a display, we no longer need think of our looking at the symbol structure which is stored--as we think of looking at the symbol structures stored in notebooks, memos, and books. What the computer actually stores need be none of our concern, assuming that it can portray symbol structures to us that are consistent with the form in which we think our information is structured.</div><br><div>A given concept structure can be represented with a symbol structure that is completely compatible with the computer's internal way of handling symbols, with all sorts of characteristics and relationships given explicit identifications that the user may never directly see. In fact, this structuring has immensely greater potential for accurately mapping a complex concept structure than does a structure an individual would find it practical to construct or use on paper.</div><br><div>The computer can transform back and forth between the two-dimensional portrayal on the screen, of some limited view of the total structure, and the aspect of the n-dimensional internal image that represents this \"view\". If the human adds to or modifies such a \"view,\" the computer integrates the change into the internal-image symbol structure (in terms of the computer's favored symbols and structuring) and thereby automatically detects a certain proportion of his possible conceptual inconsistencies.</div><br><div>Thus, inside this instrument (the computer) there is an internal-image, computer-symbol structure whose convolutions and multi-dimensionality we can learn to shape to represent to hitherto unattainable accuracy the concept structure we might be building or working with. This interna1 structure may have a form that is nearly incomprehensible to the direct inspection of a human (except in minute chunks).</div><br><div>But let the human specify to the instrument his particular conceptual need of the moment, relative to this internal image. Without disrupting its own internal reference structure in the slightest, the computer will effectively stretch, bend, fold, extract, and cut as it may need in order to assemble an internal substructure that is its respons, structured in its own internal way. With the set of standard translation rules appropriate to the situation, it portrays to the human via its display a symbol structure designed for his quick and accurate perception and comprehension of the conceptual matter pertinent to this internally composed substructure.</div><br><div>No longer does the human work on stiff and limited symbol structures, where much of the conceptual content can only be implicitly designated in an indirect and distributed fashion. These new ways of working are basically available with today's technology--we have but to free ourselves from some of our limiting views and begin experimenting with compatible sets of structure forms and processes for human concepts, human symbols, and machine symbols.</div><br><div>5) Process Structuring</div><br><div>Essentially everything that goes on within the H-LAM/T system and that is of direct interest here involves the manipulation of concept and symbol structures in service to the mental structure. Therefore, the processes within the H-LAM/T system that we are most interested in developing are those that provide for the manipulation of all three types of structure. This brings us to the fourth category of structuring, process structuring.</div><br><div>As we are currently using it, the term</div><br><div>includes the organization, study, modification, and execution of processes and process structures. Whereas concept structuring and symbol structuring together represent the language component of our augmentation means, process structuring represents the methodology component (plus a little more, actually). There has been enough previous discussion of process structures that we need not describe the notion here, beyond perhaps an example or two. The individual processes (or actions) of my hands and fingers have to be cooperatively organized if the typewriter is to do my bidding. My successive actions throughout my working day are meant to cooperate toward a certain over-all professional goal.</div><br><div>Many of the process structures are applied to the task of organizing, executing, supervising, and evaluating other process structures. Many of them are applied to the formation and manipulation of symbol structures (the purpose of which will often be to support the conceptual labor involved in process structuring).</div><br><div>6) Physical Structuring</div><br><div>Physical structuring, the last of the five types which we currently use in our conceptual framework, is nearly self-explanatory. It pretty well represents the artifact component of our augmentation means, insofar as their actual physical construction is concerned.</div><br><div>7) Interdependence and Regeneration</div><br><div>A very important feature to be noted from the discussion in this section bears upon the interdependence among the various types of structuring which are involved in the H-LAM/T system, where the capability for doing each type of structuring is dependent upon the capability for doing one or more of the other types of structuring. (Assuming that the physical structuring of the system remains basically unchanged during the system's operation, we exclude its dependence upon other factors in this discussion.)</div><br><div>This interdependence actually has a cyclic, regenerative nature to it which is very significant to us. We have seen how the capability for mental structuring is finally dependent, down the chain, upon the process structuring (human, artifact, composite) that enables symbol-structure manipulation. But it also is evident that the process structuring is dependent not only upon basic human and artifact process capabilities, but upon the ability of the human to learn how to execute processes--and no less important, upon the ability of the human to select, organize, and modify processes from his repertoire to structure a higher-order process that he can execute. Thus, a capability for structuring and executing processes is partially dependent upon the human's mental structuring, which in turn is partially dependent upon his process structuring (through concept and symbol structuring), which is partially dependent upon his mental structuring, etc.</div><br><div>All of this means that a significant improvement in symbol-structure manipulation through better process structuring (initially perhaps through much better artifacts) should enable us to develop improvements in concept and mental-structure manipulations that can in turn enable us to organize and execute symbol-manipulation processes of increased power. To most people who initially consider the possibilities for computer-like devices augmenting the human intellect, it is only the one-pass improvement that comes to mind, which presents a picture that is relatively barren compared to that which emerges when one considers this regenerative interaction.</div><br><div>We can confidently expect the development of much more powerful concepts pertaining to the manner in which symbol structures can be manipulated and portrayed, and correspondingly more complex manipulation processes that in the first pass would have been beyond the human's power to organize and execute without the better symbol, concept, and mental structuring which his augmented system provided him. These new concepts and processes, beyond our present capabilities to use and thus never developed, will provide a tremendous increased-capability payoff in the future development of our augmentation means.</div><br><div>c. Roles and Levels</div><br><div>In the repertoire hierarchy of capabilities possessed by the H-LAM/T system, the human contributes many types of capability that represent a wide variety of roles. At one time or another he will be the policy maker, the goal setter, the performance supervisor, the work scheduler, the professional specialist, the clerk, the janitor, the entrepreneur, and the proprietor (or at least a major stockholder) of the system. In the midst of some complex process, in fact, he may well be playing several roles concurrently--or at least have the responsibility of the roles. For instance, usually he must be aware of his progress toward a goal (supervisor), he must be alert to the possibilities for changing the goal (policy maker, planner), and he must keep records for these and other roles (clerk).</div><br><div>Consider a given capability (Capability 1) at some level in the repertoire hierarchy. There seems to be a sort of standard grouping of lower-order capabilities from which this is composed, and these exist in two classes--what we might call the executive class and what we might call the direct-contributive class. In the executive class of capabilities we find those used for comprehending, planning, and executing the process represented by Capability 1. In the direct-contributive class we find the capabilities organized by the executive class toward the direct realization of Capability 1. For example, when my telephone rings, I execute the direct-contributive processes of picking up the receiver and saying hello. It was the executive processes that comprehended the situation, directed a lower-order executive-process that the receiver be picked up and, when the receiver was in place (first process accomplished), directed the next process, the saying hello. That represents the composition of my capability for answering the phone.</div><br><div>For a low-level capability, such as that of writing a word with a pencil, both the executive and the direct-contributive subprocesses during actual execution would be automatic. This type of automatic capability need only be summoned by a higher executive process in order for trained automatic responses to execute it.</div><br><div>At a little higher level of capability, more of the conscious conceptual and executive capabilities become involved. To call someone on the telephone, I must consciously comprehend the need for this process and how I can execute it, I must consciously pick up the directory and search for the name and telephone number, and I must consciously direct the dialing of the number.</div><br><div>At a still higher level of capability, the executive capabilities must have a degree of power that unaided mental capabilities cannot provide. In such a case, one might make a list of steps and check each item off as it is executed. For an even more complex process, comprehending the particular situation in which it is to be executed, even before beginning to plan the execution, may take months of labor and a very complex organization of the system's capabilities.</div><br><div>Imagining a process as complex as the last example brings us to the realization that at any particular moment the H-LAM/T system may be in the middle of executing a great number of processes. Assume that the human is in the middle of the process of making a telephone call. That telephone call is a subprocess in the middle of the process of calling a committee meeting. But calling a committee meeting is a subprocess in the middle of the process of determining a budgetary policy, which is in turn but a subprocess in the middle of the process of estimating manpower needs, and so on.</div><br><div>Not only does the human need to play various roles (sometimes concurrently) in the execution of any given process, but he is playing these roles for the many concurrent processes that are being executed at different levels. This situation is typical for any of us engaged in reasonably demanding types of professional pursuits, and yet we have never received explicit training in optimum ways of carrying out any but a very few of the roles at a very few of the levels. A well-designed H-LAM/T system would provide explicit and effective concepts, terms, equipment, and methods for all these roles, and for their dynamic coordination.</div><br><div>d. Model of Executive Superstructure</div><br><div>It is the repertoire hierarchy of process capabilities upon which the ultimate capability of the H-LAM/T system rests. This repertoire hierarchy is rather like a mountain of white-collar talent that sits atop and controls the talents of the workers. We can illustrate this executive superstructure by considering it as though it were a network of contractors and subcontractors in which each capability in the repertoire hierarchy is represented by an independent contractor whose mode of operation is to do the planning, make up specifications, subcontract the actual work, and supervise the performance of his subcontractors. This means that each subcontractor does the same thing in his turn. At the bottom of this hierarchy are those independent contractors who do actual \"production work.\"</div><br><div>If by some magical process the production workers could still know just what to do and when to do it even though the superstructure of contractors was removed from above them, no one would know the difference. The executive superstructure is necessary because humans do not operate by magic, but even a necessary superstructure is a burden. We can readily recognize that there are many ways to organize and manage such a superstructure, resulting in vastly different degrees of efficiency in the application of the workers' talents.</div><br><div>Suppose that the activity of the production workers was of the same nature as the activity of the different contractors, and that this activity consisted of gaining comprehension and solving problems. And suppose that there was only so much applicable talent available to the total system. The question now becomes how to distribute that talent between superstructure and workers to get the most total production. The efficiency of organization within the superstructure is now doubly important so that a minimum of talent in the superstructure produces a maximum of organizational efficiency in directing the productivity of the remaining talent.</div><br><div>In the situation where talent is limited, we find a close parallel to our H-LAM/T system in its pursuit of comprehension and problem solutions. We obtain an even closer parallel if we say that the thinking, planning, supervising, record keeping, etc., for each contractor is actually done by a single individual for the whole superstructure, time- sharing his attention and talents over these many tasks. Today this individual cannot be depended upon to have any special training for many of these roles; he is likely to have learned them by cut and try and by indirect imitation.</div><br><div>A complex process is often executed by the H-LAM/T system in a multi-pass fashion (i.e., cut and try). In really complex situations, comprehension and problem solutions do not stand waiting at the end of a straightforward path; instead, possibilities open up and plans shift as comprehension grows. In the model using a network of contractors, this type of procedure would entail a great deal of extra work within the superstructure--each contractor involved in the process would have the specifications upon which he bid continually changed, and would continually have to respond to the changes by restudying the situation, changing his plans, changing the specifications to his subcontractors, and changing his records. This is a terrific additional burden, but it allows a freedom of action that has tremendous importance to the effectiveness the system exhibits to the outside world.</div><br><div>We could expect significant gains from automating the H- LAM/T system if a computer could do nothing more than increase the effectiveness of the executive processes. More human time, energy, and productive thought could be allocated to direct-contributive processes, which would be coordinated in a more sophisticated, flexible and efficient manner. But there is every reason to believe that the possibilities for much-improved symbol and process structuring that would stem from this automation will directly provide improvements in both the executive and direct-contributive processes in the system.</div><br><div>e. Flexibility in the Executive Role</div><br><div>The executive superstructure is a necessary component in the H-LAM/T system, and there is finite human capability which must be divided between executive and direct-contributive activities. An important aspect of the multi-role activity of the human in the system is the development and manipulation of the symbol structures associated with both his direct-contributive roles and his executive roles.</div><br><div>When the system encounters a complex situation in which comprehension and problem solutions are being pursued, the direct-contributive roles require the development of symbol structures that portray the concepts involved within the situation. But executive roles in a complex problem situation also require conceptual activity--e.g., comprehension, selection, supervision--that can benefit from well-designed symbol structures and fast, flexible means for manipulating and displaying them. For complex processes, the executive problem posed to the human (of gaining the necessary comprehension and making a good plan) may be tougher than the problem he faced in the role of direct-contributive worker. If the flexibility desired for the process hierarchies (to make room for human cut-and-try methods) is not to be degraded or abandoned, the executive activity will have to be provided with fast and flexible symbol-structuring techniques.</div><br><div>The means available to humans today for developing and manipulating these symbol structures are both laborious and inflexible. It is hard enough to develop an initial structure of diagrams and text, but the amount of effort required to make changes is often prohibitively great; one settles for inflexibility. Also, the kind of generous flexibility that would be truly helpful calls for added symbol structuring just to keep track of the trials, branches, and reasoning thereto that are involved in the development of the subject structure; our present symbol-manipulation means would very soon bog down completely among the complexities that are involved in being more than just a little bit flexible.</div><br><div>We find that the humans in our H-LAM/T systems are essential working continuously within a symbol structure of some sort, shifting their attention from one structure to another as they guide and execute the processes that ultimately provide them with the comprehension and the problem solutions that they seek. This view increases our respect for the essential importance of the basic capability of composing and modifying efficient symbol structures. Such a capability depends heavily upon the particular concepts that are isolated and manipulated as entities, upon the symbology used to represent them, upon the artifacts that help to manipulate and display the symbols, and upon the methodology for developing and using symbol structures. In other words, this capability depends heavily upon proper language, artifacts, and methodology, our basic augmentation means.</div><br><div>When the course of action must respond to new comprehension, new insights and new intuitive flashes of possible explanations or solutions, it will not be an orderly process. Existing means of composing and working with symbol structures penalize disorderly processes very heavily, and it is part of the real promise in the automated H-LAM/T systems of tomorrow that the human can have the freedom and power of disorderly processes.</div><br><div>f. Compound Effects</div><br><div>Since many processes in many levels of the hierarchy are involved in the execution of a single higher-level process of the system, any factor that influences process execution in general will have a highly compounded total effect upon the system's performance. There are several such factors which merit special attention.</div><br><div>Basic human cognitive powers, such as memory intelligence, or pattern perception can have such a compounded effect. The augmentation means employed today have generally evolved among large statistical populations, and no attempt has been made to fit them to individual needs and abilities. Each individual tends to evolve his own variations, but there is not enough mutation and selection activity, nor enough selection feedback, to permit very significant changes. A good, automated H-LAM/T system should provide the opportunity for a significant adaptation of the augmentation means to individual characteristics. The compounding effect of fundamental human cognitive powers suggests further that systems designed for maximum effectiveness would require that these powers be developed as fully as possible--by training, special mental tricks, improved language, new methodology.</div><br><div>In the automated system that we contemplate, the human should be able to draw on explicit-artifact process capability at many levels in the repertoire hierarchy; today, artifacts are involved explicitly in only the lower-order capabilities. In the future systems, for instance, it should be possible to have computer processes provide direct and significant help in his processes at many levels. We thus expect the effect of the computer in the system to be very much compounded. A great deal of richness in the future possibilities for automated H-LAM/T systems is implied here--considerably more than many people realize who would picture the computer as just helping them do the things they do now. This type of compounding is related to the reverberating waves of change discussed in Section II-A.</div><br><div>Another factor can exert this type of compound effect upon over-all system performance: the human's unconscious processes. Clinical psychology seems to provide clear evidence that a large proportion of a human's everyday activity is significantly mediated or basically prompted by unconscious mental processes that, although \"natura\" in a functional sense, are not rational. The observable mechanisms of these processes (observable by another, trained person) includes masking of the irrationality of the human's actions which are so affected, so that few of us will admit that our actions might be irrational, and most of us can construct satisfying rationales for any action that may be challenged.</div><br><div>Anything that might have so general an effect upon our mental actions as is implied here, is certainly a candidate for ultimate consideration in the continuing development of our intellectual effectiveness. It may be that the first stages of research on augmenting the human intellect will have to proceed without being able to do anything about this problem except accommodate to it as well as possible. This may be one of the very significant problems whose solution awaits our development of increased intellectual effectiveness.</div><br><div>III. EXAMPLES AND DISCUSSION</div><br><div>A. BACKGROUND</div><br><div>The conceptual structure which we have evolved to orient and guide the pursuit of increasing man's intellectual effectiveness has been des cribed in the foregoing sections in a rather general and abstract fashion. In this section we shall try to develop more concrete images of these concepts, of some of the future possibilities for augmentation, and of the relationship between these different concepts and possibilities.</div><br><div>It must be borne in mind that a great deal of study and invention is yet to be done in developing the improved augmentation means that are bound to come, and that the examples which we present in this report are intended only to show what is meant by the generalizations which we use, and to provide a feeling on the part of the reader for the richness and power of the improvements we can likely develop in our augmentation means. Many of the examples are realizable today (in fact, some have been realized) and most of the rest are reasonably straight forward extrapolations into the near future. We predict that what actually develops in the new augmentation means will be consistent with our conceptual framework, but that the particulars will be full of surprises.</div><br><div>Each of the examples will show a facet of how the little steps that the human can take with his sensory-mental-motor apparatus can be organized cooperatively with the capabilities of artifacts to accomplish significant things in the way of achieving comprehension and solving problems. This organization, as we have shown in Section II, can be viewed as the five different types of structuring which we outlined, where much of the structuring that goes on in the human's total problem solving activity is for the purpose of building a mental structure which in a way \"puts the human up where he can see what is going on and can point the direction to move next.\"</div><br><div>An early paper, offering suggestions toward augmenting the human intellect, that fits well and significantly within the framework which we have developed was written by Vannevar Bush (6) in 1945. Indeed, it fits so well, and states its points so nicely, thst it was deemed appropriate to our purpose here to summarize it in detail and to quote from it at considerable length.</div><br><div>1. What Vannevar Bush proposed in 1945</div><br><div>He wrote as World War II was coming to an end, and his principal purpose seemed to be to offer new professional objectives to those scientists who were soon to be freed from war-motivated research and development. It would seem that he also wished to induce a general recognition of a growing problem--storage, retrieval, and manipulation of information for and by intellectual workers--and to show the possibilities he foresaw for scientific development of equipment which could significantly aid such workers in facing this problem. He summarized the situation: \"...There is a growing mountain of research...The investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions of thousands of other workers. Professionally our methods of transmitting and reviewing the results of research are generations old...truly significant attainments become lost in the mass of the inconsequential...The summation of human experience is being expanded at a prodigious rate, and the means we use for threading through the consequent maze to the momentarily important item is the same as was used in the days of square-rigged ships.\"</div><br><div>Then he brought out some general considerations for hope: \".. But there are signs of a change as new and powerful instrumentalities come into use...Photocells...advanced photography...thermionic tubes... cathode ray tubes...relay combinations...there are plenty of mechanical aids with which to effect a transformation in scientific records.\" And he points out that devices which we commonly use today--e.g., a calculating machine or an automobile--would have been impossibly expensive to produce in earlier eras of our technological development. \"...The world has arrived at an age of cheap complex devices of great reliability and something is bound to come of it.\"</div><br><div>In six and a half pages crammed full of well-based speculations, Bush proceeds to outline enough plausible artifact and methodology developments to make a very convincing case for the augmentation of the individual intellectual worker. Extension of existing photographic techniques to give each individual a continuously available miniature camera for recording anything in view and of interest, and to realize a high-quality 100:1 linear reduction ratio for micro-record files for these photographs and published material; voice-recognition equipment (perhaps requiring a special language) to ease the process of entering new self-generated material into the written record--these are to provide the individual with information-generating aid.</div><br><div>For the detailed manipulation of mathematical and logical expressions, Bush projects computing aids (which have been surpassed by subsequent development) that allow the individual to exercise a greater proportion of his time and talents in the tasks of selecting data and the appropriate transformations and processes which are to be executed, leaving to the machinery the subsequent execution. He suggests that new notation for our verbal symbols (perhaps binary) could allow character recognition devices to help even further in the information-manipulation area, and also points out that poor symbolism (\"...the exceedingly crude way in which mathematicians express their relationships. They employ a symbolism which grew like Topsy and has little consistency; a strange fact in that most logical field.\") stands in the way of full realization of machine help for the manipulations associated with the human's real time process of mathematical work. And \"...Then, on beyond the strict logic of the mathematician, lies the application of logic in everyday affairs. We may some day click off arguments on a machine with the same assurance that we now enter sales on a cash register.\"</div><br><div>Then \" ..So much for the manipulation of ideas and their insertion into the record. Thus far we seem to be worse off than before--for we can enormously extend the record; yet even in its present bulk we can hardly consult it. This is a much larger matter than merely the extraction of data for the purposes of scientific research; it involves the entire process by which man profits by his inheritance of acquired knowledge The prime action of use is selection, and here we are halting indeed. There may be millions of fine thoughts, and the account of the experience on which they are based, all encased within stone walls of acceptable architectural form; but if the scholar can get at only one a week by diligent search, his syntheses are not likely to keep up with the current scene.\" He goes on to discuss possible developments that could allow very rapid (in the human's time frame) selection of unit records from a very large file--where the records could be dry-process photographic micro-images upon which the user could add lnformation at will.</div><br><div>Bush goes on to say, \"The real heart of the matter of selection, however, goes deeper than a lag in the adoption of mechanisms...Our ineptitude in getting at the record is largely caused by the artificiality of systems of indexing.\" He observes the power of the associative recall which human memory exhibits, and proposes that a mechanization of selection by association could be realized to considerable advantage. He spends the last two pages (a quarter of his article) describing a device embodying this capability, and points out some features of its use and of its likely effect. This material is so relevant and so well put that I quote it in its entirety:</div><br><div>\"Consider a future device for individual use, which is a sort of mechanized private file and library. It needs a name, and to coin one at random, \"memex\" will do. A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.</div><br><div>\"It consists of a desk, and while it can presumably be operated from a distance, it is primarily the piece of furniture at which he works. On the top are slanting translucent screens, on which material can be projected for convenient reading. There is a keyboard, and sets of buttons and levers. Otherwise it looks like an ordinary desk.</div><br><div>\"In one end is the stored material. The matter of bulk is well taken care of by improved microfilm. Only a small part of the interior of the memex is devoted to storage, the rest to mechanism. Yet if the user inserted 5000 pages of material a day it would take him hundreds of years to fill the repository, so he can be profligate and enter material freely.</div><br><div>\"Most of the memex contents are purchased on microfilm ready for insertion. Books of all sorts, pictures, current periodicals, newspapers, are thus obtained and dropped into place. Business correspondence takes the same path. And there is provision for direct entry. On the top of the memex is a transparent platen. On this are placed longhand notes, photographs, memoranda, all sort of things. When one is in place, the depression of a lever causes it to be photographed onto the next blank space in a section of the memex film, dry photography being employed.</div><br><div>\"There is, of course, provision for consultation of the record by the usual scheme of indexing. If the user wishes to consult a certain book, he taps its code on the keyboard, and the title page of the book promptly appears before him, projected onto one of his viewing positions. Frequently-used codes are mnemonic, so that he seldom consults his code book; but when he does, a single tap of a key projects it for his use. Moreover, he has supplemental levers. On deflecting one of these levers to the right he runs through the book before him, each page in turn being projected at a speed which just allows a recognizing glance at each. If he deflects it further to the right, he steps through the book 10 pages at a time; still further at 100 pages at a time. Deflection to the left gives him the same control backwards.</div><br><div>\"A special button transfers him immediately to the first page of the index. Any given book of his library can thus be called up and consulted with far greater facility than if it were taken from a shelf. As he has several projection positions, he can leave one item in position while he calls up another. He can add marginal notes and comments, taking advantage of one possible type of dry photography, and it could even be arranged so that he can do this by a stylus scheme, such as is now employed in the telautograph seen in railroad waiting rooms, just as though he had the physical page before him.</div><br><div>\"All this is conventional, except for the projection forward of present-day mechanisms and gadgetry. If affords an immediate step, however, to associative indexing, the basic idea of which is a provision whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another. This is the essential feature of the memex. The process of tying two items together is the important thing.</div><br><div>\"When the user is building a trail, he names it, inserts the name in his code book, and taps it out on his keyboard. Before him are the two items to be joined, projected onto adjacent viewing positions. At the bottom of each there are a number of blank code spaces, and a pointer is set to indicate one of these on each item. The user taps a single key, and the items are permanently joined. In each code space appears the code word. Out of view, but also in the code space, is inserted a set of dots for photocell viewing; and on each item these dots by their positions designate the index number of the other item.</div><br><div>\"Thereafter, at any time, when one of these items is in view, the other can be instantly recalled merely by tapping a button below the corresponding code space. Moreover, when numerous items have been thus joined together to form a trail, they can be reviewed in turn, rapidly or slowly, by deflecting a lever like that used for turning the pages of a book. It is exactly as though the physical items had been gathered together to form a new book. It is more than this, for any item can be joined into numerous trails.</div><br><div>\"The owner of the memex, let us say, is interested in the origin and properties of the bow and arrow. Specifically he is studying why the short Turkish bow was apparently superior to the English long bow in the skirmishes of the Crusades. He has dozens of possibly pertinent books and articles in his memex. First he runs through an encyclopedia, finds and interesting but sketchy article, leaves it projected, Next, in a history, he finds another pertinent item, and ties the two together. Thus he goes, building a trail of many items. Occasionally he inserts a comment of his own, either linking it into the main trail or joining it by a side trail to a particular item. When it becomes evident that the elastic properties of available materials had a great deal to do with the bow, he branches off on a side trail which takes him through textbooks on elasticity and tables of physical constants. He inserts a page of longhand analysis of his own. Thus he builds a trail of his interest through the maze of materials available to him.</div><br><div>\"And his trails do not fade. Several years later, his talk with a friend turns to the queer ways in which a people resist innovations, even of vital interest. He has an example, in the fact that the outranged Europeans still failed to adopt the Turkish bow. In fact he has a trail on it. A touch brings up the code book. Tapping a few keys projects the head of the trail. A lever runs through it at will, stopping at interesting items, going off on side excursions. It is an interesting trail, pertinent to the discussion. So he sets a reproducer in action, photographs the whole trail out, and passes it to his friend for insertion in his own memex, there to be linked into the more general trail.</div><br><div>\"Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready-made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified. The lawyer has at his touch the associated opinions and decisions of his whole experience, and of the experience of friends and authorities. The patent attorney has on call the millions of issued patents, with familiar trails to every point of his client's interest. The physician, puzzled by its patient's reactions, strikes the trail established in studying an earlier similar case, and runs rapidly through analogous case histories, with side references to the classics for the pertinent anatomy and histology. The chemist, struggling with the synthesis of an organic compound, has all the chemical literature before him in his laboratory, with trails following the analogies of compounds, and side trails to their physical and chemical behavior.</div><br><div>\"The historian, with a vast chronological account of a people, parallels it with a skip trail which stops only at the salient items, and can follow at any time contemporary trails which lead him all over civilization at a particular epoch. There is a new profession of trail blazers, those who find delight in the task of establishing useful trails through the enormous mass of the common record. The inheritance from the master becomes, not only his additions to the world's record, but for his disciples the entire scaffolding by which they were erected.</div><br><div>\"Thus science may implement the ways in which man produces, stores, and consults the record of the race. It might be striking to outline the instrumentalities of the future more spectacularly, rather than to stick closely to the methods and elements now known and undergoing rapid development, as has been done here. Technical difficulties of all sorts have been ignored, certainly, but also ignored are means as yet unknown which may come any day to accelerate technical progress as violently as did the advent of the thermionic tube. In order that the picture may not be too commonplace, by reason of sticking to present-day patterns, it may be well to mention one such possibility, not to prophesy but merely to suggest, for prophecy based on extension of the known has substance, while prophecy founded on the unknown is only a doubly involved guess.</div><br><div>\"All our steps in creating or absorbing material of the record proceed through one of the senses - the tactile when we touch keys, the oral when we speak or listen, the visual when we read.

This is an exact analogy with the electrical vibrations which occur in the cable of a television set: they convey the picture from the photocells which see it to the radio transmitter from which it is broadcast. We know further that if we can approach that cable with the proper instruments, we do not need to touch it; we can pick up those vibrations by electrical induction and thus discover and reproduce the scene which is being transmitted, just as a telephone wire may be tapped for its message.</div><br><div>\"The impulse which flow in the arm nerves of a typist convey to her fingers the translated information which reaches her eye or ear, in order that the fingers may be caused to strike the proper keys.

Is it not possible that we may learn to introduce them without the present cumbersomeness of first transforming electrical vibrations to mechanical ones, which the human mechanism promptly transforms back to the electrical form? With a couple of electrodes on the skull the encephalograph now produces pen-and-ink traces which bear some relation to the electrical phenomena going on in the brain itself. True, the record is unintelligible, except as it points out certain gross misfunctioning of the cerebral mechanism; but who would now place bounds on where such a thing may lead?</div><br><div>\"In the outside world, all forms of intelligence, whether of sound or sight, have been reduced to the form of varying currents in an electric circuit in order that they may be transmitted. Inside the human frame exactly the same sort of process occurs. Must we always transform to mechanical movements in order to proceed from one electrical phenomenon to another? It is a suggestive thought, but it hardly warrants prediction without losing touch with reality and immediateness.</div><br><div>\"Presumably man's spirit should be elevated if he can better review his shady past and analyze more completely and objectively his present problems. He has built a civilization so complex that he needs to mechanize his record more fully if he is to push his experiment to its logical conclusion and not merely become bogged down part way there by overtaxing his limited memory. His excursion may be more enjoyable if he can reacquire the privilege of forgetting the manifold things he does not need to have immediately at hand, with some assurance that he can find them again if they prove important.</div><br><div>\"The applications of science have built man a well-supplied house, and are teaching him to live healthily therein. They have enabled him to throw masses of people against another with cruel weapons. They may yet allow him truly to encompass the great record and to grow in the wisdom of race experience. He may perish in conflict before he learns to wield that record for his true good. Yet, in the application of science to the needs and desires of man, it would seem to be a singularly unfortunate stage at which to terminate the process, or to lose hope as to the outcome.</div><br><div>2. Comments Related to Bush's Article</div><br><div>There are many significant items in the article, but the main ones upon which we shall comment here will be those relative to the use and implications of his Memex. The associative trails whose establishment and use within the files he describes at some length provide a beautiful example of a new capsbility in symbol structuring that derives from new artifact-process capability, and that provides new ways to develop and portray concept structures. Any file is a symbol structure whose purpose is to represent a variety of concepts and concept structures in a way that makes them maximally available and useful to the needs of the human's mental-structure development -- within the limits imposed by the capability of the artifacts and human for jointly executing processes of symbol-structure manipulation. The Memex allows a human user to do more conveniently (less energy, more quickly) what he could have done with relatively ordinary photographic equipment and filing systems, but he would have had to spend so much time in the lower-level processes of manipulation that his mental time constants of memory and patience would have rendered the system unusable in the detailed and intimate sense which Bush illustrates.</div><br><div>The Memex adds a factor of speed and convenience to ordinary filing-system (symbol-structuring) processes that would encourage new methods of work by the user, and it also adds speed and convenience for processes not generally used before. Making it easy to establish and follow the associative trails makes practical a new symbol-structuring process whose use can make a significant difference in the concept structuring and basic methods of work. It is also probable that clever usage of associative-trail manipulation can augment the human's process structuring and executing capacilities so that he could successfully make use of even more powerful symbol-structure manlpulation processes utilizing the Memex capabilities. An example of this general sort of thing was given by Bush where he points out that the file index can be called to view at the push of a button, which implicitly provides greater capability to work within more sophisticated and complex indexing systems</div><br><div>Note, too, the implications extending from Bush's mention of one user duplicating a trail (a portion of his structure) and giving it to a friend who can put it into his Memex and integrate it into his own trail (structure). Also note the \"wholly new forms of encyclopedia\", the profession of \"trail blazers,\" and the inheritance from a master including \"the entire scaffolding\" by which such additions to the world's record were erected. These illustrate the types of changes in the ways in which people can cooperate intellectually that can emerge from the augmentation of the individuals. This type of change represents a very significant part of the potential value in pursuing research directly on the means for making individuals intellectually more effective.</div><br><div>3. Some Possibilities with Cards and Relatively Simple Equipment</div><br><div>A number of useful new structuring processes can be made available to an individual through development and use of relatively simple equipment that is mostly electromechanical in nature and relatively cheap. We can begin developing examples of this by describing the hand operated, edge-notched card system that I developed and used over the past eight years.</div><br><div>a. An Existing Note and File System</div><br><div>The \"unit records\" here, unlike those in the Memex example, are generally scraps of typed or handwritten text on IBM-card sized edge-notchable cards. These represent little \"kernels\" of data, thought, fact, considerationJ concepts, ideas, worries, etc., that are relevant to a given problem area in my professional life. Each such specific problem area has its notecards kept in a separate deck, and for each such deck there is a master card with descriptors associated with individual holes about the periphery of the card. There is a field of holes reserved for notch coding the serial number of a reference from which the note on a card may have been taken, or the serial number corresponding to an individual from whom the information came directly (including a code for myself, for self-generated thoughts).</div><br><div>None of the principles of indexing or sorting used here is new: coordinate-indexing descriptors with direct coding on edge notched cards, with needle-sort retrieval. Mainly what is new is the use of the smaller units of information, in restricted-subject sets (notedecks) so that I gain considerable flexibility in the manipulations of my thought products at the level at which I actually work in my minute-by-minute struggle with analytical and formulative thought. Not only do my own thoughts produce results in this fashion, but when I digest the writings of another person, I find generally anyway that I have extracted from his structure and integrated into my own a specific selection of facts, considerations, ideas, etc. Often these different extracted items fit into different places in my structure, or become encased in special substructures as I modify or expand his concepts. Extracting such items or kernels and putting each on its own notecard helps this process considerably--the role or position of each such item in the growth of the note structure is independent, and yet if desired all can quickly be isolated and extracted by simple needle sorting on the reference-number notching field.</div><br><div>These notecards represent much more than just an in formation file. They provide a workspace for me, in which I can browse, make additions or corrections, or build new sets of thought kernels with a good deal of freedom. I can leave notes with suggestions or questions for myself that will drop out at an appropriate later time. I can do document-reference searches with good efficiency, too, by needle sorting for notes within relevant descriptor categories Any notecard with relevant notes on it points to the original source (by the source serial number, which I always write, together with the page, at the top of the card). When I am in the process of developing an integrated writeup covering some or all of the notedeck'g material, I can quickly needle out a set of cards relevant to the topic under consideration at the moment--with all other cards in one pile to the side--and I need do a very minimum of hand searching or stacking in special little category piles. If I utilize specific information from another person, I can register my acknowledgment in my draft writeup merely by writing in the source serial number that is at the top of the notecard--it is a straight forward clerical job for a secretary later to arrange footnote entries and numbering.</div><br><div>b. Comments on the System</div><br><div>First, let me relate what has been described to the special terms brought out in previous sections. The writing contained on each notecard is a small-sized symbol structure, representing or portraying to me a small structure of concepts. The notches on the edges of the cards are symbols that serve to tie these card-sized symbol sub structures into a large symbol structure (the notedeck). One aspect of the structure is the physical grouping of the cards at a given time-- which happens to be the only aspect of the over-all structuring that my human capabilities can make direct use of--and in this respect I can execute processes which produce restructuring (that is, physical re grouping) that helps me considerably to perceive and assimilate the concepts of worth to me. This restructuring is effected by composite processes involving me, a master code card, a sorting needle, and a work surface. I can add to the symbol structure by executing other composite processes which involve me, writing instruments (pen, pencil, or type writer), a master code card, and a card notcher.</div><br><div>If my mental processes were more powerful, I could dispense with the cards, and hold all of the card-sized concept structures in my memory, where also would be held the categorization linkages that evolved as I worked (with my feet up on the artifacts and my eyes closed). As it is, and as it probably always will be no matter how we develop or train our mental capabilities, I want to work in problem areas where the number and interrelationship complexity of the individual factors involved are too much for me to hold and manipulate within my mind. So, my mind develops conscious sets of concepts, or recognizes and selects them from what it perceives in the work of others, and it directs the organization of an external symbol structure in which can be held and portrayed to the mind those concepts I cannot (reliably) remember or whose manipulations I cannot visualize. The price I pay for this augmentation shows up in the time and energy involved in manipulating artifacts to manipulate symbols to give me this artificial memory and visualization of concepts and their manipulation.</div><br><div>c. Associative-Linking Possibilities</div><br><div>But let us go further with discussing specific examples of means for augmenting our intellects. In using the edge-notched-card system described, I found several types of structuring which that system could not provide, but which would both be very useful and probably ob tainable with reasonably practical artifact means. One need arose quite commonly as trains of thought would develop on a growing series of note cards. There was no convenient way to link these cards together so that the train of thought could later be recalled by extracting the ordered series of notecards. An associative-trail scheme similar to that out lined by Bush for his Memex could conceivably be implemented with these cards to meet this need and add a valuable new symbol-structuring process to the system. Straightforward engineering development could provide a mechanism that would be able to select a specific card from a relatively large deck by a parallel edge-notch sort on a unique serial number notched into each card, and the search mechanism could be set up automatically by a hole sensing mechanism from internal punches on another card that was placed in the sensing slot. An auxiliary notching mechanism could automatically give succeeding serial-number encoding to new notecards as they are made up.</div><br><div>Suppose that one wants to link Card B to Card A, to make a trail from A to B. He puts Card B into a slot so that the edge-notched coding of the card's serial number can automatically be sensed, and slips Card A under a hole-punching head which duplicates the serial-number code of Card B in the coding of the holes punched in a speciflc zone on Card A. Later, when he may have discovered Card A, and wishes to follow this particular associative trail to the next card, he aligns that zone on Card A under a hole-sensing head which reads the serial number for Card B therein and automatically sets up the sorting mechanism. A very quick and simple human process thus initiates the automatic extraction of the next item on the associative trail. It's not unreasonable to assume that establishing a link would take about three seconds, and tracing a link to the next card about three to five seconds.</div><br><div>There would still be descriptor-code notching and selection to provide for general grouping classifications--and we can see that the system could really provide a means for working within the structure of the contained information.</div><br><div>d. An Experiment Illustrating Usage and Further System Possibilities</div><br><div>I once tried to use my cards, with their separate little \"concept packets,\" in the process of developing a file memo outlining the status and plans of a research project. I first developed a set of cards upon each of which I described a separate consideration, possibility, or specification about the memo--in the disorderly sequence in which they occurred to me as my thoughts about the basic features of the memo evolved. Right off the bat I noticed that there were two distinct groups--some ideas were about what the memo ought to accomplish, what time period it should cover, when it should be finished, what level and style of presentation should be used, etc., and some ideas were about the sub ject of the memo. As more thoughts developed, I found that the latter group also divided into ideas representing possible content and those representing possible organization.</div><br><div>I separated the cards into three corresponding groups (which I shall call Specification, Organization, and Content), and began to organize each of them. I started with the Specification group (it being the \"highest\" in nature), and immediately found that there were several types of notes within that group Just as there had been in the total group. Becoming immediately suspicious, I sorted through each of the other two main groups and found similar situations in each. In each group there was finally to emerge a definite set of statements (product statements) that represented that group's purpose--e.g., the specifications currently accepted for the design of the memo--and some of the cards contained candidate material for this. But there were also considerations about what these final statements might include or exclude or take into account, or conditions under which inclusion or modification might be relevant, or statements that were too bulky or brief or imprecise to be used as final statements.</div><br><div>It became apparent that the final issuance from my work, the memo itself, would represent but one facet of a complex symbol structure that would grow as the work progressed--a structure comprising three main substructures, each of which had definite substructuring of its own that was apparent. I realized that I was being rather philosophi cally introspective with all of this analysis, but I was curious as to the potential value of future augmentation means in allowing me to deal explicitly with these types of structuring. So I went ahead, keeping the groups and sub-groups of cards separated, and trying to organize and develop them.</div><br><div>I found rather quickly that the job of extracting, rearranging, editing, and copying new statements into the cards which were to represent the current set of product statements in each grouping was rather tedious. This brought me to appreciate the value of some sort of copying device with which I could transfer specified strings of words from one card to another, thus composing new statements from fragments of existing ones. This type of device should not be too hard to develop and produce for a price that a professional man could justify paying, and it would certainly facilitate some valuable symbol-structuring pro</div><br><div>I also found that there would have been great value in having available the associative-trail marking and following processes. Statements very often had implicit linkages to other statements in the same group, and it would have been very useful to keep track of these associations. For instance, when several consideration statements bore upon a given product statement, and when that product statement came to be modified through some other consideration, it was not always easy to remember why it had been establishe has it had. Being able to fish out the other considerations linked to that statement would have helped considerably.</div><br><div>Also, trial organizations of the statements in a group could be linked into trial associative trails, so that a number of such organizations could be constructed and considered without copying that many sets of specially ordered statements. Any of the previously considered organizations could be reconstructed at will.</div><br><div>In trying to do flexible structuring and restructuring within my experiment, I found that I just didn't have the means to keep track of all of the kernel statements (cards) and the various relation ships between them that were important--at least by means that were easy enough to leave time and thought capacity enough for me to keep in mind the essential nature of the memo-writing process. But it was a very provocative experience, considering the possibilities that I sensed for the flexible and powerful ways in which I could apply myself to so universal a design task if I but had the necessary means with which to manipulate symbol structures.</div><br><div>It would actually seem quite feasible to develop a unit record system around cards and mechanical sorting, with automatic trail establishment and trail-following facility, and with associated means for selective copying or data transfer, that would enable development of some very powerful methodology for everyday intellectual work. It is plain that even if the equipment (artifacts) appeared on the market tomorrow, a good deal of empirical research would be needed to develop a methodology that would capitalize upon the artifact process capabilities. New concepts need to be concelved and tested relative to the way the \"thought kernels\" could be knitted together into working structures, and relative to the conceptual presentations which become available and the symbol-manipulation processes which provide these presentations.</div><br><div>Such an approach would present useful and interesting re search problems, and could very likely produce practical and significant results (language, artifacts, methodology) for improving the effective ness of professional problem solvers. However, the technological trends of today foretell the obsolescence of such electromechanical information handling equipment. Very likely, by the time good augmentation systems could be developed, and the first groups of users began to prove them out so that they could gain more widespread acceptance, electronic data processing equipment would have evolved much further and become much more prevalent throughout the critical-problem domains of our society where such ideas would first be adopted. The relative limitations of the mechanical equipment in providing processes which could be usefully inte grated into the system would soon lead to its replacement by electronic computer equipment.</div><br><div>The next set of descriptive examples will involve the use of electronic computers, and their greatly increased flexibility and processing potential will be evident. Research based upon such electronic artifacts would be able to explore language and methodology innovations of a much wider range of sophistication than could research based upon limited and relatively inflexible electromechanical artifacts. In particular, the electronic-based experimental program could simulate the types of processes available from electromechanical artifacts, if it seemed possible (from the vantage of experience with the wide range of augmentation processes) that relatively powerful augmentation systems could be based upon their capabilities--but the relative payoffs for providing even-more-sophisticated artifact capabilities could be assessed too so that considerations of how much to invest in capital equipment versus how much increase in human effectiveness to expect could be based upon some experimental data.</div><br><div>4 A Quick Summary of Relevant Computer Technology</div><br><div>This section may be of value both to readers who are already familiar with computers, and to those who are not. A little familiarity with computer technology, enough to help considerably in understanding the augmentation possibilities discussed in thls report, can be gained by the uninitiated. For those already familiar with the technology, the following discussion can perhaps help them gain more understanding of our concepts of process and symbol structuring.</div><br><div>A computer is directly capable of performing any of a basic repertoire of very primitive symbol-manipulation processes (such as \"move the symbol in location A to location 12417,\" or \"compare the symbol in location A with that in location B, and if they are the same, set switch S to ON\"). There may be from ten to over a hundred different primitive processes which a particular machine can execute, and all of the computer's more sophisticated processes are structured from these primitive processes. It takes a repertoire of surprisingly few such primitive processes to enable the construction of any symbol-manipulation process that can be explicitly described in any language.</div><br><div>Somewhat the same situation exists relative to symbol structures i.e., there are only a very few primitive symbols with which the machine can actually work, and any new and different symbol has to be defined to the machine as a particular structure (or organization) of its primitive symbols. Actually, in every commercial digital computer, there are only two primitive symbols. Usually these are dealt with in standard-sized packets (called \"words\") of from eighteen to forty-eight primitive symbols, but arbitrary use can be made of individual primitives or of subgroups of the word.</div><br><div>To have the computer perform a non-trivial task or process, a structure of the primitive processes is organized (a computer program) and stored within the computer as a corresponding symbol structure. The computer successively examines the symbol substructure representing each primitive process in the program and executes that process--which usually alters the total internal symbol structure of the machine in some way. Lt makes no difference to the computer whether the symbols involved in the re-structuring represent part of the computer program or part of the lnformation upon which the program is operating. The ability to have the computer modify its own process structure (program) hss been a very im portant factor in the development of its power.</div><br><div>Thus, some very sophisticated techniques for process and symbol structuring have evolved in the computer field, as evidenced by the very sophisticated processes (e.g., predicting election returns, calculating orbits, translating natural languages) that can be structured to manipulate very complex structures of symbols. Among the more interesting computer-process structures that have evolved are those that can automatically develop a structure of primitive computer processes to accomplish symbol manipulation tasks that are specified on a relatively high level of abstraction. Special languages have been evolved in several fields (e.g., ALGOL and FORTRAN for scientific calculations, COBOL for business processing) that enable explicit prescription of complex manipulation processes in a rapid and concise manner by a human, thinking about the processes in a rather natural manner, so that special computer programs or process structures (called Translators, Compilers, or sometimes in a slightly different sense, Interpreters) can construct the necessary structures of primitive processes and symbols that would enable the computer to execute the prescribed processes. This development has extended immensely our capability for making use of computers--otherwise the specification of a complex process would often occupy a formidable number of man hours, and be subject to a great many errors which would be very costly to find and correct.</div><br><div>Computers have been used to simulate dynamic systems for which we humans had none but descriptive models, from which we otherwise could gain little feel for the way the system behaves. A very notable instance of this, for our consideration, has been in the area of the human thought processes. Newell, Shaw, and Simon initiated this approach) from which there has derived a number of features of interest to us. For one, they discovered that the symbol structures and the process structures required for such simulation became exceedingly complex, and the burden of organizing these was a terrific impediment to their simulation research. They devised a structurlng technique for their symbols that is basically simple but from which stem results that are very elegant. Their baslc symbol structure is what they call a 'list,\" a string of substructures that are linked serially in exactly the manner proposed by Bush for the associative trails in his Memex--i.e., each substructure contains the necessary information for locating the next substructure on the list. Here, though, each substructure could also be a list of substructures, and each of these could also, etc. Their standard manner for organizing the data which the computer was to operate upon is thus what they term \"list structuring.\"</div><br><div>They also developed special languages to descrlbe different basic processes involved in list-structure manipulation. The most widely used of their languages, IPL-V (the fifth version of their Information Processing Languages), is described in a recent book edited by Newell.(7) In these languages, both the data to be worked upon and the symbols which designate the processes to be executed upon that data are developed in list-structure form.</div><br><div>Other languages and techniques for the manipulation of list structures have been described by McCarthy,(8) by Gelernter, Hansen, and Gerberich, (9) by Yngve, (10,11) by Perlis and Thornton, (12) by Carr, (13) and by Weizenbaum.(14) The application of these techniques has been mainly of two types--one of modelling complex processes and systems (e.g., the human thought processes), where the emphasis is upon the model and its behavior, and the other of trying to get computer behavior that is intelligent whether or not the processes and behavior resemble those of a human. The languages and techniques used in both types of application promise to be of considerable value to the development of radical new augmentation systems for human problem solvers, and we shall deal later with them in more detail.</div><br><div>Computers have various means for storing symbols so that they are accessible to it for manipulation. Assuming that the human might want to have a repertoire of sixty-four basic symbols (letters, numbers, special symbols), we can discuss various forms of storage in terms of their capacity for storing these kinds of symbols (each oi which would be structured, in the computer and storage devices, as a group of six primitive computer symbols). Fast access to an arbitrary choice of a few neighboring symbols (of the human's repertoire) can be had to perhaps 100,000 such symbols within the period in which the computer can execute one of its primitive processes (from two to ten millionths of a second, depending upon the computer involved). This is the so-called high-speed, random-access working store, where space for the human's symbols might cost between sixty cents and $1.50 per symbol.</div><br><div>Cheaper, larger-capacity backup storage is usually provided by devices to which access takes considerably longer (in the computer's time reference). A continuously rotating magnetic drum can hold perhaps a million of these symbols, for which access to a random storage position may average a thirtieth of a second (waiting for the drum to come around to bring that storage position under the magnetic reading head). This is short in the human's time scale, but a reasonably fast computer could execute about 3,000 of its primitive processes during that time. Generally, information transfer between a drum and fast-access working storage takes place in blocks of data which are stored in successive positions around the drum. Such block-transfer is accomplished by a relatively small structure of primitive computer processes that cyclically executes the transfer of one word at a time until the designated block has been trans ferred. Drum storage costs about 5\u00a2 per each of the basic symbols used by the human in our example.</div><br><div>Another type of backup storage uses a number of large, thin discs (about three feet in diameter), with magnetic coating on the sur faces. The discs are stacked with enough space between each so that a moveable read-record head can be positioned radially to line up over a specific circular track of symbol storage space. A commercially available disc storage system could hold over a hundred million of the human's basic symbols, to which random access would average about a tenth of a second, and where the cost per symbol-space would be about one seventh of a cent.</div><br><div>Magnetic tapes are commonly used for backup storage, too. For these, the random access time for storage blocks are of the order of a minute or two. Here, however, the actual storage units (the tape reels) can be taken off and shelf stored, so the total storage capacity may be very large--however, the time to locate a reel and exchange reels on the tape transport adds to the above-quoted access time--and this locating and reel changing are not generally automatic processes (i.e., a human has to do them). A transport unit, connected to the computer, might cost $30,000, with tape reels at $50 each holding about five million of the human's basic symbols. For one reel, storage space for each such symbol cost about two-thirds of a cent, but for twenty full reels in a \"library\" the cost comes down to about one-thirtieth of a cent per symbol space.</div><br><div>Other types of buffer storage for computer symbol structures are becoming available, and there is considerable economic demand spurring continuing research toward storage means that give high capacity at low cost, and with as short an access time as possible. Within the next ten years there would seem to be a very high probability of significant ad vances to this end.</div><br><div>For presenting computer-stored information to the human, techniques have been developed by which a cathode-ray-tube (of which the television picture tube is a familiar example) can be made to present symbols on their screens of quite good brightness, clarity, and with considerable freedom as to the form of the symbol. Under computer control an arbitrary collection of symbols may be arranged on the screen, with considerable freedom as to relative location, size, and brightness. Similarly, line drawings, curves, and graphs may be presented, with any of the other symbols intermixed. It is possible to describe to the computer, and thereafter use, new symbols of arbitrary shape and size. On displays of this sort, a light pen (a pen-shaped tool with a flexible wire to the electronic console) can be pointed by the human at any symbol or line on the display, and the computer can automatically determine what the pen is pointing at.</div><br><div>A cathode-ray-tube display of this sort is currently limited in resolution to about 800 lines across the face of the tube (in either direction). The detail with which a symbol may be formed, and the preciseness with which the recurrent images of it may be located, are both affected by this figure so that no matter how large the screen of such a tube, the maximum number of symbols that can be put on with usable clearness remains the same.</div><br><div>The amount of usable information on such a screen, in the form of letters, numbers, and diagrams, would be limited to about what a normal human eye could make out at the normal reading distance of fourteen inches on a surface 3-1/2 inches square, or to what one could discern on an ordinary 8-1/2-by-11-inch sheet of paper at about three feet. This means that one couldnot have a single-tube display giving him an 8-1/2-by-11-inch frame to view that would have as much on it as he might be used to seeing, say on the page of a journal article.</div><br><div>The costs of such displays are now quite high--ranging from $20,000 to $60,000, depending upon the symbol repertoire, symbol-structure display capacity, and the quality of the symbol forms. One should expect these prices to be lowered quite drastically as our technology improves and the market for these displays increases.</div><br><div>Much cheaper devices can \"draw\" arbitrary symbol shapes and diagrams on paper, at a speed for symbols that is perhaps a quarter of the rate that a typewriter can produce them. Also, special typewriters (at $3,000 to $4,000 apiece) can type out information on a sheet of paper, as well as allow the human to send information to the computer via the keyboard. But these two types of devices do not allow fast and flexible rearrangement of the symbols being displayed, which proves to be an important drawback in our current view of future possibilities for augmentation.</div><br><div>For communicating to the computer, considerable freedom exists in arranging pushbuttons, switches, and keysets for use by the human. The \"interpretation\" or response to be made by the computer to the actuation of any button, switch, or key (or to any combination thereof) can be established in any manner that is describable as a structure of primitive computer processes--which means essentially any manner that is explicitly describable. The limitation on the flexibility and power of any expllcit \"shorthand\" system with which the human may wish to utilize these input devices is the human's ability to learn and to use them.</div><br><div>There are also computer-input devices that can sense enough data from handwriting to allow a computer to recognize a limited number of handwritten symbols--both as they are being written and afterwards. Means for recognizing typescript are rather well developed and are already being designed into some large documentation and language translation systems. Also, a little progress has been made toward developing equipment that can recognize a limited spoken vocabulary. There is considerable economic pressure toward developing useful and cheap devices of this type, and we can expect relatively sophisticated capabilities to become available within the next ten years. Such equipment may play an important role in the individual-augmentation systems of the future (but our feeling is that a very powerful augmentation system can be developed without them).</div><br><div>An important type of development for our consideration of providing individual humans with close-coupled computer services is what is known as time sharing. Suppose a number of individual users connect to the same computer The computer can be programmed to serve them under any of a wide variety of rules. One such could be similar to the way the telephone system gives you attention and service when you ask for it--i.e., if too many other demands are not being made for service at that time, you get instant attention; otherwise, you wait until some service capacity is free to attend to you.</div><br><div>Our view of the interaction of human and computer in the future augmented system sees a large number of relatlvely simple processes (human scale of large and simple) being performed by the computer for the human--processes which often will require only a few thousandths of a second of actual computer manipulation. Such a fast and agile helper as a computer can run around between a number of masters and seldom keep any of them waiting (at least, not long enough that they would notice it or be inconvenienced appreciably). Occasionally, of course, much larger periods of computer time will be needed by an individual, and then the other users might get their periodic milliseconds of service slipped in during these longer processes.</div><br><div>5. Other Related Thought and Work</div><br><div>When we began our search, we found a great deal of literature which put forth thought and work of general significance to our objective-- frankly, too much. Without having a conceptual framework, we could not efficiently filter out the significant kernels of fact and concept from the huge mass which we initially collected as a \"natural first step\" in our search. We feel rather unscholarly not to buttress our conceptual framework with plentiful reference to supporting work, but in truth it was too difficult to do. Developing the conceptual structure represented a sweeping synthesis job full of personal constructs from smatterings picked up in many places. Under these conditions, giving reference to a backup source would usually entail qualifying footnotes reflecting an unusual interpretation or exonerating the other author from the implications we derived from his work. We look forward to a stronger, more comprehensive, and more scholarly presentation evolving out of future work.</div><br><div>However, we do want to acknowledge thoughts and work we have come across that bear most directly upon the possibilities of using a computer in real-time working association with a human to improve his working effectiveness. These fall into two categories. The first category, which would include this report, presents speculations and possibilities but does not include reporting of significant experimental results. Of these, Bush (6) is the earliest and one of the most directly stimulating. Licklider (15) provided the most general clear case for the modern computer, and coined the expression, \"man-computer symbiosis\" to refer to the close interaction relationship between the man and computer in mutually beneficial cooperation. Ulam (16) has specifically recommended close man-computer interaction in a chapter entitled, \"synergesis,\" where he points out in considerable detail the types of mathematical work which could be aided. Good (17) includes some conjecture about possibilities of intellectual aid to the human by close cooperation with a computer in a rather general way, and also presents a few interesting thoughts about a network model for structuring the conceptual kernels of information to facilitate a sort of self-organizing retrieval system. Ramo has given a number of talks dealing with the future possibilities of computers for \"extending man's intellect,\" and wrote several articles (18,19) His projections seem slanted more toward larger bodies of humans interacting with computers, in less of an intimate personal sense than the above papers or than our initial goal. Fein (20) in making a comprehensive projection of the growth and dynamic inter-relatedness of \"computer-related sciences,\" includes specific mention of the enhancement of human intellect by cooperative activity of men, mechanisms, and automata. He coined the term \"synnoetics\" as applicable generally to the cooperative interaction of people, mechanisms, plant or animal organisms, and automata into a system whose mental power is greater than that of its components, and presented a good picture of the integrated way in which many currently separate disciplines should be developed and taught in the future to do justice to their mutual roles in the important metadiscipline defined as \"synnoetics.\"</div><br><div>In the second category, there have been a few papers published recently describing actual work that bears directly upon our topic. Licklider and Clark, (21) and Culler and Huff, (22) in the 1962 Spring Joint Computer Conference, gave what are essentially progress reports of work going on now in exactly this sort of thing--a human with a computer backed display getting minute-by-minute help in solving problems. Teager (23,24) reports on the plans and current development of a large time-sharing system at MIT, which is planned to provide direct computer access for a number of outlying stations located in scientists' offices, giving each of these users a chance for real-time utilization of the computer.</div><br><div>There are several efforts that we have heard about, but for which there are either no publications or for which none have been discovered by us. Mr. Douglas Ross, of the Electronic Systems Laboratory at MIT has, we learned by direct conversation, been thinking and working on real-time man-machine interaction problems for some years. We have recently learned that a graduate student at MIT, Glenn Randa, (25) has developed the design of a remote display console under Ross for his graduate thesis project. We understand that another graduate student there, Ivan Sutherland, is currently using the display-computer facility on the TX-2 computer at Lincoln Lab to develop cooperative techniques for engineering-design problems. And at RAND, we have learned by personal discussion that Cliff Shaw, Tom Ellis, and Keith Uncapher have been involved in implementing a multi-station time-sharing system built around their JOHNNIAC computer. Termed the JOHNNIAC Open-Shop System (JOSS for short), it apparently is near completion, and will use remote type writer stations.</div><br><div>Undoubtedly, there are efforts of others falling into either or both categories that have been overlooked. Such oversight has not been intentional, and it is hoped that these researchers will make their pertinent work known to us.</div><br><div>B. HYPOTHETICAL DESCRIPTION OF COMPUTER-BASED AUGMENTATION SYSTEM</div><br><div>Let us consider some specific possibilities for redesigning the augmentation means for an intellectually oriented, problem-solving human. We choose to present those developments of language and methodology that can capitalize upon the symbol-manipulating and portraying capabilities of computer-based equipment. The picture of the possibilities to pursue will change and grow rapidly as research gets under way, but we need to provide what pictures we can--to give substance to the generalities developed in Section II, to try to impart our feeling of rich promise, and to introduce a possible research program (Section IV).</div><br><div>Although our generalizations (about augmentation means, capability hierarchies, and mental-, concept-, symbol-, process-, and physical structuring) might retain their validity in the future--for instance, our generalized prediction that new developments in concept, symbol, and process structuring will prove to be tremendously important--the specific concepts, symbol structures, and processes that evolve will most likely differ from what we know and use now. In fact, even if we in some way could know now what would emerge after say, ten years of research, it is likely that any but a general description would be difficult to express in today's terminology.</div><br><div>1. Background</div><br><div>To try to give you (the reader) a specific sort of feel for our thesis in spite of this situation, we shall present the following picture of computer-based augmentation possibilities by describing what might happen if you were being given a personal discussion-demonstration by a friendly fellow (named Joe) who is a trained and experienced user of such an augmentation system within an experimental research program which is several years beyond our present stage. We assume that you approach this demonstration-interview with a background similar to what the previous portion of this report provides--that is, you will have heard or read a set of generalizations and a few rather primitive examples, but you will not yet have been given much of a feel for how a computer-based augmentation system can really help a person.</div><br><div>Joe understands this and explains that he will do his best to give you the valid conceptual feel that you want--trying to tread the narrow line between being too detailed and losing your over-all view anc being too general and not providing you with a solid feel for what goes on. He suggests that you sit and watch him for a while as he pursues some typical work, after which he will do some explaining. You are not particularly flattered by this, since you know that he is just going to be exercising new language and methodology developments on his new artifacts--and after all, the artifacts don't look a bit different from what you expected--so why should he keep you sitting there as if you were a complete stranger to this stuff? It will just be a matter of \"having the computer do some of his symbol-manipulating processes for him so that he can use more powerful concepts and concept-manipulation techniques,\" as you have so often been told.</div><br><div>Joe has two display screens side by side, but one of them he doesn't seem to use as much as the other. And the screens are almost horizontal, more like the surface of a drafting table than the near-vertical picture displays you had somehow imagined. But you see the reason easily, for he is working on the display surface as intently as a draftsman works on his drawings, and it would be awkward to reach out to a vertical surface for this kind of work. Some of the time Joe is using both hands on the keys, obviously feeding information into the computer at a great rate.</div><br><div>Another slight surprise, though--you see that each hand operates on a set of keys on its own side of the display frames, so that the hands are almost two feet apart. But it is plain that this arrangement allows him to remain positioned over the frames in a rather natural position, so that when he picks the light pen out of the air (which is its rest position, thanks to a system of jointed supporting arms and a controlled tension and rewind system for the attached cord) his hand is still on the way from the keyset to the display frame. When he is through with the pen at the display frame, he lets go of it, the cord rewinds, and the pen is again in position. There is thus a minimum of effort, movement, and time involved in turning to work on the frame. That is, he could easily shift back and forth from using keyset to using light pen, with either hand (one pen is positioned for each hand), without moving his head, turning, or leaning.</div><br><div>A good deal of Joe's time, though, seems to be spent with one hand on a keyset and the other using a light pen on the display surface. It is in this type of working mode that the images on the display frames changed most dynamically. You receive another real surprise as you realize how much activity there is on the face of these display tubes. You ask yourself why you weren't prepared for this, and you are forced to admit that the generalizations you had heard hadn't really sunk in--\"new methods for manipulating symbols\" had been an oft-repeated term, but it just hadn't included for you the images of the free and rapid way in which Joe could make changes in the display, and of meaningful and flexible \"shaping\" of ideas and work status which could take place so rapidly.</div><br><div>Then you realized that you couldn't make any sense at all out of the specific things he was doing, nor of the major part of what you saw on the displays. You could recognize many words, but there were a good number that were obviously special abbreviations of some sort. During the times when a given image or portion of an image remained un changed long enough for you to study it a bit, you rarely saw anything that looked llke a sentence as you were used to seeing one. You were beginning to gather that there were other symbols mixed with the words that might be part of a sentence, and that the different parts of what made a full-thought statement (your feeling about what a sentence is) were not just laid out end to end as you expected. But Joe suddenly cleared the displays and turned to you with a grin that signalled the end of the passive observation period, and also that somehow told you that he knew very well that you now knew that you had needed such a period to shake out some of your limited images and to really realize that a \"capability hierarchy\" was a rich and vital thing.</div><br><div>\"I guess you noticed that I was using unfamiliar notions, symbols, and processes to go about doing things that were even more unfamiliar to you?\" You made a non-committal nod--you saw no reason to admit to him that you hadn't even been able to tell which of the things he had been doing were to cooperate with which other things--and he continued. \"To give you a feel for what goes on, I'm going to start discussing and demonstrating some of the very basic operations and notions I've been using. You've read the stuff about process and process-capability hierarchies, I'm sure. I know from past experience in explaining radical augmentation systems to people that the new and powerful higher-level capabilities that they are interested in--because basically those are what we are all anxious to improve--can't really be explained to them without first giving them some understanding of the new and powerful capabilities upon which they are built. This holds true right on down the line to the type of low-level capability that is new and different to them all right, but that they just wouldn't ordinarily see as being 'powerful.' And yet our systems wouldn't be anywhere near as powerful without them, and a person's comprehension of the system would be rather shallow if he didn't have some understanding of these basic capabilities and of the hierarchical structure built up from them to provide the highest-level capabilities.\"</div><br><div>2. Single-Frame Composition</div><br><div>\"For explanation purposes here, let's say that the lowest level at which the computer system comes into direct play in my capability hierarchy is in the task of what I'll call 'single-frame composition.' We'll stick to working with prose text in our examples--most people can grasp easily enough what we are doing there without having to have special backgrounds in mathematics or science as they would to gain equal comprehension for some of the similar sorts of things we do with diagrams and mathematical equations. This low-level composition task is just what you normally do with a pen or pencil or typewriter on a piece of paper-- that is, assemble a bunch of symbols before your eyes in order to portray something which you have in mind.\"</div><br><div>You listened and watched as Joe showed you some of the different ways in which the composition of straightforward text was made easier for him in this system. With either hand, Joe could \"type\" (the keysets didn't look at all like typewriter keyboards) individual letters and numbers, and if he had directed it to do so, the computer would put each successive symbol next to its predecessor just as a typewriter does--only here there was completely automatic \"carriage return\" service. This didn't impress you very much, since an automatic carriage-return feature was sort of a trivial return on the investment behind all of this equipment--but then you reflected that, as long as the computer was there anyway, to help do all the flashy things you had witnessed earlier, one might as well use it in all of the little helpful ways he could.</div><br><div>But there were other ways in which help was derived for this composition task. He showed you how he could call up the dictionary definition to any word he had typed in, with but a few quick flicks on the keyset. Synonyms or antonyms could just as easily be brought forth. This also seemed sort of trivially obvious, and Joe seemed to know that you would feel so. \"It turns out that this simple capability makes it feasible to do some pretty rough tasks in the upper levels of the capability hierarchy--where precise use of special terms really pays off, where the human just couldn't be that precise by depending upon his unaided memory for definitions and 'standards,' and where using dictionary and reference-book lookup in the normal fashion would be so distracting and time-consuming that the task execution would break down. We've tried taking this feature away in some of these processes up there, and believe me, the result was a mess.</div><br><div>You could get some dim feeling for what he meant, having watched him working for a while, but you were nevertheless much relieved to find the next thing he showed you to be more directly impressive. He showed you how he could single out a group of words (called the \"object symbol string,\" or simply \"object string\") and define an abbreviation term, composed of any string of symbols he might choose, that became associated with the object string in computer storage. At any later time (until he chose to discard that particular abbreviation from his working voca bulary) the typing of the abbreviation term would call forth automatically the \"printing\" on the display of the entire object string. Joe showed you another way in which this abbreviation feature might work. He \"arranged\" for the computer to print the abbreviation on the display, just the way he typed it in. At a subsequent reading, if he had for gotten what the abbreviation stood for, he could call for substitution of the full object string to refresh his memory.</div><br><div>Then he showed you how this sort of facility had been extended, in a refined way, to provide a rather powerful sort of shorthand. He could hit a great many combinations of keys on his keyset--i.e., any one stroke of his hand could depress a number of keys, which gave him over a thousand unique single-stroke signals to the computer with either hand. Some of these signals were used as abbreviations for entire words. It seems that, for instance, the 150 most commonly used words in a natural language made up about half of any normal text in that language. Joe said that it was thus quite feasible to learn and use the single-stroke abbreviations for about half of the words he used, but beyond that each added percent began to require him to have too many abbreviations under his command. But he said that there were a lot of word endings, letter pairs (diagrams), and letter triplets (trigrams) that were so common as to make it pay to abbreviate them to a single stroke. A whole word so abbreviated saved typing all the letters as well as the spaces at either side of the word, and a word-ending abbreviated by a single stroke saved typing the letters and the end-of-word space. He claimed that he could comfortably rattle off about 180 words a minute--faster than he could comfortably talk. You believed him after he transcribed your talking for a minute or so, and it gave you an eerie feeling to see the near instantaneous appearance of your words and sentences in neat printed form.</div><br><div>Joe said that there were other miscellaneous simple features, and some quite sophisticated features to help the composition process. He made some brief references to statistical predictions that the com puter could make regarding what you were golng to type next, and that if you got reasonably skillful you could \"steer through the extrapolated prediction field\" as you entered your information and often save energy and time. You gathered that he thought you would saturate about there on this particular subject, because he went on to the next.</div><br><div>3. Single-Frame Manipulation</div><br><div>\"Even if I couldn't actually specify new symbols here any faster than with a typewriter, the extreme flexibility that this computer system provides for making changes in what is presented on the display screen would make me very much more effective in creating finished text than I could ever be on a typewriter.\" With this statement, Joe proceeded to show you what he meant. The frame full of your transcribed speech was still showing, and it represented the clumsy phrasing and illogical progression of thought so typical of extemporaneous speech. Joe took the light gun in his right hand, and with a deft flick of it, coordinated with a stroke of his left hand on its keyset, caused the silent and instantaneous deletion of a superfluous word. The word disappeared from the frame, and the rest of the text simultaneously readjusted to present the neat, no-gap, full-line appearance it had had.</div><br><div>With but slightly more motion of his light pen, he could similarly delete any string of words or letters. He demonstrated this by cutting out what I thought to be some relevant prose, and then he showed how the system allowed for second thoughts about such human-directed processes--those words were automatically saved for a brief period in case he wanted to call them back. Leaving his light pen pointed at the space where a deleted symbol string used to be, Joe could reinstate it instantaneously with one stroke of his left hand.</div><br><div>Adding one more light-pen pointing to what it took to delete an arbitrary string of symbols, Joe could direct the computer to move that string from where it was to insert it at a new point which his light pen designated. Again it would disappear instantaneously from where it had been, but now the modified display would show the old text to have been spread apart just enough at the indicated point to hold this string. The text would all still look as neat as if freshly retyped. With similar types of keyset and light-pen operations, Joe could change paragraph break points, transpose two arbitrary symbol strings (words, sentences, paragraphs, etc., or fragments thereof), readjust margins of arbitrary sections of text--essentially being able to affect immediately any of the changes that a proofreader might want to designate with his special marks, only here the proofreader is always looking at clean text as if it had been instantaneously retyped after each designation had been made.</div><br><div>Joe also demonstrated how he could request that each instance of the use of a given term be changed to a newly designated term, and this would again be instantaneously accomplished. Also, he could arbitrarily set the margins between which any section of text must appear, and its line lengths and number of lines would automatically be adjusted. He showed how this was useful in displaying parallel or counter arguments-- although he said that actual use of this feature was a bit more sophisticated--by squeezing each into half width and putting them side by side (with a vertical line suddenly separating them). One of the sections of text was about a third longer than the other--but two quick strokes with Joe's left hand caused the computer to adjust the display automatically. The middle separator line was moved toward the shorter piece of text, and the line lengths of the two sections were adjusted so that they occupied the same length along the dlsplay frame. Yes, you were beginning to get a feel for what the expression \"flexible new methods for manipulating symbol structures\" might really imply, at least on this basic-capability level.</div><br><div>4. Structuring an Argument</div><br><div>\"If we want to go on to a higher-level capability to give you a feeling for how our rebuilt capability hierarchy works, it will speed us along to look at how we might organize these more primitive capabilities which I have demonstrated into some new and better ways to set up what we can call an 'argument.' This refers loosely to any set of statements (we'll call them 'product statements') that represents the product of a period of work toward a given objective. Confused? Well, take the simple case where an argument leads to a single product statement. For instance, you come to a particular point in your work where you have to decide what to do for the next step. You go through some reasoning process--usually involving statements--and come up with a statement specifying that next step. That final statement is the product statement, and it represents the product of the argument or reasoning process which led to it.</div><br><div>\"You usually think of an argument as a serial sequence of steps of reason, beginning with known facts, assumptions, etc., and progressing toward a conclusion. Well, we do have to think through these steps serially, and we usually do list the steps serially when we write them out because that is pretty much the way our papers and books have to present them--they are pretty limiting in the symbol structuring they enable us to use. Have you even seen a 'scrambled-text' programmed instruction book? That is an interesting example of a deviation from straight serial presentation of steps.</div><br><div>\"Conceptually speaking, however, an argument is not a serial affair. It is sequential, I grant you, because some statements have to follow others, but this doesn't imply that its nature is necessarily serial. We usually string Statement B after Statement A, with Statements C, D, E, F, and so on following in that order--this is a serial structuring of our symbols. Perhaps each statement logically followed from all those which preceded it on the serial list, and if so, then the conceptual structuring would also be serial in nature, and it would be nicely matched for us by the symbol structuring.</div><br><div>\"But a more typical case might find A to be an independent statement, B dependent upon A, C and D independent, E depending upon D and B, E dependent upon C, and F dependent upon A, D, and E. See, sequential but not serial? A conceptual network but not a conceptual chain. The old paper and pencil methods of manipulating symbols just weren't very adaptable to making and using symbol structures to match the ways we make and use conceptual structures. With the new symbol-manipulating methods here, we have terrific flexibility for matching the two, and boy, it really pays off in the way you can tie into your work.</div><br><div>This makes you recall dimly the generalizations you had heard previously about process structuring limiting symbol structuring, symbol structuring limiting concept structuring, and concept structuring limiting mental structuring. You nod cautiously, in hopes that he will proceed in some way that will tie this kind of talk to something from which you can get the \"feel\" of what it is all about. As it turns out, that is just what he intends to do.</div><br><div>\"Let's actually work some examples. You help me.\" And you become involved in a truly fascinating game. Joe tells you that you are to develop an argument leading to statements summarizing the augmentation means so far revealed to you for doing the kind of straight-text work usually done with a pencil and eraser on a single sheet of paper. You unconsciously look for a scratch pad before you realize that he is telling you that you are going to do this the \"augmented way\" by using him and his system--with artful coaching from him. Under a bit of urging from him, you begin self-consciously to mumble some inane statements about what you have seen, what they imply, what your doubts and reservations are, etc. He mercilessly ignores your obvious discomfort and gives you no cue to stop, until he drops his hands to his lap after he has filled five frames with these statements (the surplus filled frames disappeared to somewhere--you assume Joe knows where they went and how to get them back).</div><br><div>\"You notice how you wandered down different short paths, and criss-crossed yourself a few times?\" You nod--depressed, no defense. But he isn't needling you. \"Very natural development, just the way we humans always seem to start out on a task for which we aren't all primed with knowledge, method, experience, and confidence--which is to include essentially every problem of any consequence to us. So let's see how we can accommodate the human's way of developing his comprehension and his final problem solution.</div><br><div>\"Perhaps I should have stopped sooner--I am supposed to be coaching you instead of teasing you--but I had a reason. You haven't been making use of the simple symbol-manipulation means that I showed you--other than the shorthand for getting the stuff on the screens. You started out pretty much the way you might with your typewriter or pencil. I'll show you how you could have been doing otherwise, but I want you to notice first how hard it is for a person to realize how really unques tioning he is about the way he does things. Somehow we implicitly view most all of our methods as just sort of 'the way things are done, that's all.' You knew that some exotic techniques were going to be applied, and you'll have to admit that you were passively waiting for them to be handed to you.\"</div><br><div>With a non-committal nod, you suggest getting on with it. Joe begins, \"You're probably waiting for something impressive. What I'm trying to prime you for, though, is the realization that the impressive new tricks all are based upon lots of changes in the little things you do. This computerized system is used over and over and over again to help me do little things--where my methods and ways of handling little things are changed until, lo, they've added up and suddenly I can do impressive new things.\"</div><br><div>You don't know. He's a nice enough guy, but he sure gets preachy. But the good side of your character shows through, and you realize that everything so far has been about little things--this is probably an important point. You'll stick with him. Okay, so what could you have been doing to use the simple tricks he had shown you in a useful way? Joe picks up the light pen, poises his other hand over the keyset, and looks at you. You didn't need the hint, but thanks anyway, and let's start rearranging and cleaning up the work space instead of just dumping more raw material on it.</div><br><div>With closer coaching now from Joe, you start through the list of statements you've made and begin to edit, re-word, compile, and delete. It's fun--\"put that sentence back up here between these two\"--and blink, it's done. \"Group these four statements, indented two spaces, under the heading \"shorthand,\" and blink, it's done. \"Insert what I say next there, after that sentence.\" You dictate a sentence to extend a thought that is developing, and Joe effortlessly converts it into an inserted new sentence. Your ideas begin to take shape, and you can continually re-work the existing set of statements to keep representing the state of your \"concept structure.\"</div><br><div>You are quite elated by this freedom to juggle the record of your thoughts, and by the way this freedom allows you to work them into shape. You reflected that this flexible cut-and-try process really did appear to match the way you seemed to develop your thoughts. Golly, you could be writing math expressions, ad copy, or a poem, with the same type of benefit. You were ready to tell Joe that now you saw what he had been trying to tell you about matching symbol structuring to concept structuring--when he moved on to show you a succession of other tech niques that made you realize you hadn't yet gotten the full significance of his pitch.</div><br><div>So far the structure that you have built with your symbols looks just like what you might build with pencil-and-paper techniques-- only here the building is so much easier when you can trim, extend, insert, and rearrange so freely and rapidly. But the same computer here that gives us these freedoms with so trivial an application of its power, can just as easily give us other simple capabilities which we can apply to the development and use of different types of structure from what we used to use. But let me unfold these little computer tricks as we come to them.</div><br><div>\"When you look at a given statement in the middle of your argument structure, there are a number of things you want to know. Let's simplify the sltuation by saying that you might ask three questions, 'What's this?', 'How come?', and 'So what?' Let's take these questions one at a time and see how some changes in structuring might help a per son answer them better.</div><br><div>You look at a statement and you want to understand its meaning. You are used to seeing a statement portrayed in just the manner you might hear it--as a serial succession of words. But, just as with the statements within an argument, the conceptual relationship among the words of a sentence is not generally serial, and we can benefit in matching better to the conceptual structure if we can conveniently work with cer tain non-serial symbol-structuring forms within sentences.</div><br><div>\"Most of the structuring forms I'll show you stem from the simple capability of being able to establish arbitrary linkages between different substructures, and of directing the computer subsequently to display a set of linked substructures with any relative positioning we might designate among the different substructures. You can designate as many different kinds of links as you wish, so that you can specify different display or manipulative treatment for the different types.\"</div><br><div>Joe picked out one of your sentences, and pushed the rest of the text a few lines up and down from it to isolate it. He then showed you how he could make a few strokes on the keyset to designate the type of link he wanted established, and pick the two symbol structures that were to be linked by means of the light pen. He said that most links possessed a direction, i.e., they were like an arrow pointing from one substructure to another, so that in setting up a link he must specify the two substructures in a given order.</div><br><div>He went to work for a moment, rapidly setting up links within your sentence. Then he showed you how you could get some help in looking at a statement and understanding it. \"Here is one standard portrayal, for which I have established a computer process to do the structuring automatically on the basis of the interword links.\" A few strokes on the keyset and suddenly the sentence fell to pieces--different parts of it being positioned here and there, with some lines connecting them. \"Remember diagramming sentences when you were studying grammar? Some good methods, plus a bit of practice, and you'd be surprised how much a diagrammatic breakdown can help you to scan a complex statement and untangle it quickly.</div><br><div>\"We have developed quite a few more little schemes to help at the statement level. I don't want to tangle you up with too much detail, though. You can see, probably, that quick dictionary-lookup helps.\" He aimed at a term with the light pen and hit a few strokes on the keyset, and the old text jumped farther out of the way and the definition appeared above the diagram, with the defined term brighter than the rest of the diagram. And he showed you also how you could link secondary phrases (or sentences) to parts of the statement for more detailed description. These secondary substructures wouldn't appear when you normally viewed the statement, but could be brought in by simple request if you wanted closer study.</div><br><div>\"It proves to be terrifically useful to be able to work easily with statements that represent more sophisticated and complex concepts. Sort of like being able to use structural members that are lighter and stronger--it gives you new freedom in building structures. But let's move on--we'll come back to this area later, if we have time.</div><br><div>\"When you look at a statement and ask, 'How come?', you are used to scanning back over a serial array of previously made statements in search of an understanding of the basis upon which this statement was made. But some of these previous statements are much more significant than others to this search for understanding. Let us use what we call 'antecedent links' to point to these, and I'll give you a basic idea of how we structure an argument so that we can quickly track down the essential basis upon which a given statement rests.\"</div><br><div>You helped him pick out the primary antecedents of the statement you had been studying, and he established links to them. These statements were scattered back through the serial list of statements that you had assembled, and Joe showed you how you could either brighten or underline them to make them stand out to your eye--just by requesting the computer to do this for all direct antecedents of the designated statement. He told you, though, that you soon get so you aren't very much interested in seeing the serial listing of all of the statements, and he made another request of the computer (via the keyset) that eliminated all the prior statements, except the direct antecedents, from the screen. The subject statement went to the bottom of the frame, and the antecedent statements were neatly listed above it.</div><br><div>Joe then had you designate an order of \"importance to comprehension\" among these statements, and he rearranged them accordingly as fast as you could choose them. (This choosing was remarkably helped by having only the remainder statements to study for each new choice--another little contribution to effectiveness, you thought.) He mentioned that you could designate orderings under several different criteria, and later have the display show whichever ordering you wished. This, he implied, could be used very effectively when you were building or studying an argument structure in which from time to time you wanted to strengthen your comprehension relative to different aspects of the situation.</div><br><div>\"Each primary antecedent can similarly be linked to its primary antecedents, and so on, until you arrive at the statements representing the premises, the accepted facts, and the objectives upon which this argument had been established. When we had established the antecedent links for all the statements in the argument, the question 'So what?' that you might ask when looking at a given statement would be answered by looking for the statements for which the given statement was an antecedent. We already have links to these consequents--just turn around the arrows on the antecedent links and we have consequent links. So we can easily call forth an uncluttered display of consequent statements to help us see why we needed this given statement in the argument.</div><br><div>\"To help us get better comprehension of the structure of an argument, we can also call forth a schematic or graphical display. Once the antecedent-consequent links have been established, the computer can automatically construct such a display for us.\" So, Joe spent a few minutes (with your help) establishing a reasonable set of links among the statements you had originally listed. Then another keyed-in request to the computer, and almost instantaneously there appeared a network of lines and dots that looked something like a tree--except that sometimes branches would fuse together. \"Each node or dot represents one of the statements of your argument, and the lines are antecedent-consequent links. The antecedents of one statement always lie above that statement-- or rather, their nodes lie above its node. When you get used to using a network representation like this, it really becomes a great help in getting the feel for the way all the different ideas and reasoning fit together-- that is, for the conceptual structuring.\"</div><br><div>Joe demonstrated some ways in which you could make use of the diagram to study the argument structure. Point to any node, give a couple of strokes on the keyset, and the corresponding statement would appear on the other screen--and that node would become brighter. Call the antecedents forth on the second screen, and select one of special interest--deleting the others. Follow back down the antecedent trail a little further, using one screen to look at the detail at any time, and the other to show you the larger view, with automatic node-brightening indication of where these detailed items fit in the larger view.</div><br><div>\"For a little embellishment here, and to show off another little capability in my repertoire, let me label the nodes so that you can develop more association between the nodes and the statements in the argument. I can do this several ways. For one thing, I can tell the computer to number the statements in the order in which you originally had them listed, and have the labelling done automatically.\" This took him a total of five strokes on the keyset, and suddenly each node was made into a circle with a number in it. The statements that were on the second screen now each had its respective serial number sitting next to it in the left margin. \"This helps you remember what the different nodes on the network display contain. We have also evolved some handy techniques for constructing abbreviation labels that help your memory quite a bit.</div><br><div>\"Also, we can display extra fine-structure and labelling detail within the network in the specific local area we happen to be concentrating upon. This finer detail is washed out as we move to another spot with our close attention, and the coarser remaining structure is compressed, so that there is room for our new spot to be blown up. It is a lot like using zones of variable magnification as you scan the structure--higher magnification where you are inspecting detail, lower magnification in the surrounding field so that your feel for the whole structure and where you are in it can stay with you.\"</div><br><div>5. General Symbol Structuring</div><br><div>\"If you are tangling with a problem of any size--whether it involves you for half an hour or two years--the entire collection of statements, sketches, computations, literature sources, and source extracts that is associated with your work would in our minds constitute a single symbol structure. There may be many levels of substructuring between the level of individual symbols and that represented by the entire collection. You and I have been worxing with some of the lower-ordered substructures--the individual statements and the multistatement argu ments--and have skimmed through some of the ways to build and manipulate them. The results of small arguments are usually integrated in a higher level network of argument or concept development, and these into still higher-level networks, and so on. But at any such level, the manner in which the interrelationship between the kernels of argument can be tagged, portrayed, studied and manipulated is much the same as those which we have just been through.</div><br><div>\"Substructures that might represent mathematical or formal-logic arguments may be linked right in with substructures composed of the more informal statements. Substructures that represent graphs, curves, engineering drawings, and other graphical forms can likewise be integrated. One can also append special substructures, of any size, to particular other substructures. A frequent use of this is to append descriptive material--something like footnotes, only much more flexible. Or, special messages can be hung on that offer ideas such as simplifying an argument or circumventing a blocked path--to be uncovered and considered at some later date. These different appended substructures can remain invisible to the worker until such time as he wants to flush them into view. He can ask for the cue symbols that indicate their presence (identifying where they are linked and what their respective types are) to be shown on the network display any time he wishes, and then call up whichever of them he wishes If he is interested in only one type of appended substructure, he can request that only the cues associated with that type be displayed.</div><br><div>\"You should also realize that a substructure doesn't have to be a hunk of data sitting neatly distinct within the normal form of the larger structure. One can choose from a symbol structure (or substructure, generally) any arbitrary collection of its substructures, designate any arbitrary structuring among these and any new substructures he wants to add, and thus define a new substructure which the computer can untangle from the larger structure and present to him at any time. The associative trails that Bush suggested represent a primitive example of this. A good deal of this type of activity is involved during the early, shifting development of some phase of work, as you saw when you were collecting tentative argument chains. But here again, we find ever more delightful ways to make use of the straightforward-seeming capabilities in developing new higher-level capabilities--which, of course, seem sort of straight forward by then, too.</div><br><div>\"I found, when I learned to work with the structures and manipulation processes such as we have outlined, that I got rather impatient if I had to go back to dealing with the serial-statement structuring in books and journals, or other ordinary means of communicating with other workers. It is rather like having to project three-dimensional images onto two-dimensional frames and to work with them there instead of in their natural form. Actually, it is much closer to the truth to say that it is like trying to project n-dimensional forms (the concept structures, which we have seen can be related with many many nonintersecting links) onto a one-dimensional form (the serial string of symbols), where the human memory and visualization has to hold and picture the links and relationships. I guess that's a natural feeling, though. One gets impatlent any tlme he is forced into a restrlcted or primitive mode of operation--except perhaps for recreatlonal purposes.</div><br><div>\"I'm sure that you've had the experience of working over a journal article to get comprehension and perhaps some special-purpose conclusions that you can integrate into your own work. Well, when you ever get handy at roaming over the type of symbol structure which we have been showing here, and you turn for this purpose to another person's work that is structured in this way, you will find a terrific difference there in the ease of gaining comprehension as to what he has done and why he has done it, and of isolating what you want to use and making sure of the conditions under which you can use it. This is true even if you find his structure left in the condition in which he has been working on it--that is, with no special provisions for helping an outsider find his way around. But we have learned quite a few simple tricks for leaving appended road signs, supplementary information, questions, and auxiliary links on our working structures--in such a manner that they never get in our way as we work--so that the visitor to our structure can gain his comprehension and isolate what he wants in marvelously short order. Some of these techniques are quite closely related to those used in automated-instruction programming--perhaps you know about 'teaching machines?'</div><br><div>\"What we found ourselves doing, when having to do any extensive digesting of journal articles, was to type large batches of the text verbatim into computer store. It is so nice to be able to tear it apart, establish our own definitions and substitute, restructure, append notes, and so forth, in pursuit of comprehension, that it was generally well worth the trouble. The keyset shorthand made this reasonably practical. But the project now has an optical character reader that will convert our external references into machine code for us. The references are available for study in original serial form on our screens, but any structuring and tagging done by a previous reader, or ourselves, can also be utilized.</div><br><div>\"A number of us here are uslng the augmented systems for our project research, and we find that after a few passes through a reference, we very rarely go back to it in its original form. It sits in the archives like an orange rind, with most of the real juice squeezed out. The contributions from these references form sturdy members of our structure, and are duly tagged as to source so that acknowledgment is always implicitly noted. The analysis and digestion that any of us makes on such a reference is fully available to the others. It is rather amazing how much superfluous verbiage is contained in those papers merely to try to make up for the pitifully sparse possibilities available for symbol structuring in printed text.\"</div><br><div>6. Process Structuring</div><br><div>There was a slight pause while Joe apparently was reflecting upon something. He started to speak, thought differently of it, and turned to flash something on a screen. You looked quickly, anticipating that now you would comprehend. Well, more of the display looked meaningful to you than when you had first watched him going about his work, but you realized that you were still a bit uneducated. I've developed a sequence for presenting the different basic features of our augmentation system that seems to work pretty well, and I just wanted to be sure I was still following it reasonably closely.\"</div><br><div>He noticed you wrinkle your face as you looked at the display. \"It's time to shift the topic a bit, and some of the things on the screen that are probably puzzling you can make a starting point for a new discussion phase. See, when I outlined a delivery for giving a feel for these techniques to the uninitiated, I could have sketched out the subject matter in a skeletal argument structure. From what we've been through so far, you might expect it to be like that. What I did, though, was to treat the matter as a process that I was going to execute the process of giving you a lecture demonstration. It is a rather trivial exercise of the techniques we have for developing and manipulating processes, but anyway that's the form I chose for making the notes.</div><br><div>\"A process is something that is designed, built, and used--as is any tool. In the general sense in which we consider processes to be a part of our augmentation system, it is absolutely necessary that there be effective capability for designing and building processes as well as for using them. For one thing, the laying out of objectives and a method of approach for a problem represent a form of process design and building, to our way of looking at it. And an independent problem solver certainly has to have this capability. Indeed, we find that designing and coordinating one's sequence of steps, in high levels or in low levels of such process structuring, is an extremely important part of the total activity.</div><br><div>\"One of our research guys in the early phases of our augmentation development was considered (then) to be a bug on this topic. He maintained that about ten percent of the little steps we took all day accounted for ninety percent of the progress toward the goals we claimed to pursue--that is, that ninety percent of our actions and thoughts were coupled to our net progress in only a very feeble way. Well, we can't analyze the old ways of doing things very accurately to check his estimated figures, but we certainly have come to be in general sympathy with his stand. We have developed quite a few concepts and methods for using the computer system to help us plan and supervise sophisticated courses of action, to monitor and evaluate what we do, and to use this information as direct feedback for modifying our planning techniques in the future.</div><br><div>\"There are, of course, the explicit computer processes which we use, and which our philosophy requires the augmented man to be able to design and build for himself. A number of people, outside our research group here, maintain stoutly that a practical augmentation system should not require the human to have to do any computer programming--they feel that this is too specialized a capability to burden people with. Well, what that means in our eyes, if translated to a home workshop, would be like saying that you can't require the operating human to know how to adjust his tools, or set up jigs, or change drill sizes, and the like. You can see there that these skllls are easy to learn in the context of what the human has to learn anyway about using the tools, and that they provide for much greater flexibility in finding convenient ways to use the tools to help shape materials.</div><br><div>\"It won't take too much time to give you a feel for the helpf methods we have for working on computer-process structures -- or programs -- because there is quite a bit of similarity in concept to what you have seen in the symbol-structuring techniques. No matter what language you use -- whether machine language, list language, or ALGOL, for instance--you build up the required process structure by organizing statements in that language. Each statement specifies a given process to your computer. Well, you have already seen how you can get help in developing precise and powerful statements, or in gaining quick comprehension of state ments, by charting or diagramming them and using special links between the different parts. \"Look here.'\" And he went after what he said was a typical process structure, to give you an exa*ple of what he was talking about. In several brief, successive frame displays, before he got to the one he wanted, you got glimpses of network schematics that reminded you of those used in symbol structuring. But, what he finally had on the display frame was quite different from the argument statements you had seen.</div><br><div>\"In explaining symbol-structuring to you, I used the likely questions, 'What's this?' 'How come?' and 'So what?' to point out the usefulness of some of our structuring methods. Here, in process structuring, corresponding questions about a statement might be: 'What does it say to do?' 'What effect will that have?' and 'Why do we want that done?' Let's take a quick look at some of the ways you can get help in answering them.</div><br><div>\"The language used to compose these process-description stateme for the computer is considerably more compact and precise than is a natural language, such as English, and there is correspondingly less advantage to be gained by appending special links and tags for giving us humans a better grasp of their meaning. However, as you see in this left-hand section of the statement portrayal, geometrical grouping, linking, and positioning of the statement components are used in the blown-up statement display. But this portrayal doesn't stem from special appended information, it can be laid out like this automatically by the computer, just from the cues it gets from the necessary symbol components of the statement. The different significant relationships are more perceptible to a human in this way of laying it out, and an experienced human thus gets quite a bit of help in answering the first question: 'What does it say to do?'</div><br><div>For the second question, relative to what effect the specified action will have, some of these symbols to the right give you a quick story about the very detailed and immediate effect on the state of the symbol structure which this process structure is manipulating. Other symbols here provide keys which a light-pen selection can activate to bring to you displays of that symbol structure, usually a choice of several relevant views at different levels of the structure. Then I can use the keyset to ask for the preceding statement, if I'm a little puzzled about the detailed manipulation--or, I can request a specific higher-level view of the process structure by light-pen selection on one of these remaining symbols here.</div><br><div>So saying, Joe selected one of these symbols with his pen, and a new and different display popped into view. \"This is the next level up in the process structure. It consists of lists of compactly abbreviated statements, and some condensed notes about their effects. If we want, we can blow up one at a time as we study over the list. In this context, one can get some answer to the larger picture of what effect will a given statement have, and also some answer to the question about why we want a given effect produced. But this is a sort of a holdover from old pro gramming habits, and most of us nowadays are making considerably more use of the schematic techniques that evolved out of the program flow-charting techniques and out of our symbol-structuring techniques.</div><br><div>\"I know that you have less prevlous familiarity with the nature of programs than you do wlth the nature of arguments, so I'll just give you a few quick views of what these process-structure schematic portrayals look like, and not try to explain them in any detail. He flashed a few on the screen, and indicated how some of the different features could give the human a quick appreclation of how different component processes were cooperating to produce a more sophisticated process. You could appreciate some of the tricks of linking in explanatory and descriptive substructure and the general means of using all the different symbol-structuring tricks for representing to the human the considerations, critical features, and lnterdependencies involved in the process structure.</div><br><div>\"Most of this portrayal technique actually represents special structuring of what we previously defined in a loose way as arguments. The human who wants to approach an established process structure in order to modify it, needs to gain comprehension of the relevant features both of the functioning and of the design of the structure. You saw how this could be facilitated by our symbol-structuring techniques. And if he is building a new process structure or changing an existing one, he needs to structure the argument or reasoning behind the design. We have developed a number of special symbol-structuring techniques that allow us to match especially well to the concepts involved in designing processes.</div><br><div>\"But there is a very significant feature involved in this particular type of process structuring that I should tell you about. It is based upon the fact that the process-description language for the computer is formal and precise. Because of this fact, we can establish explicit rules for treating statements in this language, and for treating symbol structures composed of these statements, such that computer pro cesses based upon these rules can be said to extract meaning from these statements and to do operations based upon this meaning. The result is that the computer is able to find answers to a much wider range of questions about a specified process structure than it could if only the structural characteristics were discernible to it.</div><br><div>\"In our studying and designing process structures, we have found many ways to capitalize upon this more sophisticated question-answering capability now possessed by the computer. We are learning, for instance, how to get the computer to decide whether or not some types of design specificatlons are met, and if not, where the limitation exists. Or, perhaps we approach an already designed process structure which we think we can modify, or from which we can extract some useful sub-process that we contemplate incorporating into another process we are designing. We are getting terrific help in this type of instance, since we can now ask the computer direct questions about types of capability and limitation in this structure. The computer can even lead us directly to the particular design features from which these capabilities or limitations stem, and it is simple then to examine the descriptive and explanatory arguments linked thereto in order to see why these features were designed into the structure.</div><br><div>\"But I don't want to spend a disproportionate amount of time on the computer processes. The augmented man is engaged more often in structuring what we call composite processes than he is in structuring computer processes. For instance, planning a research project, or a day's work, are examples of structuring composite processes. A composite process, remember, is organized from both human processes and computer processes--which includes, of course, the possible inclusion of lower-order composite processes. The structuring here differs from that of a computer process mainly in the sophistication of the sub-processes which can be specified for the human to do. Some of these specifications have to be given in a language which matches the human's rich working framework of concepts--and we have been demonstrating here with English for that purpose--but quite a few human-executed processes can be specified in the high-level computer-processing language even though we don't know how to describe them in that language. This means that there few composite-process structures about which the computer can answer very useful questions for us.</div><br><div>\"But to be more specific--we find that setting up objectives, deslgning a method of approach, and then implementing that method are of course our fundamental operating sequence--done over and over again in the manY levels of our activitY. We mentioned above what the characteristic structural difference was between computer processes and composite processes. But perhaps more important to us is the difference in the way we work with composite-process structures. Here is a crude but succinct way to put this. With the human contributing to a process, we find more and more as the process becomes complex that the value of the human's contribution depends upon how much freedom he is given to be disorderly in his course of action. For instance, we provide him as much help as possible in making a plan of action. Then we give him as much help as we can in carrying it out. But we also have to allow him to change his mind at almost any point, and to want to modify his plans. So, we provide augmentation help to him for keeping track of his plans where he is in them, what has been happening in carrying them out to date--and for evaluating possibilities that might occur to him for changing the plans. In fact, we are even learning how the computer can be made to watch for some kinds of plan-change possibilities, and to point them out to the human when they arise.</div><br><div>\"Here's a simple example of this sort of help for the human. Last winter, we designed a computer process that can automatically monitor the occurrence of specified types of computer usage over a specified period of time, and which, from the resulting data, can deduce a surprising amount of information regarding how the human made use of that time. This was quite helpful to us for evaluating our ways of doing things. Then we added more features to the program, in which the computer occasionally interrupts the human's activity and displays some questions to be answered. From these answers, together with its normal monitoring data, the program can provide evaluative data regarding the relative success of his different work methods. Our augmentation researchers became intrigued by this angle and bore down a little on it. They came up with a package process which gives the human many different types of feedback about his progress and way of doing things. Now, as part of my regular practice, I spend about five minutes out of each hour exercising with this package. This almost always reveals things to me that change at least the slant of my approach during the next hour, and often stimulates a relatlvely significant change in my short-range plans</div><br><div>\"You appreciate, of course, that I accomplish many more meaningful steps in an hour now than I used to, or than would be your norm now. This once-an-hour review for me now might compare with a once-a-day review for you, as far as the distance travelled between reviews is concerned.</div><br><div>\"Our way of structuring the statement of our objectives, the arguments which lead to the design of our plans, and the working statements of our plans, has been influenced by this review process. We found special types of tags and descriptive codes which we could append to these respective planning structures as we developed them which later facilitated our man-computer cooperative review of them. Also, our methods of developing these structures have evolved to facilitate their later modification. For instance, every basic consideration upon which a given planning statement is based is linked to that statement as a matter of standard argument structuring. But we have taken to linking special tagging codes into these argument structures involving our planning, to identify for the computer some of the different types of dependency relationships in the antecedent linkages. Later, if we consider changing the plan, these special tags often enable us to make use of some special computer processes that automatically isolate the considerations relevant to a particular type of change we have in mind.</div><br><div>\"Maybe an example will help here. There is a plan I am currently using for the way I go about entering miscellaneous scraps of infcrmation lnto my total symbol structure. It is designed so that there will be a good chance for these scraps later to be usefully integrated. It turns out that this plan is closely coupled in its design argument to the general plan for reviewing process structures--and symbol-structures, too, for that matter. Recently, I got an idea as to how I might add a little feature to that process that specially suited my particular way of wanting to deal with miscellaneous thoughts that I get. By various means, I very quickly learned that this would be easy to do if I could but reverse the order ln whlch I execute the sub-process Steps A and B, when I enter a piece of lnformation. I had to find out if I could safely reverse their order without getting into trouble someplace in my system.</div><br><div>\"This I could do relatively rapidly, by your standards, by snooping down the antecedent trails, looking for statements relevant to this timing question. There is, in fact, a semi-automatic processes available to me for speeding just such searches. The computer keeps track of where I have looked, where I've marked things as yes, or no, or possible, and does the bookkeeping and calculating necessary to guide me through an optimum search strategy. But the special tagging we do when we make a process structure lets this search be fully automatic when certain kinds of relationships are involved--and relative timing happens to be one of these relationships.</div><br><div>\"So I phrased a question which essentially asked for considerations relevant to the order in which these two steps were executed, and turned the computer loose. It took about three seconds for the results to be forthcoming--you haven't yet seen me request a task that took a noticeable period of machine time, have you? But anyway, the computer discovered a relevance trail that ended up showing that reversing the order of Steps A and B during the information-scrap entry process would cripple a certain feature in the planning-review process, where miscellaneous thoughts and possibilities are gleaned from this store to be considered relative to the planning.</div><br><div>\"But let's try to back away from details for a bit, now, and see if we can get a feeling for the significance of the things we've been talking about. Comparison with other working domains would be helpful, perhaps. If you were an inventor of useful mechanisms, you would like to have a wide range of materials-processing and shaping techniques available to you. This would give you more freedom and more interesting possibilities in the way you worked and designed. But many of these techniques are very specialized; they require special equipment, special skills to execute the processing and shaping, and special knowledge about applicability and possibillties for the techniques.</div><br><div>\"Suppose you were told that you could subscribe to a community- owned installation of special equipment--containing all sorts of wonderful instruments tools and machines for measuring and processing with such as chemical, optical, mechanical, electronic, pneumatic, vacuum, metallurgy, and human factors. But this wasn't all that was included in the subscription. There would be a specialist assigned to you, instantly available for consultation and help whenever you requested it. He wouldn't have high-level theoretical trainlng. His specialty would be familiarity with the special manuals compiled from what the theoreticians, equipment builders, and technicians know, and being able to pinpoint relevant data and apply complex rules and specifications.</div><br><div>\"A lot of questions you might ask he couldn't answer directly, but in such a case he could often lead you quickly to some relevant pages in his books. You discovered that usually a succession of well-chosen questions of the sort he could answer, interspersed with your occasional study of succinct and relevant material he'd dig up for you, could very rapidly develop answers to conceptually sophisticated questions. His help in your minute-by-minute designing work could be extremely valuable-- availing you of quick and realistic consideration of a great many new design possibilities.</div><br><div>\"Similarly, when it came to carrying out a planned set of operations, it turned out that he couldn't carry out all of the processes for you--he could manage complex rules and procedures beautifully, but he would break down when it came to steps that required what you might call a larger view of the situation. But this wasn't so bad. The set of routine processes which he could manage all alone still provided you with a great deal of help--in fact, you got to developing ways to build things so as to capitalize upon his efficiency at these tasks. Then the processes which were too much for him would be done by the two of you together. He filled in all the routine stuff and you took care of the steps that were beyond his capability Often the steps you had to take care of were buried in the middle of a complex routine whose over-all nature didn't have to be understood by either of you for proper execution. Your helper would keep track of the complex procedure and execute all the steps he could. When he came to a step that was too big for him, he would hand you enough information to allow you to take that step, whereupon he would take over again until he met another such step.</div><br><div>\"As an inventor and bullder of devices that solve needs, you could become a great deal more versatile and productive, applying your imagination, intuition, judgment, and intelligence very effectively over a much wider range of possibilities. You could tackle much more complex and sophisticated projects, you could come up with very much better results--neater, cheaper, more reliable, more versatile, higher-quality performance--and you could work faster. Your effectiveness in this domain of activity would be considerably increased.</div><br><div>\"So let's turn back to the working domain which we are considering here. It is an intellectual one, where the processing and shaping done is of conceptual material rather than physical material. But between these two types of working domains we nonetheless find closely analogous conditions relative to the variety and sophistication of the processes and techniques applicable to what nonroutine workers do. Consider the intellectual domain of a creative problem solver, and listen to me rattle off the names of some specialized disciplines that come to mind. These esoteric disciplines could very possibly contribute specialized processes and techniques to a general worker in the intellectual domain: Formal logic--mathematics of many varieties, including statistics-- decision theory--game theory--time and motion analysis--operations research--classification theory--documentation theory--cost accounting, for time, energy, or money--dynamic programming--computer programming. These are only a few of the total, I'm sure.</div><br><div>\"This implies the range of potentially applicable processes. Realize that there is also a correspondingly large list of specialized materials potentially usable in the fabrications of the intellectual worker. I speak, of course, about the conceptual material in the many different flelds of human interest. The things that I have been de monstrating to you this afternoon were designed to increase significantly the range of both processes and materials over which a human can practically operate within this intellectual domain. You might say that we do this by providing him with a very fast, agile vehicle, equipped with all sorts of high-performance sensory equipment and navigational aids, and carrying very flexible, powerful, semi-automatic devices for operating upon the materials of this domain. Not only that, but to provide an accurate analogy, we have to give him a computer to help him organize and monitor his activity and assess his results. We get direct help on many levels of activity in our system, you see.</div><br><div>\"But back to the topic of tools, and the analogy of the inventor who was given the equipment and the helper. Our augmented intellectual worker gets essentially this same kind of service, only more so--a compounding of this kind of service. Structuring our processes with care and precision enables the computer to answer limited questions, to guide you to relevant descriptions and specifications within its structure, to execute complex but limited-grasp processes on its own, and to take care of complex rule and procedure-following bookkeeping in guiding the execution of sophisticated composite processes. This actually makes it practical to use many specialized processes and techniques from very esoteric fields--to assess their applicability and limitations quickly, to incorporate them intelligently into the design and analysis of possible courses of action, and to execute them efficiently.</div><br><div>\"Our specialized processes represent a beautiful collection of special tools. These tools are designed by specialists, and they come equipped with operating instructions, trouble-shooting hints, and complete design data. Furthermore, we are provided with other tools that help us determine the applicability of these tools by automatically operating upon the instruction manual for us. Further, if something goes wrong with one of these tools, if we want to design a new tool of our own and make use of one of its modular components, or if we want to rearrange some of its adjustable features, we get considerable help in learning what we have to know about its design, and in making adjustments or coupling a part of it to another tool. Our shop contains an efficient tool-making section, where we can design and build our own tools from scratch, or by incorporating parts or all of any other tools we have.</div><br><div>\"Let me tell you of an interesting feature stemming from my using such improved Process-structuring techniques. An effective job of breaking down a complex problem into humanly manageable steps--and this is essentially what we seek in our process structuring--will provide the human with something to do at every turn. This may be to ponder or go searching, true enough--we aren't saying that the steps are necessarily straightforward. But the point I want to make is that no longer am I ever at a loss as to what to do next. I get stuck at times, to be sure, but when I do I have clean and direct ways to satisfy myself that I should just beat away at that roadblock for the time being.</div><br><div>\"And then, for beating away at the roadblock, my bookkeeping regarding what I've tried, what possibilities I've collected, and what my assumptions and objectives are, is good enough to help tremendously in keeping me from getting into loops and quandaries,in carefully ex hausting possibilities, and in really analyzing my assumptions and objectives. What's more, I'm not generating reams of cyclic arguments, lists, calculations, or the like--either I'm checking the validity of what I've already structured, or I am correcting or expanding the structure. In other words, it seems that the growth of my comprehension is sure and steady up to the point at which I succeed or give up. If I give up, I leave a structure which is very well organized to accommodate a subsequent revisit with new data, possibilities, assumptions, objectives, or tools. Also, I set up a sentinel process that will operate in the future to help alert me to concepts which may clear the block.</div><br><div>\"This feature, of always having satisfying actions to perform, and having a good feeling that they are what I should be doing at that time, gives a surprisingly contented, eager, and absorbing flavor to my work. I guess it's an adult instance of the sort of change observed in students when they were given teaching machines that provided continuous participation and reinforcement.</div><br><div>\"Anyway, with the quick flexibility available to me for structuring arguments, and semi-automatic application of special tagging and linking rules, I find it really quite easy to construct, use, or modify sophisticated process structuring. And I can turn right around and apply this toward improving my abllity for structuring argumentg and processes. The initial, straightforward capabilities for manipulating symbol structures, that were more or less obviously availed me by the computer have given to me a power to participate in more sophisticated processes that capitalize more fully upon the computer's capability--processes which are very significant to my net effectiveness, and yet which weren't particularly apparent to us as either possible or useful in the days before we started harnessing computers to the human's workaday activities in this direct way.'</div><br><div>7. Team Cooperation</div><br><div>\"Let me mention another bonus feature that wasn't easily fore seen. We have experimented with having several people work together from working stations that can provide inter-communication via their computer or computers. That is, each person is equipped as I am here, with free access to the common working structures. There proves to be a really phenomenal boost in group effectiveness over any previous form of cooperation we have experienced. They can all work on the same symbol structure, wherever they might wish. If any two want to work simultaneously on the same material, they simply duplicate and each starts reshaping his version--and later it is easy to merge their contributions. The whole team can join forces at a moment's notice to 'pull together' on some stubborn little problem, or to make a group decision. Most points of contention are resolved quite naturally, over a period of time, as the developing structure of argument bears out one, or the other, or neither stand.</div><br><div>\"No one can dominate the show, since seldom do you have to 'listen' to the person concurrent to the developments he is pursuing-- and yet at any time another person can tune in on what he has done and is doing. One can either take immediate personal issue with another about some feature, anywhere in the structure where he might find something done by the other to which he wants to take issue, or he can append his objection and the associated argument there where the disagreement lies, and tag this with a special cue that signals a point of contention that must ultimately be resolved. Any idea of the moment by any member can easily be linked to where it can do some good. It gets to be like a real whing-ding free-for-all--tremendously stimulating and satisfying, and things really get done. You find yourself 'playing over your head' almost all of the time.</div><br><div>\"We have been experimenting with multi-disciplinary teams and are becoming especially excited over the results. For instance, there is a great reduction of the barrier that their different terminologies used to represent, where one specialist couldn't really apply his experien ce, intuition, or conceptual feel very well unless the situation could be stated and framed in his accustomed manner, and yet the others couldn't work with his terminology. Here, they meet at their concept and terminology interface and work out little shifts in meaning and use which each can find digestible in his system, and which permit quite precise definitions in each system of the terms and concepts in the others. In studying the other's structuring then, either of them can have his own definitions automatically substituted for the other's special terms. Reduce this language barrier, and provide the feature of their being able to work in parallel independence on the joint structure, and what seems to result is amplification of their different capabilities.</div><br><div>\"Remember the term, synergesis, that has been associated in the literature with general structuring theory? Well, here is something of an example. Three people working together in this augmented mode seem to be more than three times as effective in solving a complex problem as is one augmented person working alone--and perhaps ten times as effective as three similar men working together without this computer-based augmentation. It is a new and exhiliarating experience to be working in this independent-parallel fashion with some good men. We feel that the effect of these augmentation developments upon group methods and group capability is actually going to be more pronounced than the effect upon individuals methods and capabilities, and we are very eager to increase our research effort in that direction.\"</div><br><div>8. Miscellaneous Advanced Concepts</div><br><div>\"I have dragged you through a lot of different concepts and methods so far. I haven't been complete because we won't have the time. But I have selected the sample features to present to you with an eye toward giving you a maximum chance to identify these as being something significant to your own type of work. I avoided discussing techniques applicable to esoteric problem-solving processes--although some of them display especially stimulating possibilities to those with appropriate backgrounds. The ability to structure arguments organized in English-language statements, and to make use of the linking and tagging capabilities at all levels of the structure, can be seen to lead to many interesting and promising new capabilities for organizing your thoughts and actions. I think you could picture learning these tricks and using them in your own work.</div><br><div>\"What I hoped to avoid by presenting the system in this way, was losing your identification with these possibilities by letting you get the mistaken impression that an individual couldn't harness these techniques usefully unless he first learned a lot of very sophisticated new language, logic and math. It is true that the more of the sophisticated tricks you learn, the more computer power you can harness and the more powerful you become--but very significant and personally thrilling practical problem-solving capabilities have been developed by quite a few subjects who were given only fifteen hours of training at one of these stations. The training, incidentally, was all provided by the computer without the presence of a human instructor. And the people were of such diverse fields as sociology, biology, engineering management, applied mathematics, and law. These were all relatively high-level people, and they were completely and unreservedly unanimous in their faith that their increased capability would easily justify the capital and operating outlay that we predicted for work stations of this sort in five years, if the computer industry really were to take this type of potential market seriously.</div><br><div>\"What these people became capable of was somewhat less than the range of capabilities that we have discussed so far--but they would find it very natural to develop further techniques on their own, and new teaching programs could be provided them so that they could continue learning the improved techniques turned out by a research group such as ours here.</div><br><div>\"But let me give you a brief view of some of the more advanced concepts and techniques that have evolved here, compatible with, but beyond, what I have so far shown you. And evolved is a good word to use here, because our appreciation for the potential worth of possibilities to be developed had to evolve too, and only came with the experience and perspective gained in our earlier work.</div><br><div>\"For instance, we initially felt that defining categories and relationships, and making a plan for action, were things to be done as quickly as possible so that we could get on with the work. But, as our means developed for dealing with definitions and plans more precisely, easily, and flexibly, we began to realize that they in reality might be the most significant part of that work. With our immenseiy increased capability for complex bookkeeping relative to our interlaced hierarchies of objectives, plans, and arguments, we found that defining a new cate gory, searching for members or instances of it, or applying its selection criteria were becoming ever conscious and specific tasks.</div><br><div>\"For instance, we began to find it more and more useful to distinguish different categories or types of process, different types of arguments, different types of relationships, and different types of descriptions. For a specific example, Ranganathan1 once cited five specific relationships that could obtain between two terms, where one modifies the other. He called these phase relations, and named how one term could relate to the other as either biasing it, being a tool used to study it, being an aspect of it, being in comparison with it, or influencing it. Vickery gave more examples, saying one could also have an effect on the other, be a cause of it, be a use for it, be a substitute for it, a source for it, an implication of it, be an explanation of it, or be a representation of it. There are even more categories mentioned in the literature.</div><br><div>\"It was easy to form tags and links, and we experimented with the gains to be made by consciously specifying and indicating categories. It turned out to be a very invigorating innovation, and we began to take more pains with our s.tructuring. It took longer to set up links and nodes in our structures, to be sure, but we found on the one hand that the structures became much cleaner and required fewer members, and on the other hand that we could get considerably more sophisticated help from the computer in doing significant chores for us.</div><br><div>\"We began to work up processes that would help us establish categories, give them good definitions, check their relationship with other established categories, decide whether something fit a given category or not, search for all possible members of it within a given substructure, and so forth. The very fact of using this careful classifi cation within our structures allowed us to get more powerful help from the computer in these classification processes. I should mention that the relationships among the terms in a sentence--the syntax if you wish--had been given further specification tags than those I showed you earlier, to remove ambiguities that hindered the computer from going back to a statement and resolving the syntactical structure. Also, ambiguities in the meaning of the terms began to limit us, and we developed methods for removing a good deal of this semantic ambiguity. This slowed us down, as I've mentioned, but not as much as you'd think.</div><br><div>\"Let me demonstrate one of the advanced processes which has evolved. It is heavily dependent upon the very care in building structures that it so nicely facilitates, and also upon several other developments. One of these other developments stems from the concepts and techniques of the semantic differential, as first introduced by Osgood, Suci, and Tannenbaum2 back in 1957, and from some subsequent work by Mayer and Bagley3 on what they called semantic models. These offered useful possibilities for establishing quite precisely what meaning a concept has to an individual, relative to his general conceptual framework, and for representing this meaning in a specific way that was amenable to computer manipulation.</div><br><div>\"The other development upon which this process to be exhibited is based, was stimulated by our realizing that flexible cooperation with the computer was calling for lots of little interactions. Our working repertoire of small-task requests for computer service was getting quite large, and it was proving to be extremely valuable to use them and to be able to remember automatically their procedures and designation codes. One of our research psychologists had worked on human-memory phenomena before he came with us, and had interested himself in mnemonic aids of all sorts. He has developed some useful techniques for us to use in connection with this, and other problems. Now let me demonstrate this example of an advanced process for helping work with categories.</div><br><div>\"Suppose that I want to establish a new category. Let's say that I have developed its description in what you and I have been calling an argument structure. I want to give it a name--a short and meaningful one--and I want a good definition. In fact, I want a definition that the computer can later work with. Look, I'll dig up a description that is awaiting such a definition, and you can watch what happens.\" So saying, Joe drummed on his keysets for a moment, with one interruption when the computer flashed something on the screen that was apparently a question about what he was asking the computer to find for him. He finally had a network display on one screen and a set of \"exploded\" statements on the upper half of the other.</div><br><div>\"I'm initiating the naming and defining process now, and de signating to it the argument structure represented by this network as what I want named and defined. Watch what happens.\" A few more strokes on the keyset, and he picked up his light pen in anticipation and waited a few moments. A statement appeared in the lower half of the second frame. He studied it a moment, then looked at the statements above, picked out a node on the network with the pen, and hit the keyset a few strokes. Another statement flashed on almost immediately, with two familiar adjectives placed below and a graduated line between them. Joe studied this, referred to the statements above, flipped through several levels of network portrayals, through a few statements representing a couple of low-level nodes, reflected a moment, and then pointed his light pen at a point on the graduated line, part way between the adjectives, and pressed its button.</div><br><div>\"Actually, right now I'm demonstrating a cooperative process execution technique. This process is applying some very sophisticated criteria and using some very sophisticated analytical techniques, and it is set up so that it is actually the computer that is now in the executive seat. I called for the process, but its execution essentially involves the computer's asking me questions, and feeding me successive questions according to how I've answered the previous ones. It also is doing a lot of work on the symbol structure that represents my description. It, with some small help from me, is proceeding through a quite complex analysis of the meaning that this incipient concept has to me, and of certain types of mental associations that I may have with it. I don't have to remember the special rules and forms of analysis involved-- nevertheless, a very sophisticated little capability is mine to use at will, taxing neither me nor the computer.\"</div><br><div>After a little over a minute of these question-answer interactions, the process apparently terminated, with four lines of special terms remaining on the screen. \"This first line gives me two suggested names for this category or concept. The first term is a newly coined formal name, while the remaining three terms represent a compound expression, involving established concepts, that can be used also as a designation of the new category. The second line furnishes me with an association chain to use for a mnemonic aid in remembering the new name-- linking the name to several characteristics of the concept. The name itself was selected under mnemonic criteria, as well as to have a structure that goes with its syntactic and semantic categories. The third line lists the names of some previously defined categories or concepts that are the closest to this in meanlng--these before the break were found to overlap, and the rest are just close.</div><br><div>\"The fourth line you recognize as a statement form, perhaps. This is the definition, as developed by the computer. It's in a special language and I won't try to explain. I'll just mention that I can now study it, take it apart, check its references, so to speak, and perhaps even see if the computer and I might work out any changes or improvementS But this process has been worked on pretty hard, and we're getting definitions that are hard to improve.</div><br><div>\"This special language, in which I said the definition was stated, is a recent development. We had found that the types of structuring we were developing had a lot of extra tags and links that were traceable to the complexity of the rules and combinatorial possibilities of the English language with which the statements were construct We finally got a clear enough picture of the requirements we place upon a language in our use here that we could consider designing our own special language. It turned out to be a straightforward and rather simple language compared with English, but much more precise and powerful. It proves rather inflexible and awkward to use for speaking, but it provides plenty of flexibility and power for expressing things in the visual-symbol forms that we use. Its precision leaves no syntactic ambiguity in a well-formed statement, and makes it much easier to reduCe semantic ambiguity to the point where the computer can deal with our statements much as it can with mathematical or formal-logic expressionc</div><br><div>\"It is worth mentioning, too, that we are experimenting with standard ways of structuring arguments at levels higher than the state ments--sort of a super grammar or syntax, with rules for assembling argument modules of different function lnto what becomes a well-formed higher-level argument module. There are some mixed feelings around here about this possibility, but I myself have become very much excited by it.</div><br><div>\"Also we have been introducing formal methods for manipulating what you might call reasonable statements--as opposed to absolute true false statements which the more familiar formal logic can manipulate. This finds approval and faith in all of us here, but it is going a bit slowly.</div><br><div>\"Let's run over some of the results we've seen to date, stemming from this new language and the new semantic awareness thus given the computer. If it can get hold of and manipulate important aspects of the meaning that is contained in our structures, it can develop answers to some questions for which there existed only conceptually implicit data. With practice and good strategy, asking questions like this proves to be a tremendously effective way to gain comprehension about a structure. We even have special processes and symbol-structuring methods to help organize the questioning and the answers. Some of the answers are a bit costly, however--in computer time and charges--and we have to watch the way we ask questions. Some of our researchers are studying the language and structuring techniques relative to this problem, and they think they see ways to change them to make question answering generally more efficient. But this sort of thing will likely always have its cost problems, as far as we can see now.\"</div><br><div>He went on to say that the computer now represents such an intelligent helper--although much less so than any human helper they would hire--that they refer to it as the Clerk. They can make a tentative new statement in the development of a structure, and have the clerk look over the structure to detect inconsistency or redundancy. The Clerk can also point out some of the weaknesses in the statement, as well as some of the effects of the statement upon the rest of the structure. They find that they need to give less and less human concern for the details of structure building--in-fact, the roles have reversed a little. Where the human used to set up tags and links so the computer could find its way around the structure as it ran errands for him, they now have the computer studiously installing similar things that are for the benefit of the human when he is studying the structure.</div><br><div>He also mentioned a recently developed computer process that could go back over a record of the human actions involved in establishing a given argument structure and do a creditable job of picking out the steps which contributed the most to the final picture--and also some of those that contributed least. This process, and some of the past data collected by its use, were becoming an important addition to the planning review sessions, as well as to the continuing development of improved methods. And apparently, it had a surprisingly positive psychological effect upon members of a cooperating team, where an objective means of relative scoring was thus available.</div><br><div>- - -</div><br><div>Let yourself be disengaged now from your role in the above discussion-demonstration. You have been through an experience that was designed to give you a feel for the sort of future developments that (to us) are predictable from our conceptual framework. What is presented in Section II is an attempt at giving a \"straight\" presentation of the various conceptual segments of this framework, and Section III hopefully supplemented the formal presentation to provide you with a more complete picture of how we are oriented and what sorts of possibilities impel us.</div><br><div>Assuming that we have communicated our conceptual framework in some reasonable form, we proceed below to discuss the question of what to do about it. Our approach to this question is with the view that energetic pursuit of this research could be of considerable significance to society, and that research should stem from a big enough picture of the over-all possibilities so that the contribution of any program, large or small, could have maximum long-range significance. Our recommendations are fairly general, and are cast in rather global terms, but we assert that they can be readily recast into the specific terms required of research planning to be done for a given project, within a given set of subgoals and research-activity constraints. In fact, we are now engaged in the process of so recasting these general recommendations into specific plans (for the experimental research to be pursued here at Stanford Research Institute).</div><br><div>IV. RESEARCH RECOMMENDATIONS</div><br><div>A. OBJECTIVES FOR A RESEARCH PROGRAM</div><br><div>The report has put forth the hypothesis that the intellectual effectiveness of a human being is dependent upon factors which are subject to direct redesign in pursuit of an increase in that effectiveness. A conceptual framework is offered to help in giving consideration to this hypothesis, and an extensive and personalized projection into possible future developments is presented to help develop a feeling for the possi bilities and promise implicit in the hypothesis and conceptual structure.</div><br><div>If this hypothesis and its glowing extrapolations were borne out in future developments, the consequences would be most exciting and assumedly beneficial to a problem-laden world. What is called for now is a test of this hypothesis and a calibration on the gains if any that might be realized by giving total-system design attention to human intellectual effectiveness. If the test and calibration proved to be favorable, then we can set to work developing better and better augmentation systems for our problem solvers.</div><br><div>In this light, we recommend a research program approach aimed at (Goal 1) testing the hypothesis, (Goal 2) developing the tools and tech niques for designing better augmentation systems, and (Goal 3) producing real-world augmentation systems that bring maximum gains over the coming years to the solvers of tough, critical problems. These goals and the resulting design for their pursuit are idealized, to be sure, but the results nonetheless have valuable aspects.</div><br><div>B. BASIC RESEARCH CONDITIONS</div><br><div>This should be an empirical approach on a total-system basis--i.e., doing coordinated study and innovation, among all the factors admitted to the problem, in conjunction with experiments that provide realistic action and interplay among these variables. The question of limiting these factors is considered later in the section. The recommended en vironment for this empirical, total-system approach, is a laboratory providing a computer-backed display and communication system of the general sort described in Section III-B. There should be no stinting on the capabilities provided--it is very important to learn what value any given artifact feature may offer the total system, and the only way to learn the value is to experiment with the feature. At this point no time will be taken to develop elaborate improvements in the art of time sharing, to provide real-time service to many users. This kind of development should be done as separate, backup work. The experimental lab should take the steps that are immediately available to provide all the service to the human that he needs in the experimental environment.</div><br><div>Where economy demands that a computer not be idle during the time the augmented subject is not using it (which would be a rather large net fraction of the time, probably), and where sharing the computer with other real-time users for which demand delays are a problem, then the only sharing that should be considered is that with off-line computations for which there are no real-time service demands to be met. The computer can turn away from off-line users whenever the on-line worker needs attention of any sort.</div><br><div>C. WHOM TO AUGMENT FIRST</div><br><div>The experimental work of deriving, testing, and integrating innovations into a growing system of augmentation means must have a specific type of human task to try to develop more effectiveness for, to give unifying focus to the research. We recommend the particular task of computer programming for this purpose--with many reasons behind the selection that should come out in the following discussion. Some of the more direct reasons are these:</div><br><div>1. The programmer works on many problems, including large and realistic ones, which can be solved without interaction with other humans. This eases the experimentalproblem.<br>2. Typical and realistic problems for the programmer to solve can be posed for experimental purposes that do not involve large amounts of working and reference in formation. This also eases the experimental problem.<br>3. Much of the programmer's working data are computer programs (he also has, we assume, his own reasoning and planning notes), which have unambiguous syntactic and semantic form so that getting the computer to do useful tasks for him on his working data will be much facilitated--which helps very much to get early experience on the value a human can derlve from this kind of computer help.<br>4. A programmer's effectiveness, relative to other programmers, can probably be measured more easily than would be the case for most other complex-problem solvers. For example, few other complex solutions or designs beside a program can so easily be given the rigorous test of Does it actually work?<br>5. The programmer's normal work involves interactions with a computer (although heretofore not generally on-line), and this will help researchers use the computer as a tool for learning about the programmer's habits and needs.<br>6. There are some very challenging types of intellectual effort involved in programming. Attempting to increase human effectiveness therein will provide an excellent means for testing our hypothesis.<br>7. Successful achievements in evolving new augmentation means which significantly improve a programmer's capability will not only serve to prove the hypothesis, but will lead directly to possible practical application of augmentation systems to a real-world problem domain that can use help.<br>8. Computer programmers are a natural group to be the first in the real world to incorporate the type of augmentation means we are considering. They already know how to work in formal methodologies with computers, and most of them are associated with activities that have to have computers anyway, so that the new tech niques, concepts, methods, and equipment will not seem so radical to them and will be relatively easy for them to learn and acquire.<br>9. Successful achievements can be utilized within the augmentation-research program itself, to improve the effectiveness of the computer programming activity involved in studying and developing augmentation systems. The capability of designing, implementing, and modifying computer programs will be very inlportant to the rate of research progress.</div><br><div>Workers in an augmentation-research laboratory are the most natural people in the world to be the very first users of the augmentation means they develop, and we think that they represent an extremely important group of people to make more effective at their work.</div><br><div>D. BASIC REGENERATIVE FEATURE</div><br><div>The feature brought forth in Reason 9 above is something that offers tremendous value to the research objectives--i.e., the feeding back of positive research results to improve the means by which the researchers themselves can pursue their work The plan we are describing here is designed to capitalize upon this feature as much as possible, as will be evident to the reader as he progresses through this section. This positive-feedback (or regenerative) possibility derives from the facts that: (1) our researchers are developing means to increase the effectiveness of humans dealing with complex intellectual problems, and (2) our researchers are dealing with complex intellectual problems. In other words, they are developing better tools for a class to which they themselves belong. If their initial work needs the unifying focus of concentrating upon a specific tool, let that tool be one important to them and whose improvement will really help their own work.</div><br><div>E. TOOLS DEVELOPED AND TOOLS USED</div><br><div>This close similarity between tools being developed and the tools being used to do the developing, calls for some care in our terminology if we want to avoid confusion in our reasoning about their relationship. Augmentation means will be used to name the tools being developed by the augmentation research. Subject lnformation will be used to refer to description and reasoning concerned with the subject of these tools (as opposed to the method of research), and subject matter will refer to both subject information and physical devices being incorporated as artifacts in the augmentation means being developed. Tools and techniques will be used to name the tools being used to do that research, and are likely here to include special additions to language, artifact, and methodology that particularly improve the special capabilities exercised in doing the research.</div><br><div>An integrated set of tools and techniques will represent an art of doing augmentation research. Although no such art exists ready-made for our use, there are many applicable or adaptable tools and techniques to be borrowed from other disciplines. Psychology, computer programming and physical technology, display technology, artificial intelligence, industrial engineering (e.g., motion and time study), management science, systems analysis, and information retrieval are some of the more likely sources. These disciplines also offer initial subject matter for the research. Because this kind of diagramming can help more later on, we represent in Fig. 3 the situation of the beginning research drawing upon existing disciplines for subject matter and tools and techniques.</div><br><div>The program begins with general dependence upon other, existing dis ciplines for its subject matter (solid arrow) and its tools and tech niques (dashed arrow). Goal 1 has been stated as that of verifying the basic hypothesis that concerted augmentation research can increase the intellectual effectiveness of human problem solvers.</div><br><div>Fig. 3 Initial Augmentation-Research Program</div><br><div>F. RESEARCH PLAN FOR ACTIVITY A l</div><br><div>The dominant goal of Activity A 1 (Goal 1, as in Fig 3) is to test our hypothesis. Its general pursuit of augmenting a programmer is designed to serve this goal, but also to be setting the stage for later direct pursuit of Goals 2 and 3 (i.e., developing tools and techniques for augmentation research and producing real-world augmentation systems).</div><br><div>Before we discuss the possible subject matter through which this research might work, let us treat the matter of its tools and techniques. Not too long ago we would have recommended (and did), in the spirit of taking the long-range and global approach, that right from the beginning of a serious program of this sort there should be established a careful and scientific methodology. Controlled experiments, with special re search subjects trained and tested in the use of experimental new aug mentation means, careful monitoring, record-keeping, and evaluative procedures, etc. This was to be accompanied by a thorough search through disciplines and careful incorporation of useful findings.</div><br><div>Still in the spirit of the long-range and global sort of planning, but with a different outlook (based, among other things, upon an increased appreciation for the possibilities of capitalizing upon regeneration), we would now recommend that the approach be quite different. We basically recommend A 1 research adhering to whatever formal methodology is required for (a) knowing when an improvement in effectiveness has been achieved, and (b) knowing how to assign relative value to the changes derived from two competing innovations.</div><br><div>Beyond this, and assuming dedication to the goal, reasonable maturity, and plenty of energy, intelligence, and imagination, we would recommend turning loose a group of four to six people (or a number of such groups) to develop means that augment their own programming capability We would recommend that their work begin by developing the capability for composing and modifying simple symbol structures, in the manner pictured in Section III-B-2, and work up through a hierarchy of intermediate capabilities toward the single high-level capability that would encompass computer programming. This would allow their embryonic and free wheeling \"art of doing augmentation research to grow and work out its kinks through a succession of increasingly complex system problems--and also, redesigning a hierarchy from the bottom up somehow seems the best approach</div><br><div>As for the type of programming to tell them to become good at--tell them, \u00d1the kind that you find you have to do in your research.\" In other words, their job assignment is to develop means that will make them more effective at doing their job. Figure 4 depicts this schematically, with the addition to what was shown in Fig. 3 of a connection that feeds the subject-matter output of their research (augmentation means for their type of programming problems) right back into their activity as improved tools and techniques to use in their research.</div><br><div>Fig. 4 Regeneration</div><br><div>If they are making head way, it won't take any carefully worded criterion of effectiveness nor any great sophistication in measurement technique to tell that they are more effective with the augmentation means than without--being quicker to \"design and build\" a running program to meet given processing specifications or being quicker to pick up a complex existing program, gain comprehension as necessary, and find its flaws or rebuild it. On the other hand, if no gains are really obvious after a year or so, then it is time to begin incorporating more science in their approach. By then there will be a good deal of basic orientation as to the nature of the problem to which \"science\" is to be applied.</div><br><div>What we are recommending in a way is that the augmented capability hierarchy built by this group represent more a quick and rough scaffolding than a carefully engineered structure. There is orientation to be derived from climbing up quickly for a look that will be of great value. For instance, key concepts held initially, that would have been laboriously riveted into the well-engineered structure, could well be rendered obsolete by the \u00d1view\" obtained from higher in the hierarchy. And besides, it seems best to get the quick and rough improvements built and working first, so that the research will benefit not only from the orientation obtained, but from the help that these improvements will provide when used as tools and techniques to tackle the tougher or slower possibilities. As progress begins to be made toward Goal l,the diagram of Fig. 3 will become modified by feeding the subject-matter output (augmentation means for computer programmers) back into the input as new tools and techniques to be used by the researchers.</div><br><div>We would suggest establishing a sub-activity within A 1, whose purpose and responsibility is to keep an eye on the total activity, assess and evaluate its progress and try to provide orientation as to where things stand and where attention might be beneficial.</div><br><div>A few words about the subject matter through which Activity A 1 may progress. The researchers will think of simple innovations and try them in short order--and perhaps be stimulated in the process by realizing how handy some new feature would be that would help them whip up trial processes in a hurry. They will know of basic capabllitles they want to work toward for structuring their argumentsJ their planning, their factual data, etc., 50 that they can more easily get computer help in developing themJ in analyzing and pursuing comprehension within themJ and in modifying or extending them. They wlll try different types of structuring and see how easy it ls to design computer processes to manipulate them or composite processes to do total useful work with them.</div><br><div>They can work up programs that can search through other programs for answers to questions about them--questions whose answers serve the processes of debugging, extending, or modifying. Perhaps there will be ways they adopt in the initial structuring of a program--e.g., appending stylized descriptive cues here and there--that have no function in the execution of that program, but which allow more sophisticated fact retrieval therein by the computer. Perhaps such cue tagging would allow development of programs which could automatically make fairly sophisticated modifications to a tagged program. Maybe there would evolve semi-automatic \"super-compilers,\" with which the programmer and the computer leap-frog over the obstacles to formulating exact specifications for a computer (or perhaps composlte) process and getting it into whatever programming language they use.</div><br><div>G. A SECOND PHASE IN THE RESEARCH PROGRAM</div><br><div>The research of A 1 could probably spiral upwards indefinitely, but once the hypothesis (see Section IV-A) has been reasonably verified and the first of our stated objectives satisfied, it would be best to re-organize the program. To describe our recommendation here, let us say that two research activies, A 2 and A 3, are set up in place of A 1. Whether A 1 is split, or turned into A 2 and a new group formed for A 3, does not really matter here--we are speaking of separate activities, corresponding to the responsible pursuit of separate goals, that will benefit from close cooperation.</div><br><div>To Activity A 2 assign the job of developing augmentation means to be used specifically as tools and techniques by the researchers of both A 2 and A 3. This establishes a continuing pursuit for Objective 2 of Section IY-A. A 2 will now set up a sub-activity that studies the problems of all the workers in A 2 and A 3 and isolates a succession of capabilities for which the research of A 2 will develop means to augment. Activity A 2 should be equipped with the best artifacts available to an experimental laboratory.</div><br><div>To Activity A 3 assign the job of developing augmentation systems that can be practically adopted into real-world problem situations. This provides a direct and continuing pursuit of Goal 3 of Section IV-A. It is to be assumed that the first real-world system that A 3 will design will be for computer programmers. For this it might well be able to clean up the \u00d1laboratory model\" developed in A 1, modify it to fit the practical limitations represented by real-world economics, working environments, etc., and offer it as a prototype for practical adoption. Or Activity A 3 might do a redesign, benefitting from the experience with the first model.</div><br><div>Activity A 3 will need a subactivity to study its potential users and guide the succession of developments that it pursues. Activity A 2 in its continued pursuit of increased effectiveness among workers in idealized environment, will be the source for basic subject matter in the developments of A 3, as well as for its tools and techniques. From the continously expanding knowledge and developments of A 2, A 3 can organize successive practical systems suitable for ever more general utilization.</div><br><div>We have assumed that what was developed in A 1 was primarily language and methodology, with the artifacts not being subject to appreciable modification during the research. By this second phase, enough has been learned about the trends and possibilities for this type of on-line man-computer cooperation that some well-based guidance can be derived for the types of modifications and extensions to artifact capability that would be most valuable. Activity A 2 could continue to derive long-range guidance for equipment development, perhaps developing laboratory innovations in computers, display systems, storage systems, or communication systems, but at least experimenting with the incorporation of the new artifact innovations of others.</div><br><div>An example of the type of guidance derived from this research might be extracted from the concepts discussed in Section-C-5 (Structure Types). We point out there that within the computer there might be built and manipulated symbol structures that represent better images of the concept structures of interest to the human than would any symbol structure with which the human could work directly. To the human, the computer represents a special instrument which can display to him a comprehensible image of any characteristic of this structure that may be of interest. From our conceptual viewpoint, this would be a source of tremendous power for the human to harness, but it depends upon the computer being able to read all of the stored information (which would be in a form essentially incomprehensible to a human). Now, if this conjecture is borne out there would be considerably less value in micro-image information-storage systems than is now generally presumed. In other words, we now conjecture that future reference information will be much more valuable if stored in computer-sensible form. The validity of this and other conjectures stemming from our conceptual framework could represent critical questions to manufacturers of information systems.</div><br><div>It is obvious that this report stems from generalized large-view thinking. To carry this to something of a final view, relative to the research recommendations, we present Fig. 5, which should be largely self-explanatory by this time. Activity A 2 is lifting itself by the bootstraps up the scale of intellectual capability, and its products are siphoned to the world via A 3. Getting acceptance and application of the new techniques to the most critical problems of our society might in fact be the most critical problem of all by then, and Activity A 4 would be one which should be given special help from A 3.</div><br><div>There is another general and long-range picture to present. This is in regard to a goal for a practically usable system that A 3 would want to develop as soon as possible. You might call this the first general Computer Augmentation System--CAUG-I (pronounced cog-one).</div><br><div>Fig. 5: A Total Program<br>Suggested relationship among the major activities in achieving the stated objective (essentially, of significantly boosting human power in A 4 and U 1). Solid lines represent subject information or artifacts used or generated within an activity, and dashed lines represent special tools and techniques for doing the activity in the box to which they connect. Subject product of an activity (output solid) can be used as working material (input solid) or as tools and techniques (input dashed). Tools and techniques as used or needed in an activity (output dashed) can be used either to work on (input solid) or as tools and techniques to work with (input dashed).</div><br><div>It would be derived from what was assessed to be the basic set of capabilities needed by both a general-problem-solvlng human and an augmentation researcher. Give CAUG-I to a real-world problem solver in almost any discipline, and he has the basic capabilities for structuring his arguments and plans, organizing special files, etc., that almost anyone could expect to need. In addition to these direct-application on capabilities, however, are provided those capabilities necessary for analyzing problem tasks, developing and evaluating new process capabilities, etc., as would be required for him to extend the CAUG-I system to match to the special features of his problem area and the way he likes to work.</div><br><div>In other words, CAUG-I represents a basic problem-solving tool kit, plus an auxiliary tool-makers tool kit with which to extend the basic tool kit to match the particular job and particular worker. In subsequent phases, Activity A 3 could be turning out successive generations (CAUG-II, CAUG-III, etc.) each incorporating features that match an ever-more-powerful capability hierarchy in an ever-more-efficient manner to the basic capabilities of the human.</div><br><div>V. SUMMARY</div><br><div>This report has treated one over-all view of the augmentation of human intellect. In the report the following things have been done: (1) An hypothesis has been presented. (2) A conceptual framework has been constructed. (3) A \"picture\" of augmented man has been described. (4) A research approach has been outlined. These aspects will be re viewed here briefly:</div><br><div>1. An hypothesis has been stated that the intellectual effectiveness of a human can be significantly improved by an engineering-like approach toward redesigning changeable components of a system.<br>2. A conceptual framework has been constructed that helps provide a way of looking at the implications and possibilities surrounding and stemming from this hypothesis. Briefly, this framework provides the realization that our intellects are already augmented by means which appear to have the following characteristics:<br>\ta. The principal elements are the language artifacts, and methodology that a human has learned to use.<br>\tb. The elements are dynamically interdependent within an operating system.<br>\tc. The structure of the system seems to be hierarchical, and to be best considered as a hierarchy of process capabilities whose primitive components are the basic human capabilities and the functional capabilities of the artifacts--which are organized successively into ever-more-sophisticated capabilities.<br>\td. The capabilities of prime interest are those associated with manipulating symbols and concepts in support of organizing and executing processes from which are ultimately derived human compre hension and problem solutions.<br>\te. The automatlon of the symbol manipulation associated with the minute-by-minute mental processes seems to offer a logical next step in the evolution of our intellectual capability.<br>3. A picture of the implications and promise of this framework has been described, based upon direct human communication with a computer. Here the many ways in which the computer could be of service, at successive levels of augmented capability, have been brought out. This picture is fanciful, but we believe it to be conservative and representative of the sort of rich and significant gains that are there to be pursued.<br>4. An approach has been outlined for testing the hypothesis of Item (1) and for pursuing the \"rich and significant gains\" which we feel are promised. This approach is designed to treat the redesign of a capability hierarchy by reworking from the bottom up, and yet to make the research on augmentation means progress as fast as possible by deriving practically usable augmentation systems for real-world problem solvers at a maximum rate. This goal is fostered by the recommendation of incorporating positive feedback into the research development--i.e., concentrating a good share of the basic-research attention upon augmenting those capabilities in a human that are needed in the augmentation-research workers The real-world applications would be pursued by designing a succession of systems for specialists, whose progression corresponds to the increasing generality of the capabilities for which coordinated augmentation means have been evolved. Consideration is given in this rather global approach to providing potential users in different domains of intellectualactivity with the basic general-purpose augmentation system from which they themselves can construct the special featuresof a system to match their job, and their ways of working--or it could be used on the other hand by researchers who want to pursue the development of sepcial augmentation systems for special fields.</div><br><div>\t<br>VI. CONCLUSIONS</div><br><div>Three principal conclusions may be drawn concerning the significance and implications of the ideas that have been presented.</div><br><div>First any possibility for improving the effective utilization of the intellectual power of society's problem solvers warrants the most serious consideration. This is because man's problem-solving capability represents possibly the most important resource possessed by a society. The other contenders for first importance are all critically dependent for their development and use upon this resource. Any possibility for evolving an art or science that can couple directly and significantly to the continued development of that resource should warrant doubly serious consideration.</div><br><div>Second, the ideas presented are to be considered in both of the above senses: the direct-development sense and the 'art of development' sense. To be sure, the possibilities have long-term implications, but their pursuit and initial rewards await us now. By our view, we do not have to wait until we learn how the human mental processes work, we do not have to wait until we learn how to make computers more intelligent or bigger or faster, we can begin developing powerful and economically feasible augmentation systems on the basis of what we now know and have. Pursuit of further basic knowledge and improved machines will continue into the unlimited future, and will want to be integrated into the \"art\" and its improved augmentation systems--but getting started now will provide not only orientation and stimulation for these pursuits, but will give us improved problem-solving effectiveness with which to carry out the pursuits.</div><br><div>Third, it becomes increasingly clear that there should be action now--the sooner the better--action in a number of research communities and on an aggressive scale. We offer a conceptual framework and a plan for action, and we recommend that these be considered carefully as a basis for action If they be considered but found unacceptable, then at least serious and continued effort should be made toward developing a more acceptable conceptual framework within which to view the over-all approach, toward developing a more acceptable plan of action, or both.</div><br><div>This is an open plea to researchers and to those who ultimately motivate, finance, or direct them, to turn serious attention toward the possibility of evolving a dynamic discipline that can-treat the problem of improving intellectual effectiveness in a total sense. This discipline should aim at producing a continuous cycle of improvements--increased understanding of the problem, improved means for developing new aug mentation systems, and improved augmentation systems that can serve the world's problem solvers in general and this discipline's workers in particular. After all, we spend great sums for disciplines aimed at understanding and harnessing nuclear power. Why not consider developing a discipline aimed at understanding and harnessing \"neural power?\" In the long run, the power of the human intellect is really much the more important of the two.</div>",

The thirty-one useful hand-stroke finger combinations will represent different input <br>designations depending upon the current interpretive case. It is assumed that a computer will interpret these codes, although there may be paper-tape intermediate storage. </div><br><div>At present, I have the logic worked out for the interpretive program, but it is not coded. Judy has been using the full code in practice transcription onto 5-bit punched tape.</div><br><div>I will use the following naming conventions. For Code i, struck in Case n: Cn.i if i is expressed in decimal form, and Cn/i is expressed in octal form. The four printing cases and the Control Case have n of 1,2,3,4, and c respectively. It is often useful, in a.ctions designated from the Control Case, to return interpretation back to the printing case from which Control Case was last entered --and I designate this as Cx. Besides this, Cl, C2, C3, C4, Cc and Cn used alone will designate Cases 1,2,3,4, or Control Case, or any case, respectively. </div><br><div>To shift case one goes through the intermediate Control Case. For instance, to shift from Case 1 to Case 2, hit Cl.27 (shifting to Control Case) and Cc.2 (shifting from Control Case to Case 2). Hitting Cn.27 will always ensure being in Control Case. </div><br><div>1. \tPrinting Cases. <br>\u00a5 \tX ~ ~(... c.)He <br>Abbreviations of sorts are included. Codes Cl.l7 and C2.17 represent the character pair \"qu\" and \"QU\". If a \"q\" is desired without the \"u\", use ON Af Code C3.17 (or C4.17). Also, in Cases 1 and 2, Codes 29 and 30 designate more than nco:rrma\" and \"period.\" Code 29, labelled EOF for End Of Phrase, will designate the character pair \"comna space\". To get a comma without a space following it, use Codes C3.29 or C4.29. Code 30 (in Cases 1 and 2), labelled EOS for End Of Sentence, designates the following: \"period\", \"space\", \"space\", \"shift\" to Case 2 for one character and then to Case 1.\" To get a period, use Code 30 in either of Cases 3 or 4. If a Code 17 is hit after an EOS, the result will be the character pair 'Qu\". </div><br><div>In anticipation of a question following the description of Codes Cc.l5 through Cc.l9--C4. 11, a Backspace code, bas the same effect as backspacing a typewriter. The originally written character p3.st which you backspace remain to be overprinted by succeeding printing characters. </div><br><div>2. Control Case. <br>In Control Case are a number of special features. Codes 1, 2, 3 and 4 designate direct transfer to the corresponding case. Codes 5, 6 and 7 are used for underlining alphabetic characters. Code 5 says, \"return to Cx (the case from which you most recently transferred t.o Control Case) and underline the next character designated,\" Code 6 will send you back to Cx and cause underlining of all succeeding alphabetic characters up to the next occurrence of a code of 28 or greater--essentially, underlining the next word.. Code 7 sends you back to ex and causes underlining of all alphabetic characters until an occurrence of either a Code 28 or a Code 30--for underlining section titles. For Codes Cc. 6 and Cc. 7, a hyphen will be assumed. as a legitimate \"alphabetic\" character to be underlined, but a. double hyphen (representing a dash) will be a terminater of the underlining action. For Cod.i!s Cc. 8 through Cc.l3 we designate a short one-character or \"one-word visit\" to a specified case before shifting back automatically to Cx. Special note: sequence Cc,8, C2.17 results in a printing sequence corresponding to C4. 26, Cx. 21. Similarly, a one-character visit to Code 17 of Case 1 would produce a \"q\" and a Code 21 from Cx. The \"one-word visit\" is terminated by any code equal or greater than 27 9 and that code will be interpreted as though it were in Cx. </div><br><div>Codes Cc. 15 through Cc. 19 -are used for deleting preceding characters. They all have the effect upon the eventual output text of backspacing a magic typewriter that erases any character in a position to which it backspaces. Cc.15 can be hit n times successively to cause n such effective backspace-deletes, each of which eats up one line space. Cc,l6 is used for the last of such a string of backspace-deletes (or when you just want one) if you want to transfer automtically thereafter back to ex. Cc. 17 will automatically do backspace-deletes back to but not including the previous \"space\" and then will transfer you back to Cx. Cc.l8 will automatically do backspace-deletes back to and including (i.e., through) the previous \"period,\" and then transfer you to Cx. Cc .19 will automatically do backspace-deletes back to an including (i.e. , through) the previous \"tab\", and then transfer you to Cx. IMPORTANT NOTE: A delete command is not actually executed until the next printing-case code other than Code 27.</div><br><div>Code Cc. 21, \"Hand Spec,\" is used as part of a procedure to tell the interpretive device which hand you are going to use on the keyset, Following recognition of this code, the computer will assume that the very next input code will use either or both the thumb and index finger but no others -- i.e. you must jump to Cl, C2 or C3 on the next stroke--and it deduces the specified hand from this stroke. Notice that getting to this code from any state can be done entirely with symmetrical codes (codes that are the same for both hands), so that it doesn't matter what hand the interpretation was assuming, or what interpretive case was being used, when you choose to use a give hand to specify the hand-interpretation made. (A Hand_Spec code automatically actuates a Cc.27 code as part of its response.) </div><br><div><br>CONTROL CASE <br>CASE 1 <br>CASE 2 <br>CASE 3 <br>CASE 4 </div><br><div>Cx, underline next <br>alphabetic character <br>ex, underline alphabetic<br>until Code greater than 28 ex, underline alphateics<br>until Code 28 or 30 1-ch C2, Cx <br>Backspace-Delete <br>Backspace-Delete, Cx <br>Delete to SP, Cx <br>Delete thru . Cx <br>Delete thru TAB, Cx <br>Hand Spec. </div><br><div>Reset Control <br>EOP, Cx </div><br><div>Note: Cn refers to case N, where N = 1,2,3, or 4.<br>Co refers to Control Case.<br>Cx refers to Case from which last jumped to Cc.</div><br><div>Code Cc.27 (which in other cases ca~es transfer to control case) leaves you in control case, but clears any pending control action which the code interpreter may be writing to complete -- e.g. Blly of the underline, case-visit or delete actions. <br>Code Cc.28, labelled EOP for End Of Paragraph will automatically set up the output for a new paragraph. For typewriter output present convention, this would provide the sequence equivalent to C3.50J> C3.313 C3.28, C3.281 C3.9, Cc.l, Cc.B. </div><br><div>3. Future Possibilities. <br>a. Extension of the above <br>Below are a few salient possibilities among the many that will undoubtedly be uncovered with future study. It will generally require coo~inated analysis of editorial conventions and occurrence frequencies to establish efficient transcription cades for an interpretive program of reasonable size and operating cost. <br>(1) Automatic Underlining. A number of odd conditions seem to arise in trying to specify how far ahead in the text you want printed characters to be underlined. Cc. 5 through Cc. 7 as designated above don't easlly handle all of these. More study is required of occurrence frequency for such conditions before one could say how best to designate codes to handle them. </div><br><div>One new-code possibility, would say, return to Cx and underline all legitimte characters until a Cc. 27 code is struck. Perhaps several such would be useful, depending upon what are to be specified as legitimate characters (e.g. sometimes a space is underlined, sometimes not). </div><br><div>Another new-code possibility, call it Cc.j, would be used in a two-stroke sequence Cc.j, Cx.k, which is then to be followed by printing designations in Cx. Underlining will automatically occur, for all legitimate characters, up to and including the next occurrence of Code k in Case x. </div><br><div>(2) Automatic Delete (and Place Finding). In some situations, e.g. involving, prior case-shift, between-sentence and between-paragraph that are to be corrected, it is not clear that delete commands such as Cc.l5 through Cc.l9 provide the best facility for deleting and relocating. Especially for an off-line operator who can't see the effect of such commands as interpreted by the computer. Also, an off-line operator may become lost by losing track of recent code strokes and/or their consequences, and may need a straightforward way to relocate correctly. </div><br><div>A Control-Case code could be used to tell the interpreter: \"Go to Cc, observe the next word, W, that I enter and search backward until the first occurrence of W. Delete all old entry back through the old W, and, beginning with my new W entry, accept subsequent entry as normal continuation.\" If you got lost, you could thus go back and restart at a previous unique word where you knew you had been doing all right. This command also allows flexible specification of deletion. </div><br><div>A variant of this code might be preferable, where you follow the Cc command code with a digit (or, two digits) that specify a number, n, The. interpreter is to observe the symbol string S composed of the next n input character, and use S (exactly as it would use W in the original variation) to locate the renewed starting point back in the prior input. </div><br><div>For on-line use with CRT feedback, one need not specify n in the latter variant of the command. He could (after giving the command) merely start entering characters and watching a \"place marker\" until the computer had enough input to have set the marker at the desired spots then hit two Code 27 strokes to clear control and stop the search. </div><br><div>(3) First Person Singular. We can rather easily incorporate the convention that a Cl.B code (lower-case i) immediately preceded and followed by space codess is to be outputted as if it were a C2.9 code. </div><br><div>(4) New Sections. This regards test-block categories larger than the paragraph. More study is needed, with establishment of consistent conventions for headings to sections of different levels. Automatic format help for these headings --e.g. capitalization and underlining -- could be obtained, as well as coordinated subsequent-paragraph indentation. A Cc Code (or set of them) could be used to designate a new section and the section type or level. This can include listings and quoted inserts. </div><br><div>(5) Specifying Abbreviations. The \"qu\", EOF, EOS, underline, visit, delete, and EOP codes all are abbreviations, and further study of standard transcription message types will undoubtedly suggest other of the types. This section, however, concerns abbreviations the user may wish to establish temporarily or permanently for himself. </div><br><div>One Control-Case code could be used to declare that you were going to establish an abbreviation form. You then enter the full form (both control and data) of the input string you wish to abbreviate, and install a unique separate input code. You follow with the unique characters (abbreviation form, F) by which you wish to enter (designate) the abbreviation in the future. Henceforth, entry of the abbreviation form will automatically cause substitution of the full form to produce words and/or control sequences. </div><br><div>Another Cc code could be used to effect removal of a given abbreviation form -- and still another Cc code could be used to designate which group or groups of abbreviations you might wish to make use of -- if such would be useful. There could well be a standard set you would wish to use basically, to which in some given writing place you could usefully add some of your own. Unless you remembered these local-use additions, and could control their accumulation and discarding, it could be very handy to call for a fresh start with a standard group of abbreviations. </div><br><div>We could ask the interpreter to check every input word against a table of abbreviation forms -- or we could constrain all such forms to begin with one particular character (or one of a special set of characters) so that lookup was done for only those input words beginning with a special character -- or we could say that a special Cc code must accompany every input word which is to be interpreted as an abbreviation form. </div><br><div>Personally, I would think there are few enough normal words beginning with z or x to let one or both of them, as an initial character of a word, tell the interpreter to look at the abbreviation tabie. Using a special Cc code to designate thie, where this code has no other use, would seem to be of advantage mainly if you wanted feedback if the interpreter found no such abbreviation form in its table -- since with such as the Z or X designater we would have to let the interpreter point the input word if it didn't find it on the table. </div><br><div>(6) Control Trees. We could forsee possibility in the foregoing section of a number of different control commands associated with setting up or deleting abheviations. These wouldn't be too frequently used, and Cc codes will become precious as we learn more use for them. For less-frequent control commands, it could pay to bundle them in one or more second-level control cases to which entry is made from the first-level Control Case (the one we now have). For still-less-frequent commands, third-level control cases might be fitting, etc. </div><br><div>b. Special Two-Handed Possibilities. Alternating two hands on two keysets definitely seems a usefUl possibility for faster transcription. The interpreter hal!l to keep track of which keyset provides a given entry, and separate Hand Spec procedure is needed for each keyset. Otherwise the string of sequential input codes is interpreted without regard for which keyset enters which code. </div><br><div>We can stipulate that the use, for this type of interpretation, never overlaps his key strokes -- i.e. only one set of keys is depressed at a time. We can then etipulat.e that. if overlap exists, the two overlapped codes are to be interpreted differently. </div><br><div>For instance, we may stipulate that a code stroke that ie held so as to be overlapped by the succeeding other-hand stroke is to be interpreted as a Cc code -- and with the succeeding overlap code being interpreted normally. But this only saves one stroke, and at the expense of a break in stroke rhythmn. I think there is better use to be made of overlap. </div><br><div><br>A better use would seem to stem from saying that the two overlapped five-bit codes are to be interpreted as an independent ten-bit code. This gives us 961 unique codes for which to designate special abbreviations, control tricksj etc, and opens the door to a coordinated \"shorthand\" code. Phrases, words, n-grams (including spaces punctuation and control characters), whose payoff in frequency of use times 5-bit code strokes saved is large enough, would thus be encoded as single two-handed overlap strokes. </div><br><div>It seems reasonable to say that it is the order of keyset actuation, rather than which hand actuates which code, that should determine the way the interpreter groups the two five-bit codes into a ten-bit code. This would seem less distrubing to the character-at-a-time alternate-hand rhythmn in which the shorthand codes would be embedded.</div><br><div>However, it would be possible for the order of overlapping -- which hand was first -- to be of significance, This could provide two independent 961-code interpretive repertoires. It is also possible to say that no pair, the interpretation gives the same designater role to the aame hand every time. </div><br><div>The shorthand forms can be remembered and stroked as a pair of Cl characters rather than as a ten-bit code. Also this shorthand springs compatibly from the five-bit character-by-character code, and a person can gradually add new shorthand forms to his repertoire as his familiarity and skill grow. </div><br><div>c. More Code Forms Per Hand Stroke. I think that some or all of the fingers could probably control more than one bit per hand stroke. The pressure-sensitive pads (see CBC 4 OCT 63) will allow us rather easily to experiment. Two pads per finger gives five-level radix-3 codes (3 exp 5 = 243, yielding a 242-code-form hand stroke) and three pads per finger gives five-level radix-4 codes (4 exp 5 = 1024, a full ten-bits, yielding a 1023-code-form band stroke), It can be arranged that one finger can activate either or both of two pads, but this is equivalent to a three-pad, one-out-of-three arrangement. </div><br><div>It remains to be learned how best there different code-forms-per-stroke and encoding possibilities can be used, I plan to experiment (Judy and me as subjects) on basic feasibility of these different approaches, but it would require a fUll-blown project to explore and evaluate meaningfully. </div>",

A \"coordinated working system\" is the focus for planning. </div><br><div>2. Miscellaneous facility for handling documentation files can be shown, but in a realtively short time, we couldn't make too much headway on an integrated working system covering all of our file systems within the allotted time--that is, headway to have unusual facility in using them. </div><br><div>3. The area where it would seem we could make headway, in an integrated sense, would be in the programming design and checkout area of activity. For instance, suppose we concentrated upon the following: </div><br><div>a. Realmtime feedback in checking out and debugging. In FKT 12 NOV 63 there are a number of suggestions, but only three of the nine seem likely within a relatively few months: Items 5, 6 and 9, i.e. stopping operations at any point with flexible hard-copy printouts available and easy way of restarting at same point, an accounting on request of machine times with additional feature of being able to set time limits on runs, and a flexible choice of real-time traces with automatic dumping and restarting. Perhaps other possibilities can be assembled and evaluated. Will need to assess the potential state of our basic system facility for the months ahead in order to determine which real-time feedback processes are feasible to consider implementing and integrating into the working system. </div><br><div>b. Constructing and using process-structuring records in the design, debugging, modification and docmentation (for others) of computer programs. Without too much new programming required, but with establishment of conventions, terminology am procedures, we should be able to do some very useful and interesting things. </div><br><div>4. Discussion of some process-structure design-recording possibilities: </div><br><div>a. John Wensley has described to me in the past some notions about the tabulations and labelling that might be appended (automatically or semi-automaticallY) to the listings of instructions (listed in symbolic form). I don't remember the details, but I believe that he mostly was considering at the time the possibilities within the scope of aids that a human clerk could provide--but some of the aids could be made automatic. </div><br><div>b. In this level of work, with the instructions that are fed to a compiler or assembler, the record established within computer store for a real-time computer aided interrogation, or established on hard copy for offline use, would seem to offer relatively fertile ground for new conventions, terminology, procedure. For instance, listing of the \"jumped-from places\" (from what other points in the program could control have jumped to this point?) could be worth while. </div><br><div>c. A next level up in the records for a program's design is what usually is satisfied with a flow diagram. Len's recent memo (LJC 23 NOV 63) indicates a start toward a recording structure not dependent upon graphics. I should think that we can pursue this approach very usefully over the immediate months ahead. For instance: </div><br><div>(1) study categorization of segments (what is usually described in a process box), there may be more, useful labels than usually indicated by the graphical symbology in flow charts. Labels can easily be attached, in the text-character symbology we consider using, to fit many categories, sub-categories, etc. </div><br><div>(2) Not only categories of \"nodes\" of our processing neu.wrk, but the \"links\" as well might be categorized usefully. i.e. bes:ides categorizing and labelling the statements (what used to be in flow-chart boxes), we consider categorizing and labelling the types of links existing between different statements (or what used to be the lines between the flow-chart boxes). </div><br><div>(3) Find a convenient way to hop between the segment-level description (what used to be portrayed in simple flow charts) ani the instruction-level description (the listings of instructions). For example, perhaps the description of what a segment is supposed to do no longer is coupled as a co:mment that is :r:art of the listing, but now is removed to a linked position in the linked-segment graph (I guess I am searching for good names while I write. \"Flow chart\" doesn't quite seem appropriate. It really is a matter of a description of segments of programs and of their linkage. Linked-segment record?). You should be able to jump from a view of one form to a view of the other with relative ease. </div><br><div>(4) There are probably often good reasons for having higher-level flow charts in complex programs. I know that this is the case for complex equipments and their block diagrams. A set of conventions for establishing and portraying these different levels of process organization would be useful. Probably the set would be the same no natter at what level you would be working, once you had gotten above the first level or so. </div><br><div>(5) At any level, it should be easy to follow paths along the various branches and linkages. On-line procedures would. do well to harness light-pen selection of branches to follow. Off-line would require some indexing as to where in the hard copy would be found. the location to which this branch takes you next. Indexing in a common iniex is one possibility, but it would be more convenient to have, for instance, the page number associated with a given branching link listed right at the branch indication. </div><br><div>(6) If primitive line-drawing technique becomes available in our display (or in the hard-copy output), we may find it very useful as one type of record to portray just the network topology for the linked-segment record a given level. Perhaps nodes would be labelled. by some brief code--point with light pen to get a description of that node displayed for you. The storage-tube display might come in handy for such a network display, since establishing vectors by dot generation can be done economically if they don't have to be regenerated continually. </div><br><div>(7) Changes in the record at one level usually imply changes at the other levels. Potential automatic accounting done--if you have made a change at one level, the other-level locations where change is potentially implied could be tagged appropriately, or a central file of updating changes (potential) could be kept. These records of potential changes to be made could link back to the explicit change which caused them to be established, so that when you began you cleanup work you would know where to begin. </div><br><div>(8) Provision for hanging miscellaneous comments onto the recorded structure should be made. By both the author am others. Along with this could go a central file of \"annunciators\" or flags that you (the author) could review occassiona.lly to see what comments, suggestions, warnings, etc., could have been left by others who may have been studying or using the records or the actual program. </div><br><div>(9) The off-line techniques being developed now for composing and modifying text could undoubtedly be expanded to include the composing and modification of these various types of process-structure design records. Same goes for the simple on-line review and editing possibilities with the 160-A-only system we are developing. Also, the techniques for off-line designation of changes to prior records, and for the extraction, modification, and integration into new hard-copy records. </div><br><div>5. I realize that the development of programs for all of these capabilities is beyond the scope of the next few months of activity, but the planning for coding, terminology, structuring conventions (format) etc., would want to be made with considerations of the future trends of our system, and I think that consideration of these future possibilities is important to us now. </div>",

Anticipated requirements for nerw concentration on the recording of our thoughts and actions and for learning and using new skills are pointed out as immediately visible changes in our working life. </div><br><div>TEXT: <br>1.0 Introduction <br>\t<br>\t1.1 The design of our AHI research program stipulates that: (a) our augementation developments be put to work in a real-life working environment, within a coordinated working system whose evolution is the essential concern. of our program, (b) the people who use these developments within this coordinated working system be the AHI researchers themselves, and. (c) the coordinated working system is that in which AHI research is done. <br>\t<br>\tl.2 It can be anticipated that we will soon have early developments sufficient for making the first significant changes in our working system. This presents us with the problems of examining our system planning for the coordination of the anticipated changes, and beginning to formulate the structure of the system's developing evolution. <br>\t<br>\tThe purpose of this memo is to raise some issues in this regard that both present my viewpoint and provide the basis for continued discussion. </div><br><div>2.0 The Recording of our Activity <br>The hope that computer aid can significantly increase the working effectiveness of real-wor1d problem solvers (like us) is based entirely upon the symbol-manipulation capability of the computer. The help we expect to get must involve symbols that have significance to our work. To derive full benefit from this help we shall find ourselves making new use of synibols and placing new depemence upon them--indeed, our research involves the development of just such in our way of working. The most significant symbols to us in our work are those that represent the thoughts and actions of ourselves and the people with whom we work. In our augmented systems, we are going to make much more effective use of the records of these thoughts and actions, and we are going to develop many new processes, methods and techniques both for establishing these records for making use of them. <br>\t<br>\t2.2 One practical implication of the above, to our program's working environment, is that we must tolerate the extra labors of establishing the records which our experimental working system is trying to make useful to us. We will want to make this as easy as possible by means of computer aids and system procedures, but there will always remain the fundamental, unavoidable effort of will and mind necessary to decide what to record, how to express it, how to organize it, how to label it, etc. (We will evolve procedures, language, am methods of work that help considerably in these decisions as well as in the labor of transcribing into recorded form.) </div><br><div>\tI see no way of avoiding the burden of establishing these records, and of living and complying with successive changes in procedures, nomenclature, format, etc., associated with our own exploratory and evolutionary working-system design. If sometimes we get restless because \"our work\"--as we have been used to viewing what our work is--seems to be impeded by the red tape of our working-system methods, we must remember that it is \"our work\" to use our experimental methods to do our work.</div><br><div>\t2.3 Another practical implication--we are soon going to find a lot more data being transcribed into both ham copy and computer-sensible form and we need to accommodate this in our working-system design. </div><br><div>\t2.3.1 Some of this data will be generated as we have mostly been doing it--a hard-copy draft handed to Judy for Flexing. Some work is more urgent than most, and we shall need priority procedures that evolve. We are undoubtedly going to have more work than one girl can handle, and we must plan for increased capacity: by increasing our inventory of tape-punching typewriters, by incorporation computer aids into the transcription system (cf. the see-also items), and by increasing our staff of transcription clerks. Our solution may be to have transcription procedures simple enough that transient contract typists can be brought in on call to accommodate peak loads.</div><br><div>\t2.5.2 A different kind of data well become involved in increasing volume--notes for POOC files that may be considerably less formal than for instance our QDOC items or the programming codes. It may prove worthwhile for each researcher to have a dictating machine (portable, perhaps) into which he can enter working notes that, when transcribeda he can weed out, clean up, am organize quickly ani flexibly during his on-line working periods. </div><br><div>\tThe urgency for transcription of your PDOC entries will often be much like that associated with the coding sheets a programmer is working with during debug time--you will what it done right away s o that you can use it in the problem in which you are currently engrossed. <br> <br>\t2.3.3 We may well find that some portion of off-line work by AHI researchers could be done to considerable advantage directly on a tape-punch typewriter. With our new transcription codes most errors are easily corrected by a few strokes on the keyboard, and insert or delete in work can be specified rather directly. The short \"turn-around time\" thus obtained, for getting one's working data into the computer and being able to get back new-version hard copy or being able to work with the data on line, is likely to be very  valuable to one's working cycle. </div><br><div>3.0 New-skill training for AHI researchers. <br>Another practical implication from the foregoing discussion is that AHI researchers are continually going to be faced with learning new skills. Our research planning must accommodate this fact. It will be no seri ous evaluation of a new development if its test application is done by users who have not mastered the basic skills involved. </div><br><div>We will soon meet such a problem--keyboard skills. It seems unavoidable that every researcher who is to be seriously involved in our experimental working system must require reasonable typing skill. I would say that \"reasonable\" means at least thirty words a minute (equal to a reasonable rapid handwriting rate), without watching the keyboard. Training to this level should be planned and begun soon, as explicit and necessary research activity and expense. </div><br><div>I would say that use of the binary keyset has yet to be established as a basic system skill. I currently feel rather definite about its not being a valid substitute for typewriter keyboard skill. Later developments in our equipment, coding, and procedures may well alter this attituie. </div><br><div>Besides the psycho-motor skills associated with keyboards, light pens, etc., there will be conceptual and symbol skills basic to our working system. We must recognize the need to gain proficiency in these and plan for the necessary training. Procedures, terminology, and format we expect to have to learn in a new working system. But also we will face such a necessary skill as applying a set of category specifications. </div>",

BERMAN</div><br><div>Abstract: Tests and analysis to determine the best display selection techniques for a computer-aided text-manipulation system reveal that the choice does not hinge on the inherent differences in target-selection speed and accuracy between the different selection devices. Of more importance are such factors as the mix of other operations required of the select-operation hand, the ease of getting the hand to and gaining control of a given selection device, or the fatique effects of its associated operating posture. Besides a light pen, several cursor-controlling devices were tested, including a joystick and an SRI-developed device known as a \"mouse.\" The study was aimed directly at finding the best display selection means for our own text-manipulation system but generalizations applicable to other types of on-line systems were derived.</div><br><div>1. INTRODUCTION</div><br><div>This paper describes an experimental study into the relative merits of different CRT display-selection devices as used within a real-time, computer-display, text-manipulation system in use at Stanford Research Institute.</div><br><div>Briefly, we have developed a comprehensive on line text-manipulation system. We wanted to determine the best means by which a user can designate textual entities to be used as \"operands\" in the different text-manipulation operations.</div><br><div>Techniques and devices for display-entity operand selcction represent a major component in any display control scheme, and are readily isolated for purposes of comparative testing, once the procedural environment in which selection is done has been established.</div><br><div>An important conclusion of our experimentation is that this environment has considerable effect upon the choice of display-selection means for a given display-control system.</div><br><div>Our text-manipulation system is designed for daily usage, and our experiments and conclusions stem from extensive personal experience as users as well as designers.</div><br><div>To emphasize this, we point out that for two years we have been using the system for producing most of the internal memos -- and all of the proposals and reports -- associated with our research program.</div><br><div>This paper itself was extracted from one of these reports -- reorganized and modified by use of the system. See 1 (ENGLISH 1).</div><br><div>The format and writing style which represent an important experimental component of our research, are left in the form with which we work.</div><br><div>Statements -- be they subheads, phrases, sentences, or paragraphs -- are numbered and presented in hierarchical order. These statement numbers are one \"handle\" by which a statement may be grasped for any of the operations performed on- or off-line.</div><br><div>References, which appear in the Bibliography at the end of the paper, are shown in the text by a mention of their statement numbers \"see 1 (ENGLISH 1)\", rather than by the more familiar superscript notation.</div><br><div>The tests of the display-selection devices simulated the general situation faced by a user of our on-line system when he must interpose a screen-selection operation into his on-going working operations.

DESCRIPTION OF THE DEVICES TESTED</div><br><div>The tests included both a light pen and various devices to position a cursor (or \"bug\" as we call it) on the CRT screen.</div><br><div>Operand entities displayed on the screen are chosen by selecting a character within the operand entity (word, line, or statement).</div><br><div>The light pen or bug is first located near the desired character, then the SELECT switch on the device is depressed (or in the case of the knee control a special \"CA\" key on the keyboard is struck).</div><br><div>Grafacon (see Fig. 2): </div><br><div>Fig.2 Bug-positioning devices from left to right: joystick, Grafacon, and mouse</div><br><div>The Grafacon was manufactured by Data Equipment Company as a graphical input device for curve tracing. See 2 (FLETCHER 1). The particular device that we tested is no longer marketed under this name. Data Equipment Company now markets the Rand Tablet under the name \"Grafacon.\" See 3 (DAVIS 1).</div><br><div>It consists of an extensible arm connected to a linear potentiometer, with the housing for the linear potentiometer pivoted on an angular potentiometer.</div><br><div>The voltage outputs from the Grafacon represent polar coordinates about the pivot point, but are interpreted by the system exactly as the outputs from the \"mouse\" or joystick, which represent rec tangular coordinates.</div><br><div>This means that to trace a straight line across the screen with the bug, the user must actually move his hand in a slight arc.</div><br><div>We planned to program polar-to-rectangular conversion into our bug-tracking process, but we initially coupled the Grafacon \"directly\" (i.e., with this geometric \"tracking distortion\") to get a general feel for its performance. We found no evidence tha the user was aware of this distortion and never didwrite the conversion routine to eliminate it.</div><br><div>A knob on the Grafacon arm is moved about by the user, and is depressed to activate the select switch (added by SRI) associated with the Grafacon.</div><br><div>The Grafacon as originally obtained was equipped with a pen mounted on the potentiometer arm. This was replaced with a knob to better suit our purposes.</div><br><div>Joystick (see Fig. 2):</div><br><div>The joystick that we used was manufactured by Bowmar Associates (Model X-2438).</div><br><div>It is constructed from two potentiometers, mounted perpendicularly and coupled to a vertical stick in such a way that they resolve the motion of the stick into two components.</div><br><div>The original stick was 1 1/2 inches long; a 3 inch extension to the shaft, housing a switch actuated by pressing down on the stick itself, was added by SRI.</div><br><div>Two modes of operation with the joystick were implemented:</div><br><div>An \"absolute\" mode, in which the bug's position on the screen corresponds to the position of the joystick handle; and</div><br><div>A \"rate\" mode, in which the bug's direction of motion is determined by the direction of joystick handle deflection, and the bug's rate of motion is determined by the amount of joystick deflection.</div><br><div>Mouse (see Fig. 2):</div><br><div>The \"mouse\" was developed by SRI in connection with this research.</div><br><div>It is constructed from two potentiometers, mounted orthogonally, each of which has a wheel attached to its shaft (see Fig. 3). </div><br><div>Fig. 3 Bottom side of mouse, showing mechanical details</div><br><div>The mounting frame for the potentiometers is enclosed in a 2 inch x 3 inch x 4 inch wooden case.</div><br><div>As the case is moved over a surface (e.g., the table surface in front of a display)</div><br><div>the wheels ride on the surface and turn the potentiometer shafts, with a combined sliding and turning action depending upon the relative orientation of the motion and the wheel axes,</div><br><div>to resolve the motion into two orthogonal components in much the same manner as do the disks in planimeters or in the old-fashioned mechanical differential analyzers.</div><br><div>A travel of about five inches is required for full edge-to-edge or top-to-bottom coverage of the CRT screen.</div><br><div>A switch mounted on the case is used for the select function.</div><br><div>Knee Control (see Fig. 4): <br>  <br>Fig 4 Knee Control bug-positioning device</div><br><div>A preliminary model of a knee control was made for this research.</div><br><div>It consists of two potentiometers and associated linkage plus a knee lever. The linkage is spring-loaded to the right and gravity-loaded downward.</div><br><div>The user pushes the lever with his knee; a side to-side motion of the knee moves the bug edge-to-edge, while the top-to-bottom bug movement is controlled by an up-and-down motion of the knee (i.e., a rocking motion on the ball of the foot).</div><br><div>Light Pen (see Fig. 5): </div><br><div>Light pen<br> <br>The light pen used was manufactured by Sanders Associates of Nashua, New Hampshire (Model EO-CH).</div><br><div>It consists of a hand-held pen coupled to a photo multiplier tube by a fiber optic bundle.</div><br><div>The pen is pointed at the desired character on the CRT screen with the aid of a projected circle of orange light indicating the approximate field of view of the lens system.</div><br><div>A switch on the pen unit is used for making the selection.</div><br><div>3. DESCRIPTION OF THE EXPERIMENTS</div><br><div>The experiments were designed to test the various operand-Selecting devices under conditions similar to those that the user would encounter when actually working</div><br><div>However, certain features of the live working conditions were not closely related to the actual efficiency of the operand-selecting devices, such as</div><br><div>The need to enter literal input from the keyboard,</div><br><div>The need to designate commands, and</div><br><div>The user's indecision in choosing which display elltity to select.</div><br><div>We tried either to eliminate these features from the experimental environment, or to fix them in some standard way through the experiment</div><br><div>Two different kinds of display-entity \"targets\" were presented in the experiments: \"word\" targets and \"character\" targets. The target patterns presented to the subject were configurations of x's rather than actual text. </div><br><div>Fig 6: Targets used to experimentally evaluate the operand-locating devices and results of an incorrect selection  <br>a) \"Character mode\" operation showing the target (Middle X) and bug (plus sign)  <br>b) \"Word Mode\" operation. The target is the middle five X's  <br>c) An incorrect selection is underlined. The configuration of X's and the bug remain on the display  <br>d) A correc selection. The position of the target is indicated by the bug mark and underline</div><br><div>A configuration simulating the \"character mode\" operation of the system consisted of nine x's, in a three by three array, with the array as a whole randomly placed on the display. The specific target entity was the middle x [see Fig. 6(a)].</div><br><div>A configuration simulating the \"word mode\" operation of the system consisted of nine groups of five x's each, in a three by three \"word\" array, with the array as a whole randomly placed on the display. The target entity was any one of the five middle x's [i.e., any character in the middle \" word\"; see Fig. 6(b)].</div><br><div>The subject was given a series of tests with each of these two types of targets, and was to perform the following task sequence:</div><br><div>When the target appeared on the display screen, the subject was to strike the keyboard space-bar with his right hand, causing the bug to appear on the display. (Requiring that he use his right hand for both the space bar and the operand-selecting device made the experimental task closer to the actual on-line environment, where the user would often have both hands at the keyboard before moving to the operand selecting device. It also gave us a way of measuring the access times for the various devices.)</div><br><div>The subject was then to move his hand to the bug-positioning device being tested, and use it to guide the bug to the target entity on the display.</div><br><div>When the bug and the target coincided the subject was to \"fix\" the bug at that location, using the select switch of the bug-positioning device.</div><br><div>An incorrect selection was signalled by a bell, and the incorrectly selected entity was underlined in the displayed target pattern [see Fig. 6(c)]; the subject was then to relocate the bug and reselect the target entity.</div><br><div>A correct selection caused the target to dis appear, and the word \"CORRECT\" to appear on the display screen [see Fig. 6(d)]. About three seconds later, the next target pattern was displayed (in some new randomly-determined position), and the process was repeated.</div><br><div>When the light pen rather than a bug-positioning device was used, the task sequence was much the same: after the target appeared, the subject was to strike the keyboard space bar with his right hand, then grasp the light pen and point it at the target entity (with the aid of the finder beam). The subject \"fixed\" his choice by depressing the select switch on the light pen. Correct and incorrect selections were signaled in the same way as with the bug-positioning devices.</div><br><div>There were two groups of subjects: eight \"experienced\" subjects who were already somewhat familiar with the on-line system, and three \"inexperienced\" subjects who had never before used either the system or the particular devices being tested. The experienced group were given experiments to test the devices after a reasonable amount of practice. The inexperienced group were tested to see how quickly and how well they learned to use the devices without previous practice.</div><br><div>For the experienced subjects, the entire testing procedure, which was broken into two time periods proceeded as follows:</div><br><div>The subject was given a brief explanation of the experiment and the target patterns.</div><br><div>He was then given his first device and allowed to practice with it for about two minutes.</div><br><div>Next he was tested using this first device, in both the \"word\" mode and the \"character\" mode of selection. Thirty-two targets of each type were presented. 3d1d After a two-minute rest period, the subject was given his second device and allowed to practice with it for about two minutes. He was then tested with this device -- again, with 32 targets of each type.</div><br><div>This same sequence of rest, practice, and testing was carried out for each of the devices being tested. This constituted the first time period of the experiment.</div><br><div>During the second time period, the subject proceeded backward through the list of devices, begining with the last device he had used in the previous time period, then using the next-to-last device, and so on.</div><br><div>Each subject began with a different device and was presented with devices in a different order.</div><br><div>For inexperienced subjects, the experimental procedure was somewhat different:</div><br><div>The subject was given an explanation of the experiment, the target patterns, and the way the particular operand-selecting device worked. He was allowed to get the feel of the device, but was not given a practice period. He was then presented with ten sequences of eight target-patterns each, in the \"character\" mode.</div><br><div>This procedure was followed for each of the devices being tested.</div><br><div>Each subject began with a different device, and was given a different order of devices to work with.</div><br><div>The computer was used extensively in conducting these experiments: for presenting target patterns, signalling of correct and incorrect selections, determining the (random) position of the next target pattern, determining the short time-delays between a correct selection and the presentation of the next target, etc. In addition, for each presentation-selection event, the computer recorded the following information on magnetic tape for later analysis:</div><br><div>The position of the bug (in relation to the target entity) was recorded each 10 mulliseconds.</div><br><div>The times the subject hit the space bar, and the times he made either a correct or an incorrect entity selection, were recorded and appropriately tagged to aid in identifying these significant points in the late data analysis.</div><br><div>The length of the experimental runs; the rest periods allowed between runs; the order in which the various de vices were tested; and the modes of operation (\"character\" or \"word\" targets) were controlled by the person con ducting the experiments.</div><br><div>4. DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA ANALYSIS</div><br><div>The analysis software was designed to allow flexibility in studying individual performance curves and results. This software provided operator commands for scanning the recorded data on the magnetic tape, selectively printing out results, producing CRT-displayed curves of each subject's performance, and calculating certain averages over a block of tests.</div><br><div>Tape-handling operations, controlled by commands from the on-line keyboard, facilitate searching through the data recorded on the magnetic tapes. These commands allowed one to scan forward or backward by one 32-target block of tests (or, an 8-target block, in the records for inexperienced subjects); and, within that block, to scan forward or backward one target (i.e. one presentation-selection event) at a time.</div><br><div>For each target-fix, the CRT could display a graph showing the bug's distance from its target entity as a function of time. This was displayed as two curves (see Fig. 7), one showing variation with time of horizontal distance, and the other of vertical distance. The time-count was begun when the target appeared on the display. Vertical lines on the curves mark the time at which the space bar was struck and the time at which the target was correctly selected. Incorrect selections are shown as x's on the curve. <br>  <br>Fig. 7. Analysis curves of the experiments</div><br><div>Figure 7 presents two examples of these curves. Figure 7(a) shows a typical performance curve for the Grafacon; Fig. 7(b) shows an example of joystick performance in which the subject made several errors before selecting the correct target entity.</div><br><div>When viewed on-line on the CRT display, the scale of these curves can be changed by keyboard entered commands that independently change either the distance or the time scale. This time scale change feature was included because of the radical variations in the times, among various devices and various subjects. The distance scale change allows detailed examination of performance when the bug is near the target.</div><br><div>When studying a given target-fix event, the experimenter can, if he wishes, initiate output (to the on-line typewriter) of performance data: the time at which the space bar was struck, the time at which the bug movement began, the time at which the target was correctly selected, and the number of errors (incorrect selections) made. This software also computed and printed out the following incre mental times: the access time (from the time the space bar was struck until the time the bug movement began, measuring how long it took the subject to move his hand from the keyboard to the device); the motion time (from the time the bug began moving until the time the target was correctly selected); and total time (from the time the space bar was struck until the time the target was correctly selected -- i.e., the sum of access time plus motion time).</div><br><div>Finally, there is another command which causes the computer to search through a 32-target block of target fixes and compute (for output to the on-line typewriter) the average incremental times, and total number of errors, for that block.</div><br><div>The CRT curves of distance-vs.-time could be scanned with the on-line system, in order to determine where the subjects spent most of their time; how much time they spent in actually selecting the target entity after the bug was already positioned correctly; whether the errors seemed more predominant in one direction than in another (horizontally or vertically); and other such detailed information relating to individual per formances.</div><br><div>The numerical averages computed with the help of the rest of the analysis software were collected and summarized as experimental results, presented in the following description.</div><br><div>5. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</div><br><div>Summary data: Figs. 8 through 10 contain the bar charts comparing the various operand-selecting devices with respect to the time required for a correct selection. <br>  <br>Fig. 8. Comparison of the operand-locating devices for \"experienced\" subjects, \"Character Mode\" operations  <br>Fig. 9. Comparison of the operand-locating devices for \"experienced\" subjects, \"Word Mode\" operations  <br>Fig. 10. Comparison of the operand-locating devices for \"inexperienced\" subjects, \"Character Mode\" operation</div><br><div>Figures 8 and 9 are taken from the results of the eight experienced subjects, some of whom were very familiar with the on-line system and had used the devices often. Figure 8(a) shows the average total time (for all experienced subjects) required for a correct selection of the \"character\" target, with no penalty for errors; Figure 8(b) shows the results of the same tests with a 30 percent penalty for errors. Figure 9(a) and 9(b), respectively, show the same for the \"word\" target.</div><br><div>The 30 percent error penalty is an approximate figure arrived at by the following argument: if a user wished to correct an incorrectly selected operand, he would need to strike the \"Command Delete\" key with his other hand before re-attempting a correct operand selection. This would take about as long as the time required to strike the space bar when the target first appeared. From the experiments we found that the time required to strike the space bar accounted for about 30 of the total time. Thus we computed the time for the error-penalty graphs by multiplying the subject's error rate on that device by 30 percent of his average time, and adding that figure to the total time.</div><br><div>Figure 10 shows the results from the tests of subjects who had had no previous experience with the devices. Figure 10(a) imposes no penalty for errors. Figure 10(b) imposes a 30 percent penalty for errors, as explained above. </div><br><div>Fig. 11. Error rates for \"experienced\" sujects  <br>Fig. 12. Error rates for \"inexperienced\" sujects, \"Character Mode\" operations</div><br><div>Figures 11 and 12 compare the error rates for the various devices. Figure 11 shows the results for the \"character\" and \"word\" tests, as performed by experienced subjects (using four different operand locating devices); Figure 12(a) shows the results of the \"character\" tests for inexperienced subjects (using six different operand-locating devices).</div><br><div>These results indicate that for the more experienced subjects the mouse was both faster and more accurate than any other device -- including the light pen. Inexperienced subjects, however, tended to perform better with both the light pen and the knee control than with the mouse.</div><br><div>As mentioned above, the knee control was not developed soon enough to include it in the tests for the experienced subjects (where we included only devices that had been available for some time, in order to avoid bias). We did, however, perform a few individual check tests with experienced subjects, using the knee control; in these tests the knee control appeared both slower and less accurate than the light pen and mouse.</div><br><div>Inexperienced subjects found the knee control was the fastest device. Undoubtedly the main reason for this was that the knee control, unlike all the others, has no access time. (If the access time is subtracted from the total times measured for the other devices, the knee control no longer show up so favorably.)</div><br><div>Inexperienced subiects also found the light pen faster than the mouse. A reason for this may be that the light pen exploits one's inherent tendency to select something by straightforwardly \"pointing\" at it rather than by guiding a bug across a screen toward it from a remote control. This means that an inexperienced subject can become reasonably proficient in using a light pen with relatively little practice.</div><br><div>The joystick proved to be both the slowest and the least accurate of the devices we tested, in both modes of its operation (\"absolute\" and \"rate\"), and among both the experienced and inexperienced subjects.</div><br><div>It is interesting to note, however, that both the joystick and the Grafacon showed up more favorably (relative to the other devices) when used to select word entities rather than character entities. These two devices seem to perform better where fine control is less critical; they can move into range quickly at the grosser level.</div><br><div>There were some obvious defects in the particular devices tested. For this reason, and because of the very limited nature of the tests, we should be careful not to apply these results to the class of device used, but only to the particular examples that were tested.</div><br><div>Both the Grafacon and joystick suffer from a lack of independence in the actions required to actuate the select switch and to move the bug. By contrast, the mouse is moved by an action of the entire hand, while the switch is easily operated by one finger and does not tend to cause bug motion.</div><br><div>With the joystick the scale factor between bug motion and device motion was about 4:1 for a normal finger position on the stick; for the mouse and Grafacon, the scale was about 2:1. This may have contributed to the lack of fine control (and high error rate) for the joystick.</div><br><div>The rate mode with the joystick is very poor, partly because of the software implementation.</div><br><div>We used a nonlinear relationship between deflection and rate of bug motion (approximating a square law), and left too much dead space around the center position of the stick. This made large bug motions very easy, but too much stick motion was involved in changing directions.</div><br><div>In the experiments one reason for the very high error rate in this mode is that the subjects tried to \"catch\" the target on the way past, to avoid changing direction.</div><br><div>The light pen may have showed up poorly for several reasons.</div><br><div>The mounting was somewhat clumsy and the subject had to reposition the pen on this mounting after each target selection, returning to the keyboard in time for the next target presentation. This tended to cause hurried motions, and may have resulted in many of the incorrect selections made.</div><br><div>A second reason for the higher error rate is that for some tests the intensity-of the displayed targets was too high, making it easy for the pen to pick up light from an adjoining character. This difficulty could be overcome, and the overall per formance of the light pen improved, if computer feedback were provided, to indicate to the subject which character the pen was actually detecting.</div><br><div>We initially expected to find that the starting distance between the bug and its target entity on the face of the display would significantly affect the motion time required for selecting the target.</div><br><div>However, the results compiled and plotted to test this hypothesis did not show any significant correlation.</div><br><div>An examination of the CRT-displayed perform ance curves suggests that this may be because the time to move the bug close to the target is relatively small compared to the average access time, and to the average time required for selecting the target after the bug has been moved close to it.</div><br><div>Examination of the CRT-displayed curves (distance from target as a function of time) allows several other observations as well:</div><br><div>In using the Grafacon and the joystick (rate mode), the subjects tended to overshoot the target, losing a significant amount of time in changing the bug's direction and bringing it back into position for a select action.</div><br><div>While our experiments did not provide a measure of access time for the light pen, we found (from observing the subjects) that a good deal of time was consumed in reaching from the keyboard to grasp the light pen.</div><br><div>Though the knee control showed up well in its performance as compared with the other devices, an examination of its CRT-displayed curves shows that its operation is relatively unsmooth; the bug tends to move erratically, and it appears to be difficult to move the bug vertically on the display.</div><br><div>Our other source of \"data\" -- gained by asking the subjects how they liked the various devices -- reveals that the light pen, while operating in a natural way, does tend to be fatiguing; and that the mouse -- though it requires some practice -- seems to be a satisfying device to use (accurate, and non-fatiguing).</div><br><div>6. CONCLUSIONS</div><br><div>Some specific conclusions about the relative merits of the devices.</div><br><div>The operand-selecting devices that showed up well in our tests were the mouse; the knee control; and the light pen. These three were generally both faster and more accurate than the other devices tested.</div><br><div>Inexperienced subjects did not perform quite as well with the mouse as with the light pen and knee control, but experienced subjects found the mouse the \"best\" of the devices tested, and both groups of subjects found that it was satisfying to use and caused little fatigue.</div><br><div>The select switches on both the Grafacon and joystick tended to move the bug and cause an incorrect fix. These two devices could probably be improved by redesigning their select switch mechanisms.</div><br><div>Although the knee control was only primitively developed at the time it was tested, it ranked high in both speed and accuracy, and seems very promising. It offers the major advantage that it leaves both hands free to work at the keyboard.</div><br><div>The major advantage of the light pen appeared to be its psychological \"naturalness\" of operation in pointing at the item to be selected. This means that an untrained user can quickly understand it and gain enough proficiency to do useful work.</div><br><div>Weighed against this, however, is the disadvantage that the pen must be held in the air while it is being used. Many subjects expressed feelings of fatigue while using it for a prolonged time. To some extent, this disadvantage might be alleviated by a carefully designed mounting for the pen.</div><br><div>Observations about the experiments.</div><br><div>The principal value of our experimental work to date was in developing the techniques of experiment and analysis, and in isolating some of the factors in the design of display-selection means that are important to fast operation. 6b2 Any comparative evaluation of the different types of devices must be qualified to such an extent that it is not significantly useful in a direct sense toward choosing from among the types of devices.</div><br><div>What is important to fast, efficient display selection is the particular feel to the user of the thing he grasps and moves, e.g.:</div><br><div>Where he reaches to grasp it;</div><br><div>How it fits his grasp;</div><br><div>How the scale of horizontal displacement is related to bug motion on the screen;</div><br><div>How he actuates the select switch;</div><br><div>How much mass he moves;</div><br><div>How the large-motion capability of arm and wrist can coordinate with fine-motion capability of the fingers;</div><br><div>How he can rest his arm, hand, and wrist (or how much weight he has to support);</div><br><div>And whether, when he removes his hand, the thing stays put, returns to a standard position, drifts away (as our modified form of the Grafacon did), falls down on the table, or has to be put down or hung on something.</div><br><div>To make final judgments between display-selection devices, more must be learned about the desirable way to adjust and coordinate each of these factors. Then it must be seen which basic-device approach can best provide this.</div><br><div>Comparative comments of a general sort can follow these observations:</div><br><div>For the light pen, there is enough less freedom to vary the above-listed design factors (than there is for the other devices) that its probability of being the best candidate diminishes appreciably.</div><br><div>Any final, significant differences between best designs for joy stick, Grafacon, and mouse are not descernible now.</div><br><div>The fact that a no-hands bug-control device can allow both hands to remain on the keyboard is an important factor in its consideration. Even if its selection speed and resolution could not be developed to match that of a good hand-controlled device, what we are learning about the importance of smooth coordination between the different prim itive operations would make it a strong candidate.</div><br><div>An important, general conclusion from our tests is that the relative value of different schemes cannot be judged on the basis of their appeal to inexperienced users.</div><br><div>The net conclusions drawn from our work to date seem disappointingly nonspecific -- but therein lies one of the most important lessons we have learned.</div><br><div>This \"lesson\" can be expressed as follows:</div><br><div>Display-control research is important because it provides basic processes whose speed and fiexibility promise to affect strongly the speed and flexibility that can be developed for higher-level processes. And it is this latter speed and flexibility, for a human to execute tasks at a meaningful intellectual level, which is the goal of research in on-line working systems.</div><br><div>Thus, the display-control processes whose design is our direct concern are really important only in the way in which they serve as components in larger processes.</div><br><div>The value of our design effort then must be measured in the improvement it thus provides in higher-level performance.</div><br><div>To pursue this kind of development and evaluation work, it is necessary to consider the interaction of higher-level considerations with those of direct involvement with the low-level processes where concern is likely to focus.</div><br><div>Thus, it seems unrealistic to expect a flat statement that one device is better than another. The details of the usage system in which the device is to be embedded make too much difference.</div><br><div>Irrespective of the speeds with which one can make successive display selections with a given device, the tradeoffs for the characteristics of fatigue, quick transfer to and from a keyboard, etc., will heavily weight the choice among the devices. And these tradeoffs, and the possibilities for designing around them, are not apparent until after a good deal of design and analysis has been done for the rest of the system.</div>",

Well, this basically characterizes what we've been pursuing for many years in what we call the Augmented Human Intellect Research Center at Stanford Research Institute. Now the whole session is going to be devoted to trying to describe and present to you the nature of this program, but unfortunately or fortunately, the products of this program, the technology of it lends itself well to an interesting way to portray it for you, so we're going to try our best to show you rather than tell you about this program.</div><br><div>A very essential part of what we have developed technologically, as what does come through as displayed to us, and I'm going to start out without telling you very much about the program and just run through a little bit of the action that this provides us. So in my office, I have a console like this and there're 12 others at our computer supplies, and we try nowadays to do our daily work on here. So this characterizes the way I could sit here and look it up. Give me a blank piece of paper, that's the way I start many projects. So with my system, that's a good start. I'll sit here and say I'd like to load that in.</div><br><div>So...sorry about that!<br>So I'm putting in an entity called a statement and that's full of other entities called words.<br>And if I make some mistakes, I can back up a little bit.</div><br><div>So I have a statement with some entities words and I can do some operations on these and copy a word because that word likes to copy after itself. In fact there are a pair of words I'd like to copy after itself and I can just do this a few times and get a bit of a trail there and there are other entities like text, say after there I'd like to copy from that entity; point to that point, and it'll copy it, right, so I could get myself some material on my blank piece of paper and then I'd say, well, this is going to be more important than it looks. So I'd like to set up a file. So I tell the machine, alright I'll put through a file and it says, oh, I need a name. I'll give it a name. I'll say it's a sample file.</div><br><div>And I'll say, please output it. It says it did and then it comes back automatically with an origin statement or header, telling me the name of the file and the date and the time and who established it, and thereafter I can always do something. I can ask for the status of a file and it'll tell me that information. Very small file now, owned by me, last written by me, very shortly ago, that set another interesting data in there. So we've seen how we can start with a blank piece of paper and go to developing a file. This file is one statement with a few words in it. Let's make more statements. I'll say, copy that statement and lo and behold, I have another one, copy that one, another one, I can even copy groups of statements. I can say, after that one, copy the group from there to there, and it does. I can look at that and say hmm...probably goes off the screen.</div><br><div>It'll be interesting if I could ask the computer to collapse that. Perhaps to show me just the first line of each of those statements. Alright, please do that. So it did. This is one aspect of what we'll use over and over again through this presentation, what we call, view control where no matter where in a file we're looking, we can ask it to use any amount of a large number of parameters for constructing a view at that point in the file that best suits our need at the time. This one wants us to give an overview of the thing. So I'll say, well I have this, I don't want them all to be statement ones, so I'll just replace the word there...with a two and how about that one with a three.</div><br><div>Just to place to forget how to count. So I can look and say alright, that statements one, two, three and four. If I'd like to make them a little prettier; I can now, hmmm...<br>I can go to work and neaten them up a little, which I don't want, I always do. Oops...<br>You can tell that I have not warmed up yet.<br>I hope you can tell...</div><br><div>Alright...alright, so I'm going to lean it up, line it up and I can say for instance, other entities like an invisible string. I don't know whether that tabs or characters in there but I can say if I want to and place that invisible...replace that invisible string with just one character, not that character, that one, space and it'll do it. So I can look at that and say, I have files; one, two, three, four, five, six and I'd name them that way but that's usually a sort of a pain to do that, so I'll ask it to number them themselves and one of the views is such that it'll give you a list of numbering for each of those statements, and I can also open them all up or ask for them without numbers, however I wish, then I can output them.</div><br><div>So we've seen ways to work fairly fast with the entities of a statement in a file, create a file. I can delete that file or mess it up considerably. I can find...I was going to say I want to delete that word by accidentally hitting that entity instead, watch what happens. Sort of replaces just the whole thing, it's nothing. That occasionally happens where you say, alright, I'll load that file.<br>It'll come back in, as it was I last saved it, telling me the date that I wrote it, unfortunately I didn't save enough. Well, I'm through with this example right now. Let me go to a file that I prepared just after my wife called me and said, on the way home, would you do a little shopping for me. So as soon as she said that, I got my system....<br>Organized....</div><br><div>And made a shopping list, so...It's got quite a few items on it and if want to, I can see that, yes, those are numbered statements and I can say there're ways I can scan down it, like I can point to ten and say put it at the top and I scan up, I point to 23 and I got quite a few, and I remembered that's about as far as it got when she said, well call me back when you're ready to go shopping and I'll tell you the rest of the things. So let me jump back ahead of the list and I can do things like, begin to reorganize a little bit. <br>Well, I say after bananas, it's more likely that I'll take the carrots there and so carrots move right up behind bananas, and aspirin doesn't really belong there. I think aspirin goes after paper towels in the order. Well, pretty soon I would...I would begin to have a lot of trouble keeping that straight. So let me organize it by saying, um...<br>Just generally produce...<br>Alright, I'm going to try that again.<br>I entered a statement that says, hey that's fine.</div><br><div>Right there, I suspect that something is going wrong and I would call the programmer or the hardware man. And tell him; I made it.<br>Produce, I really haven't warmed up to this thing yet, so I'll say what produce, I'll categorize things. Let me look at it that way and I'll say, let me move a statement, for produce, carrots and I'd like to sub-categorize in it. So it moved...</div><br><div>There it is. I got...hey, that's what happened.<br>Alright, produce I've got carrots and I'll move under there also bananas.<br>And in fact, I could move a whole group under there, saying oranges and apples also...<br>So I can begin categorizing things like that and if I looked at the numbers now, I'd find that these...these items fit under there as a subset and I realize I can categorize quite extensively, I could introduce a new thing under there...</div><br><div>That was...<br>Something I just invented; skinless banana but I...<br>Have to go there...</div><br><div>And look at it. So part of our view control besides this thing we've shown you, of showing numbers or not, as also whether we can show you some of these different levels or not. I can say all I want is C 2 levels or only one level deep in there. That makes it very nice for studying it or I can do something like; when I say, let's put produce at the top. Let's open up one level below it and only show me what's below it. And then another level if I wish and then no numbers, so these moving around with jump to identities.<br>There're many ways to move around and to make views and this...this is one of the basic features of this tool we have. Well, suppose I work for some time at this and then call up my wife to get the rest of the list. I'd eventually end up...<br>With...</div><br><div>Whole produce, cans, cereals; what about cereals? Oh, cereals, bread, noodles, I like that, okay, back up there if I want to look at the numbers, that's what I can. If I want to open up everything, see that or any lines. There are many ways in which I can look at that and...but one interesting thing here that I haven't told you about, is that when the numbers are on, I can do something like say, sort of jump to identity and pointing to that and having it bring to the top or jumping return back.</div><br><div>I can say jump to a name and say, got to 2 A 4. And it'll do it or return, so I can jump to a location number just by giving it or if I wish, I can add it.<br>But there is another thing I can do. There is a route I've said I have here.<br>So here I'm afraid I'll need a different picture of the view.<br>So here's what I drew with a picture drawing capability. Here is a slight map, if I start from work and here's the route I seem to have to go to; to pick up all the materials. And that's my plan for getting home tonight but if I want to I can say, the library, what am I supposed to pick up there? I can just point to that and oh, I see, overdue books and all. Well, there was a statement there with that name on it. Go back, what if I, what am I supposed to pick up at the drug store. Mm...I see, very interesting. Alright, market; well, I've already seen that. Why did it snow like that?</div><br><div>Gee, that's too much. Anyway, so we have this feature of structuring our material hierarchically; being able to move around it very well; when we get a hierarchy...<br>Such as I can show you here now...<br>I can do things if I want to, just say, I'd like to interchange produce and canned materials, bingo and they're all numbered rightly, if I cared to look. Interchanging them very quickly; cans are going to inter...inter...get interchanged with produce. They do it and all gets re-numbered. So I have ways of studying over, making different views, moving around, going to specified points and modifying the structure, at the same time I've seen that I have a repertoire of different entities; like character, knock off that character, replace the character, make that P. So I have entities of all sorts that I can say, I want to do operations on, and this basic structure that I can move over and study and get about very quickly. So that is the essence now.</div><br><div>That's the essence of the tool we have. There're a lot of details that I've left out for you. And now I'd like to stop a minute and just make sure you understand we're shifting from illustrative material to the real working stuff. In case you wouldn't recognize it otherwise. We've had...we've used this tool to do our daily work and it's, our system has been built as time-sharing system for about six months now, it's been working. And in that time, we've gone from getting one console to getting about six working now with twelve...six more due with the rest of spring. This is our fourth computer, which we've had this kind of a system. So we've learned a lot about the user features we want and how to be fairly skillful, but this next step about learning how, when you're faced with having this in your office all day as I now do, very exciting sense. How do you put that to work for yourself? How do you organize your files? What kind of things do you do? So, to get going on this, let's switch away from the tool we have here and talk about some of the general features of the program, some of the ways it's built, get back a little later to the nature of the...of our usage of it. Alright, let me get back, this material. Here's just the outline I'm going to use. You can realize that it's a file. These are statements and we're probably looking at the top level of them and the first one, the introduction you can consider we've done and the next one, overall about program; it's what I'm going to do now. Well, I'm doing to do something called, jump on a link and the link is something that'll go between files.</div><br><div>So what it's going to do, it says I'm going to go to your file name at CNRO and the link also says where in that file and just what view it wants. So I do it like that. I'm in the middle of that other file, looking at this particular material that's been carved out by the specifications on that link, and this is telling me to make a preparation to start on our presentation but I should also remember...<br>I'm going back to this other file because what I want to do is restore.<br>Restore a different kind...</div><br><div>Alright!<br>I had to go to a different file on which...because I made a hitch in my rehearsing for this thing in which I have...have many types of format structures set up and numbered, and I just reset the kind that I want to use to show you this material. We're very flexible, whether for instance I can say I'd like to restore...number seven is a horrible example. See, I can have many ways in which I can control all of the parameters; character size, spacing locations, everything else but I don't usually go to this extreme, but just showing you that I can.<br>What I want right now is the one that shows you a simple large view. We usually work with a view...<br>We usually work with something like this. But when we're working with our close spaces, we can do quite well but it's felt that...that would be a little hard for people to see. So we're using it like this but we don't see as much material but they're larger and clear. So now let me back...go back to that file I came here from and say alright, now I'm ready. I'd like to jump and learn about the program. When I get in here, it looks different as it should. Here is the...</div><br><div>Here's...this is another file and in this file, I've prepared a chain of views and I...using some of the tools, I have it all set; it's like from one scene to the other. I could study them in the fashion I've shown you before, but it's sort of fun to set up these changes and it represents to you the way in which we work too. So to do it, I'm going to freeze a statement, it's named \u2018A' and I'm going to put on a certain parameter when I do it.</div><br><div>Then I'm going to jump to a link. Here is the link. It says you want to go to statement \u2018A' but after the colon, all this garbage tells a bunch of abbreviated ways in which you'd like to control the view when you get there. Many parameters as you'll notice, so I'll just say I'll go to that one and I'm looking at statement \u2018A'. Now it's telling me, this presentation is devoted to the AHIRC, natural question is, what's that?</div><br><div>That was another boo-boo I made. I left several statements frozen. This statement I've asked to be frozen, that was a set-up operation. It's just going to stay there above that dotted line as the viewing part of my screen from there down jumps around on the links I have setup. Okay, the first jump took me to this statement saying alright, Augmented Human Intellect Research Center is what AHIRC stands for, a hidden link will take me to the next one, telling me where it's located but in SRI, it's an explicit organization entity, what we call it group level. But also I'd like to point out there're other manned computer work going on at SRI and ours is but one. So I jump on a link. Incidentally, I should just stop and reveal to you that the link is hidden under there. I was very clever to set the viewing parameters so they wouldn't show the link, but when I say jump the link and mark it there, the computer goes looking from there on for that link and obeys it, and I'm not showing the statement names either but there's a statement named P obviously. So that program involves about 17 people together with the special laboratory facilities we have.</div><br><div>It's sponsored by government agencies exclusively ARPA, NASA, and RIDC now. And in the past, AFOSR and ESD and these were the people that first clubbed status many years ago. Alright, and there's been a goal oriented pursuit for many years and I think we can just go off and get a quick little picturized sketch to show this is the staffing over the years from 1950 on and has had slightly bumpy history. During these years, there was only one of us.</div><br><div>I go back to where I was and say, let's continue on in this file. That link took me up to a different file, to a statement for that view and I jumped back to this file where I was and now within this file, I make a link to another to say, the AHIRC is pursuing these goals, basic goal improve the effectiveness with which individuals and organizations work at intellectual tasks or does their ineffectiveness involve them, better solutions, faster solutions, solutions to more complex problems, better use of human capabilities. We need thinking about that. But a corollary goal is besides improving effectiveness to develop a system oriented discipline for designing the means by which greater effectiveness is achieved. It's very important to us. The approach for this shouldn't result in a system oriented discipline. Let me just show you how I constructed this file; you'll notice underneath there was that and that. It was just a link hidden here...<br>That went back to this view with slightly different view parameters...<br>To give you that view.</div><br><div>Alright, there's another one hidden here. It says the general approach for us, empirical but pursuing this monstrous goal, monstrously difficult to like building and trying empirically, and we're approaching it evolutionary-wise because we feel that it's a whole system problem, you need to get a person in that environment, working and looking at the many aspects of his working system that are involved in his effectiveness. That's many more things than just these computerized tools. And in a large system like that, we need to do it evolutionary-wise because we can't be analytic enough about it at any one point, to decide what best our next thing should be. We can only decide from here as well as we can analyze it, where we can invest our next resources to get the most return that will increase of the effectiveness of the system we have and this item down here is the term boot-strapping applied in a slightly loose sense. We're applying that to our approach. What we're saying, we need a research subject group to give them these tools, put them to work with them, study them and improve them. Ah...ha...we'll do that by making ourselves be the subject group and studying ourselves, and making the tools so that they improve our ability to develop and study these kinds of systems, and to produce in the end, this kind of system discipline. So it's going to...it's a struggle doing it that way but it's beginning to pay off. Alright, from there, sorry, I'm apologizing to my friend the computer. I said jump to link and hit it up here and it went and found these parenthesis starting here and so that's not a link.</div><br><div>I should have hit it here and it didn't find a real link and I'm back in this list here, and I've given you an overall picture about the program and that's out of the way and I can just move my marker down. And say, let's save that version.<br>So this tool in pursuing those goals, when our principle tool is this computer aid system. Let's talk about it as a system. There's a link sequence to jump in there too. When we talk about NLS, I mean the online system, a very general term. It's going to be NLS for many...many years, an online system that will involve...evolve. Right now we consider it to be primarily an instrument and a vehicle for helping humans to operate within the domain of complex information structures. Well, we...</div><br><div>What do we mean by operate?<br>Well, composed study modifiers, a place we started now. We know there're many other analytical things you could do but we want to get around, study and modify.<br>And then to further information about what does complex structure mean? We're talking about complex structure, I'm emphasizing structure because we say although the content represents your concepts, there's a structure relationship between that content entities that should represent the relationship between the concepts of human thought.</div><br><div>Alright, we know, we can't do that very well with linear text, so inside the computer, we can represent that quite well, in fact we can represent information structures in a computer that will generally be far too complex for you to study directly. But nevertheless serves as a tool to roam over that.</div><br><div>Navigate through a complex structure, able to find your way in navigating, move about it rapidly and be able to see what you want to see at any given point. It's how we think in NLS as a tool. Alright, these are all very important concepts to us because these together with boot-strapping have told us where to start. We start by building an instrument that we can sit at and work during our day, to organize the kind of working information we need as a task force, developing systems. We need to write our specifications, our plans, our programs, our user's guides, our documentation, our reports and even our proposals.</div><br><div>So we've been using these when we return back here and said I've finished that version and to help you keep track of where we are, and a little bit to help me too. We'll move that down. So having gone through these items, I'd like to come and now begin to tell you something about the implementation.</div><br><div>So I'm going to open up under here and talk to you about the control techniques, control devices, control dialogue and control mother language that we're using. Okay, to talk about control devices, we'll use this overhead camera shot, where you can see the devices that I'm using. I use three and they're not all standard. We have a plain device called a mouse, standard keyboard and a special key set we have here, and we're going to go for a picture down in our laboratory and then we'll park and pipe it up, it'll show you from another point of view, more about how that mouse works. Come in Menlo Park.</div><br><div>Okay, there is Don Andrew's hand in Menlo Park and in a second, we'll see the screen that he's working and the way the tracking spot moves in conjunction with movements of that mouse. I don't know why we call it a mouse, sometimes I apologize. It started that way and we never did change it. Alright, as it moves up or down or sideways, so does the tracking spot and the...the principles for this operation is quite easy to see if you'll turn it over, Don. Can you hear me Don, would you turn it over and we'll see you, right. Its principle is that, there're two wheels that roll on the surface. It's inside right angles and kind of sharp edges, one'll roll and the other slide in one direction. Each of it...each of these wheels controls through potentiometer, with a voltage output sampled by an ADD converter. The numbers taken in by the computer at sample times as to what the horizontal vertical...complements are to be, of where it should put the tracking spot and as the mouse moves over a surface, then you see those wheels either slide sideways without rolling or rolls in a motion that very closely duplicates the particular component of horizontal or vertical and the net motion it makes.</div><br><div>Alright, if you take a mouse and move it through some closed trajectory back to exactly the same point, usually the tracking spot won't come back to exactly the same place it was on the screen, and for that sense it wouldn't work well if you're trying to trace maps or other figures and diagrams. But the way we use it continuously and exclusively as to watch the screen and to follow it around, and we use this merely as a device to move that tracking spot and you're in the tracking spot, you really don't care whether it follows exactly this or not. In fact, we've had it at times where our tracking device, you had to move in an arc like that to make the spot, the tracking spot go on a horizontal line and people adjusted to it and would go like that to go in a straight line and wouldn't even know that they were doing it.</div><br><div>Other features in the mouse are that it stays put. I can lift it and replace it without having the spot changed, so I can adjust where I want it for my comfort, and these control buttons on the top are used by that mouse. Show you a little bit later how some of those were used. Now the keyboard in the middle is essentially a standard typewriter keyboard except for a few special keys out inside. The computer knows it instantly when you get one and makes an appropriate response. This device over here is unique to us and we always have to justify and explain it. We'll do it in reverse order. We'll explain it first.</div><br><div>It provides for you the one hand equivalent of what you can do with a keyboard. The five keys are normally each finger sits on a key and depressing any one key at a time produces a character. And any two keys at a time also. And in fact, any combination of depressing of which there are 31 combinations. So Don soon learns he can type a message...insert an I, C, select S, next...</div><br><div>It'll offer you a character if I hit W, it'll say delete word. The arrow moves back and forth to give me feedback. My tracking spot changes. That gives me feedback. Now, tells me since it's an arrow that is armed, I can do something. We get a lot of feedback. Let me restore, a view like this to show you. This is more normally the way we work with feedback up here, or here I'm shown; not working. That's an echo register that normally gives you the last six characters that you used.</div><br><div>Oops...not working alright, the last six characters and left shifts continuously so you can look up anytime and see what have I just struck, and that's very good feedback. Here, the characters show me the different viewing parameters, few specks. They get large at times at which I can add, hit single strokes...<br>That change those view parameters.<br>And each of those means something to me, and their being large at particular times tells me I can hit very quick abbreviation for changing the view. So I can say, I'd like to go to produce but I'd like...</div><br><div>Go to produce, they get big, I'd like to say, one branch only and let me look just that low and I see it. Oh, I can say, I'd like to see one line only. I can see it. So these ways I move around, the way I get feedback up here, the way I use both hands to coordinate to tell the computer what command and what sort of letters I want up, are all carefully designed to go together to make the repertoire.</div><br><div>We talk about the devices and now the nature of the dialogue with a kind of feedback we get from the computer for each of the discreet character strokes and actions that the user goes through when he's making, when he's executing a command. So that system is really represented to a user by the repertoire of commands he has, by the function of each of those commands and by the controlled dialogue he has for each of them. So they all together go in making a design and to do it well, you have to be very careful about the nature of the functions on that repertoire and the nature of the way they're controlled. So we've developed a very special language for talking with extreme precision about these controls, both the command functions and the control dialogue for them, and little bit later when we tell you about the programming, Jeff Wilson will bring in some special examples to you of the languages we've used, actually the program at high level, these functions and the control feedback that we get and these control dialogues. But that's why we're going to call the control mother language in there. Let's see how we're doing here.</div><br><div>Okay, let's move our little marker to say we've now gotten control techniques by us, and let's talk about implementation of our online system. I put over here a reminder when I jump to here, I want the view on below it to unfold in a certain way so I just told myself, hit those parameter specks when this is large and then execute and yes, I see that underneath, I'm going to talk next about hardware design and then software design and that's going to be done by Jeff Wilson from Menlo Park. Hardware design invited me to jump on a link here. Ah...ha...</div><br><div>See, it told me there wasn't such a thing as a link under there; bring me back to remembering how I should have gone through this, to go down another level. In hardware design, there're two features we want to talk about here, to bring out to you the way in which we gotten the kind of responsiveness and flexibility we need in this instrumentation environment. So way often Bill English file, those responsible for the design of all of our hardware. There's an outline he made of the way the controllers work for the aisle controlling. Now from this line to the right...<br>So that system [Inaudible] one time-sharing computer takes care of a lot of stations.  Let me talk to you about the display systems, the other aspect of the things that we've built on in here that are slightly unusual.  For that, I'd like to switch to Menlo Park, and get a view from the camera there and actually looking at the hardware.  So these are the units, it developed the displays, the computer constructs it right on a small high resolution CRT which you're focusing on right now, and in fact that's the CRT whose camera on the right looking at it, is generating the text view that's being typed down here on my console. </div><br><div>So as those are faded in and out between the two, you can just sort of compare them.  So that's very nice.  There's my mouse moving around in Menlo Park, my tracking spot.  So our displays work with those being watched by commercial cameras.  Look at my black bug.  Commercial TV cameras 875 lines scanning rates with a fairly high resolution; look at that, from now on to the display station a standard video microwave system.  Now if you back up the camera shot little bit, we'll see that we have a whole rack full of equipment here serving 12 of them, but you'll notice quite a lack of cameras mounted on. We seem to have stolen them all for this show.  So we're going to have several consoles at work right now because the cameras are mounted to give you these different special views.  I thought quite a few advantages; we use this particular display system, hard work technique, pretty much as expediency for an experimental system we had to build. </div><br><div>We originally were going to build storage to displays under here but we couldn't get them delivered a year and a half ago when we really had to firm up our design so we, as expediency wanted this. Ran has been developing some very nice video stuff.  They were kind enough to show us how these, these controllers now would work with videos.  So we went ahead with this very simple brute force way of having the video signal generated by looking at a small CRT.  Well, it turns out that that little CRT, its incremental cost, the video camera, the controller and a marcher total about $5500 which is cheaper than most fairly good resolution random defection display monitors would be, so we come out well on the price of the hardware.  It turns out that also that the cathode of the camera tube and in just black and white, you see it like this.  You can back off the scanning current, so that it's a sticky cathode, so it's actually, it doesn't erase the image on it by each sweep, it may take three or four scans and so it's something like a 15 cycle per second refresh rate on those CRTs, the camera, the one that's generating this as well as the one that we looked at a few minutes ago have short-term storage in there. </div><br><div>It's quite different from long persistence but gives us the flicker-free display here, quite a flickering display there.  There's lot of use on display generation hardware for 3 to 4 times as many display stations is otherwise.  You'll notice if we just get the text alone that there's a small effect by that bug smearing, but it's not that bad.  And that comes from the memory and the silicon tube.  Okay, so much for that.  I'd like now to have us bring in Jeffrey Wilson from Menlo Park, and we'll switch to his console, he's sitting at one just like this and working independently. Hi Jeff!</div><br><div>Oh...<br>We're not hearing you very well.<br>You're not hearing me?  How about now?<br>That's fine.  Okay.  I'm sorry you can't see everybody here; well, I can't very well either, because of the lights.<br>Okay.</div><br><div>I'd like you to talk to them about the, the way the special languages have helped in making flexible design and study available for us of the user features, the functions and the repertoire of the commands as well as the control dialogue for them, and then also it'd be an interesting example here because programmers, you programmers are the ones who most intensely found use for working online as we're building up.  Show them how you structured the...your system guide.  Okay?</div><br><div>Okay.  I think we can do that.  We can get sort of a good feeling for the way the whole system is put together by looking through the system guide.  The...the file is one that the system programmer sort of put together, help them get around.  You know, that's right now is getting to be a fairly large program.  It's not huge by a lot of standards, but it's getting pretty big.  This picture on our system guide file is a picture of the overlaid structure.  Our overlays are page sizes, so they're not too big in the 940 but, but each, each label in this picture names the code file and each, each one is 3 to 20 pages long, I mean 20 text pages if you printed them out. </div><br><div>Just to sort of show how user files like this can move around in the code and also how the code is put together.  As I said each, each label in the picture is the name of an overlay which is also the name of that file, but it also happens to be the name of a statement in this file.  By selecting one of these pictures and moving there, oh I was going to do something for you to let you see better.  What did I do?  Go back to the audience and start all over again. Bring it back, all the parameters.  There.  Now let me move up. </div><br><div>From the picture, I can move to a little section in this file which is an area that system programmers leave around notes for each other.  It's nothing much interesting here.  A little bit about the documentation and a fact space that's left.  Right from this spot, I can actually move out to the file.  Suppose that I were going out in that control mother language that Doug was talking about just try to see, for example the routines used in the delete word, or move word, let's go look at move word construct; I just select this link and here is the file.  This file is written in a, one of these many special languages that we've designed, so I've just moved down through it find the move commands, move...let's look here for move word...</div><br><div>You want to point out how you know it's move word?</div><br><div>Yeah, I was just going to look at that, Doug. As I was stepping down through that, I was sort of not only moving to the file but the structure of that, of that code is raked in such a way that it's a description of a finite state machine and so I was following the characters a person would type to execute that command.  Down here underneath it, I see that the routine is QMW over in the overlaid text letter.  So let's go back to that other file, move back to our picture again and find where overlaid text it is.</div><br><div>It's right down here, so we're going, sort of moved down through that one.  The, the text that is overlaid illustrates a lot of the different kinds of things that we've done.  This file has two major kinds of code in it.  First one is, many of these different special languages that we built up, see I'm trying to find QMW, that's right.  So, down here some place.  There we go.  See, two kinds of code.  This is still the kind from the other file but the QMW routine, the first sub-routine, the second sub-routine that it calls which is sort of interesting is move word, the word ____ I'm sorry, this routine is written in, in our Console Analysis language and it takes the text string and finds the definition of a word, what's after punctuation and it finds any special blanks around it.  It finds pointers that describe that word.  Another interesting one is the next sub-routine here.  If we look at it, it's in another special language that we built up.  It takes the pointers left over from the limited routine and the text and the file and reconstructs the statement after the edit's been done.  Let's see, where was I in this file?  The other portion of the file is, is written in a language that we call MOL, and that stands for Machine Oriented Language. </div><br><div>The, the MOL is a...in essence, it's a high level language in that it has great structure and good control constructs like IF statements and WHILE statements, but it's also very, very close to machine language, 940 machine language.  People talk about the actual registers of the machine and you talk about doing indirect addressing.  This language has helped us to write the kind of fast type code that we want, that we have to have to operate the time-sharing system, and at the same time it's, it's given us a lot of flexibility.  It's also the phrase structure of the MOL designed to sort of match with the broad structure of NLS, so we've got a WHILE statement; to see what's in that WHILE statement I can move down and see, it's 3 statements which is an IF statement...the IF statement is two, is a single IF statement which has an IF and ELSE part that the whole block opens up to all of that. </div><br><div>So by using the MOL like this, I'm able to move around very quickly in my MOL files, also able to sort of zoom in and out of things.  One of the, besides these sort of program organizational benefits that we get from designing all the special purpose languages, we've been able to design a syntax of these languages so that they shift with our linking structure in the conventions that we've set up in the _______ to help us in NLS itself to move around between them.  One of the ways we'd managed to implement all of these languages is by designing a compiler complier which we call trimeter. All of our compilers are written in trimeter. I'd like to add that we're really thankful to some people at Systems Development Corporation for helping us get started on lot of notions in trimeter, Erwin Book and Val Shaurie have been just invaluable in helping us get started. </div><br><div>By having all of our compliers written in a high level language themselves, we've been able to change them all the time so we're not only able to quickly modify the syntax of the control language for NLS itself or the meaning itself of the commands by, by working on a high level language but we're also able to go in and just change the compilers as quickly as we have to, to accommodate all sorts of new hardware features and experimenting that we do like that.  See in a system guide file, there're three sections.  The first one serves as program structure in the picture and those fast links we looked at were sort of aids that the system programmers have built up.  They just move back and forth and leave note. <br>Second section here is irretrievable, I think I'll let that go for a while right now.  The third section, more notes the programmers leave around about bugs, things that are wrong with our system right now, I got my blank line, well, anyway, one of the interesting things that NLS does, just an advantage of being online here is it keeps track of who you are and what you're doing all the time. </div><br><div>So on these statements, on everything, every statement that you write, it keeps track of who you are and when you did it, so not only can people leave notes around for each other but sort of automate it into how they, automated aids here that tells us who did it, when they did it.  I can set up search patterns; I think these probably will be talked about later.  So that's sort of summarizes what this thing look like and how it's put together.  Is there anything that I haven't talked about Doug that we're supposed to bring up? Looking at my notes right here.</div><br><div>You're doing very well, Jeff.<br>Thank you.<br>You've got to see yourself with a 15 foot face.<br>I'd like to...<br>It's great.</div><br><div>I guess I'll just turn it back to you then...I might add that if people want to come up to our room sometime, we're more than anxious to talk to people about languages and data compliers and all of the games the system programmers like to play.  So I think I'll sort of turn it back with that.<br>Well Jack can you, how about going back to that place in the control mother language where you start down the dialogue protocol a person would use. <br>Okay.  Right over here in main control...<br>Yeah.  And off to another file we're looking at real code now and there's a branch --<br>Yeah.  These top branches are all sub-routines that are pretty meaningless, in that WSE means, what case and it's...what's the person going to ask for?</div><br><div>So open up one level down now, right! Now all those things in parentheses that in NLS are the names of those statements, are actually in the programming language that works here, the way it's identified that's the character a user hits.  If he hits a D for instance...<br>A \u201cD\u201d here for delete...</div><br><div>Right there!  Here's a D that line tells you what the response is supposed to be that the computer is supposed to display certain material on top of the screen and then it's supposed to wait until the user does the next thing.  Why don't you term it to one line? <br>Yeah, I was going to do that.  Why doesn't my branch work?  Oh that's all that branch.  Okay.</div><br><div>EBT!<br>Well... <br>It's easy...<br>Okay...</div><br><div>I don't want to insult you by saying that it's easy to get under view the...don't ever say I, and if he hits a \u201cD\u201d and it sets up what it says there, you can now pop one level below it and that's the next block down in this special language and you see, well if after the \u201cD\u201d he had something else like a \u201cW\u201d it goes on from there to say what it is the computer's supposed to do in response. So this language here and its hierarchical structure resembling the branching tree of choices the user makes, specifying it at every point at what the computer does, the feedback and the optional choices and down on the end then specifying the actual function like leading a word, what's a word and what do you mean by lead? And for what's the word that specified off the subroutine he showed you and the special language to find in there what a word is. <br>It doesn't take a lot of programming skill to learn how to read these languages because they're at the concept level almost where the user wants to work. And so for us, in our experimental environment, our users are beginning to learn this so that we can look at that to find out how the system works and not at somebody's English text translation on specific domain.... Well Jeff, you did a great presentation, especially the last part...<br>Thank you.</div><br><div>Thanks very much.  Well I'm back now, I'll get my prop with my text and we'll go on to talk about some of the, oh no wrong text, right there, thank you very much.  Remember that we were talking about the hardware and software implementation, and if we go all the way back, we see that we've finished controlled implementations, controlled techniques and the implementations and let's move out our little marker down here and keep track of where we are.  We're ready now; I'd like to run through some of the ways in which we actually have used this.  The programming itself represents a very good example for me, where following from the basic philosophy that concepts come in structure and you'd like to structure your data base, or information base that way and have a tool of getting around it.  I think that the way we've got are records for programming organized and then the special languages using the hierarchy, using the names of places in there as labels of statements, so both NLS treats them as the name they can jump to, the complier that complies those files we're looking at treats those as the labels for those sub-routines and procedures. </div><br><div>It all makes a very nice way to study and integrate, and it's a very powerful, exciting sort of thing to show.  I hope people do come up to our open house and look at that.  Let me go down here and open up under usage and say first some application examples, user documentation is a straight forward sort of use.  If you were user here and came and sat down early, you want to get familiar with this file, let's go look.  Dave Kansas has written a user's guide, so down the hall and Dave Kansas' office in his drawer pulling out the file we go, and there you see it.  The top _____ was the sort of the outline.  Well I'm just interested in showing this very quickly.  You're, you want to find out the definitions of lot of terms.  It's sort of a glossary.  Well let's do the thing called the freezer statement and then open and say put that at the top, nobody hold that statement now, it's going to be frozen and our display scanning windows from the dotted line down and then we know about names and<br>jumping to name and so we can say, what's a bug? </div><br><div>Oh, down here tells you what a bug is.  I see.  Well.  Let's see.  What's a level?  Select level, tells you what level is.  What's a mouse?  That's fun to look out. There's a mouse, you can just point.  So you can set your point to successive terms and it goes there, the scanning window goes there, the frozen glossary stays and you can see the definitions.  Right now you're seeing some of the definitions you can recognize terms here.  That's a ____, maybe that's the name.  Let's just see.  Oh, it's showing off.  It's the sketch showing the mouse, the mouse buttons.  Very nice to have documentation like this and you as a user could sit down and early find a way round and find the definitions, descriptions, procedures for commands like that.  So let me go back to my guide and say the next thing you want to study your modified papers. Alright, it happens to be that we wrote a paper for these proceedings that's in the files.  There it is.  Top level.  It's interesting to study something like that, what does it have to say about user systems.  Go to there, open up a level and I only want to see that branch.  Oh what about file studying?  Open that up.  Oh specifications of former view, what about that?  Let's just open it all.  Now I can read it.  Gee, that's an interesting way to study. <br>This material was extensively organized for printing and printed out and it's from this file directly we print it out, printed it out on the form we sent to the, to the printers and these things up in here, these three letters and equals are special directors we embed on our text, so when the output processor does it, it puts in things like headers like this is make the head on every page ______ to abstract, that's prescribed form.  The number between lines, double-spacing, all these others have characteristics; you get line justification, page numbers, all kinds of control on there. </div><br><div>Alright, so much for paper writing.  Well, print out directives, I'll fill the rest of the time; I'm going to skip that.  That can show you a guide of all the directives for printing out.  If you were user, you'd want to go to that so you can have links to it. Joint file usage is something that is very powerful here.  I went off to a file that we were working on as we were getting ready in the early parts of this presentation.  And it was a message, it was something that three of us used a lot between us to coordinate the planning, task, contingency plans, the special needs and analysis for the fall joint and things like that, we developed a message technique so we could leave messages for each other under various user conventions and let me just tell you about that. Underneath here, we direct messages to each other that we can unfold and see, but many times you didn't want direct messages as much as you just like to go through and leave a message for somebody. </div><br><div>So we wrote down what the conventions would be...where's an example?  The convention that we're going to use is that we would send a message to _____, if I want to send Bill WKE a message, I would put that in the file, WKE from DCE, with that pound sign in between.  So any statement that's marked like that means that there's a message to him from me.  If I want to, I can say it was also for Dave Evans like that.  So that's from me to both of them.  I, we've this thing we call a content analyzer Jeff mentioned briefly, in which we can write expressions in the language, let's just come down here and look. </div><br><div>Here's a little expression in a special language.  That means I'm going to look for Mr. XXX a message from him.  Alright, what if I say I want that XXX to be DCE that's just some place in there I want to find a pound sign and a DCE, so we've got a little complier let me say from their complier comes back and says I did it okay and now I can say alright only show me the statements that passed the test that some place in them may have that string.  Here they are, so in every one of those that's from DCE, DCE. Go down and look for others that we're going to have here, this is to anybody from DCE.  Now I can say well turn off that filter, how about for so and so.  So can I say this is for WKE, a message for Bill?  The rest of this pattern here says that it's got be followed by any number of commas and letter triplets but eventually by a pound sign or it doesn't go.  Well, let's compile and see.  Okay.  Passed the test.  Alright, there's WKE, WKE for him. </div><br><div>And a dummy.  Okay, so it wasn't through searching.  Thing about time-sharing computers is that once in a while it gets a, it gets being asked for business from other places and the response we want runs into a fair amount of computation, we run into other people who pump us off to do it, and so sometimes it'll take a while to filter through all the patterns.  But that content analyzer, sometimes...</div><br><div>Now I'm disabled slightly because it seems to be hung up in the wrong place.  I'll have to run by the keyboard method, real _____ you know, I'm so used to working with one hand and thus I can hardly remember what to do on the keyboard.  Anyway, I want to go back to the file.  The other guy's that are in the time-sharing system are going to go and see why and I hope some hardware guys are too.  I want to bring in that file.  And the categories that we have to set up for these people.  Well, that means roles they're going to play and that they can play and what the open house duty or duty back in the Menlo Park during those two days are going to be. </div><br><div>This is a terrible...So under here on the roles, we have quite a few roles, somebody play just coordinating that knows NLS software, then there's time-sharing software, then there's display hardware, the transceiver hardware, user references we need to cover those at each session and we also say that these different sessions available.  Well let's jump down...Jump down and look at this duty rooster again, where are we?  Look underneath each guy and we realize we put a bunch of these code terms under there to say okay, that's Menlo Park Tuesday morning, open house Tuesday evening, Menlo Park Wednesday morning, he knows NLS and time-sharing system. </div><br><div>So these are the categories.  Now I can go back in using that, using that content analyzer sort of thing.  I can set up myself up fairly nicely.  With special patterns, like I can say here's a pattern all set up, so it'll say I want to see those people that are open house Tuesday evening.  So I just can compile.  Hey, it's working now.  I compile up successfully, I say, alright let's see it.  So it does, it says open house Tuesday evenings, Andrews Evans, open head, you have to forgive me if I slightly rattle when this thing started giving me trouble.  These four people are on Tuesday evenings.  That's very handy. If I want to, I can go to a view that only shows me what category I was filtering out and I can use another thing I call markers.  I haven't told you about that really before. </div><br><div>You've noticed that many times when I'm doing something to operate on some entity, that I use this bug to point directly.  Well it so happens we have a feature called markers such that any place in the given file; I can place the marker on the character and give it up to a three-letter name. Then at any time and any command, where it's appropriate to point and push this right hand button to say select, I can hold the button down and enter that name and let the button up and instead of it taking the character I'm pointing at with this bug, it takes the coined...it takes the character for an __ that I have named. Then I put that marker on a name.  So, __ at those markers, on patterns already set up for OTE - Open-house Tuesday Evening and such.</div><br><div>So I can set execute compiler from here and I can type in Open-house Wednesday Afternoon - OWA and say, \u201cExecute it.\u201d Says, \u201cI did.\u201d  Say, \u201cAlright, let's see what you've got.\u201d \u201cOh, Open-house Wednesday Afternoon. These are the people that are going to be there.\u201d \u201cOh, what about Open-house Tuesday Evening?\u201d OTE, Execute. Open-house Tuesday Evening. So these kinds of pattern matchers and markers and freezing statements and jumping on things, give us a great deal of power jumping around and moving, something I'm studying.</div><br><div>Right, okay, the other things to show here...<br>I forgot that I need to freeze here. The design documentation for our hardware and system analysis record...I'll just go very quickly through that. Just to show you that we use the same kind of structured stuff in the design of our hardware. We've here because of the design of the buffer register, and these are the different components labeled by comments and our language is going to digest this file and produce a wiring list. We can open up another level and see that underneath of these are all the logical equations. We can come in just as quickly as anything search, down, jump. Search for different patterns, jump on links, modify and put them out, recompile them and put them back.</div><br><div>Alright, I think I'll skip the rest of these because time is crowding us and I'd like to go to a little sequence here that is really a very important one. We have seen most of the way through here how this serves as a very powerful tool for an individual to work when he's studying, doing his planning, designing, debugging, documenting. We also saw through the medium of leaving messages for each other and filtering them that people can collaborate quite well over a period of time by working on joint files. In fact, you can have a joint file and go leave a message and get a response, in a matter of minutes, because they're all available instantly by anybody from one of these terminals.</div><br><div>But there's another degree of collaboration which is very important and which we're just going to be setting up in the next few months, the hardware to do computer aid. But here we're going to set it up with a little bit of people aid too. So, I'm going to establish a collaborative mode between me and another terminal. Bill Paxton's had a terminal back at SRI and the first thing I do to do that, of course, would be to say, \u201cHey!\u201d I'm going to...oops, to call this command, we have to go into the executive mode and set execute __ at a special level.</div><br><div>Oops. And then continue with NLS.  So that's a free demonstration of some of the versatility. Alright, special command. I'd like to link to Bill and I don't know what his terminal is right now. So I have to ask for somebody to connect me to him audibly, by audio. So Bill, will you come in through this intercom?</div><br><div>Hello, Doug. <br>Hi! I need to know what terminal you're on, Bill.<br>13.</div><br><div>Okay, I'd like to have him see my text and so, this special thing if I label 13 will switch over, so on his display he sees my text. So I'll execute it and sure enough it does. But what's that running around? Well, if he's looking at my text, he'd like to have something to say about it, so we put on a marker, a tracking spot that he controls, so he is sitting in Menlo Park, looking at this text and he can point to it, but we've carefully reserved for me the right to control and operate on this. So my bug is more powerful than yours.</div><br><div>But we can have an argument, yeah. Actually, it's called a bug fight. So, alright, in case you haven't been listening Bill, we've been going through lots of examples and setting up a collaboration here, so that we can go on into information retrieval. And we set up now audio coupling and we're both looking at the same display, and that will be very handy to work with. We can talk to each other and point and maybe later, I can hand you the chalk on this black board like saying, \u201cHere, you control it.\u201d But let's stay in this mode now and add another feature that hardware-wise is available to the kind of display we have. </div><br><div>I'd like to see you when I'm working on it. So, before I can do that, I have to set up my display in a certain way. Set it up, so I see it over like that. It leaves a corner up there and I say, \u201cNow computer, do the automatic switching and it will bring in a camera picture from the camera mounted on his console such as the camera mounted on mine is.  Hi, Bill. That's great. Now we're connected audio, you can see my work, you can point out at it and I can see your face, we can talk. So let's do some collaborating. You're silent.</div><br><div>What do you want me to say?<br>There's nobody here but a large audience, Bill.</div><br><div>Alright!<br>So, let's go talk about information retrieval and there are a lot of things I've been showing them, jumping around and finding your way, relating back to the portrayal I gave about NLS as an instrument on complex data structures. It shows them how we can get around and find things. I showed them the content analyzers, to help locate things locally. Okay, let's...you had a file kind of classifying retrieval stuff. Why don't we switch to it? Yeah. Good. Hey, I can't point.</div><br><div>Okay. You're on 13 or 12?<br>12!<br>On 12, okay!<br>You had executive...<br>There you go.<br>Where am I?<br>There you are.</div><br><div>Alright, now, talking about half retrieval, that's..., you're going to have to defend that.<br>Ha, ha, ha. Can you give it to me?<br>Yup!</div><br><div>Okay.  We've been talking about retrieval all afternoon, really, that's one of the main things you're involved in doing. Every time you're changing a view here, you're doing retrieval really. I've broken it up here into two main categories, the first where you have a known destination, and the second where the destination is unknown. These really present two different problems and there're different commands in the system naturally to take care of these two different things. Let's open this up. Take a look at what we have under here. Oops.</div><br><div>Good.<br>Good, both direct and indirect, the first where you're making an explicit specification and the second with an implicit. To explain what I mean by this, in the first case you're actually able to point at what you want, at the information you're trying to retrieve and move it into view. With the jump to identity command, you're able to point out at either by the cursor or by using a pointer as you've shown. Jump to name, jump to link, again here you're explicitly specifying by giving the name or having the name occur in the text. </div><br><div>For implicit specification, by this I mean, using information that's been stored by the system in order to specify where you want to go. In the first case, the information has been stored in the form of a memory of what you've been doing recently, so that you're able to say, \u201cJump to the view that I previously had.\u201d So I can say, \u201cJump, return.\u201d And it will take me back to the view, or \u201cjump, return\u201d and I will go to the view that I had just before that. Or I can say, \u201cJump Ahead.\u201d  And move back down again. Jumps referring to the structure, by this I mean the structure of the files, so that you're able to say, take me to the successor of this statement I'm pointing at or to the head of this branch, things like that. Content analysis, we've covered quite thoroughly.</div><br><div>Let's go on to the other main branch of retrieval that we're talking about. Here again, I've broken it into direct and indirect. This is the case where the destination is unknown and by this I mean, you don't know where the information is, but you're able to describe it or you know enough about it, and you can find it either in a hierarchy or by describing it with key words. By the use of a hierarchy here, I mean, working down through the hierarchical structure of the file, making use of the categorization that's built into the file. This, we've seen several times.<br>Let's... just as another example, to really make this clear, we've talked about the desire to get a hard copy of a file, wanting to get something printed out. There's quite a large system that takes care of making a file for hard copy. You're able to specify, how you want the hard copy to look like by giving various directives. One of the things you might want may be Roman numeral page numbers, so let's go off to a directive file, see what the directive is to get Roman numeral page numbers.</div><br><div>I'm into the file now, here's the first level of the hierarchy. Let's open up page formatting, we look; we want page numbering, so we'll open that up. We find, yes, here it is - Roman numerals.  We find out the directive, yeah, your bugs right on it already, Doug. Here's the directive we want. So we work down quite a way into a hierarchy, as you can see. This is quite a nice way to be able to very quickly find what you're after. Let's go back to the previous file now. Look at this last type. By keywords and associative re-ordering, I mean, the use of terms from a specified vocabulary to describe what it is that you're after.</div><br><div>Perhaps the best way to show this would be just to draw a little picture. The key words can be selected from a list...put the list over here. You can have any number of key words. I'll just put down that to give us an idea of what it is. Then we also - oops, spelt that one wrong.<br>Need any help?</div><br><div>Yeah, how do you spell catalogue? There it is. Isn't that close enough? There'll be several items in the catalogue, but what we want to do then, is select things out of this catalogue.</div><br><div>What does the R stand for?<br>Those are the numbers that are used just like serial numbers. That's my own dual decimal system.<br>Oh! Any reference three, reference __ or something?</div><br><div>Alright!  And then the K, I guess would be keyword, uh? How's that?<br>Ha, ha, ha. That's fine.</div><br><div>Each keyword then will point to various items in the catalogue. So the first keyword they point to those and then the nth keyword will point to other ones, and there'll be cases where they both point to the same one. When I select a keyword, I'm specifying that all of the items in the catalogue that it refers to, will be pulled out and given to me and in the cases where I've selected several keywords that refer to one particular item, that item will be given special preference and will be put at the head of a list. And then with that list items from the catalogue, we'll be able to use the other forms of retrieval and jump off and look at the items and then continue the exploration. Okay, let's actually go ahead and do that. I'll go back to the systems guide file. We mentioned earlier that there is a large part of that, that's concerned with finding things. <br>This is our documentation index for the NLS system. It's broken into the two parts, the catalogue and the list of keywords. The catalogue is just a long list that goes off the screen that contains links of to the various items in the documentation. There is actually an entry here for each procedure in the system.</div><br><div>This is the same file that Jeff was looking at, isn't it?<br>Right!<br>System guide for programmers to find things in!</div><br><div>Here's your same picture. Let me get it down here. There we are. See, the first part is the catalogue; the second part contains the list of keywords. Let's open that up. They're again categorized into the various categories that you would want to use to describe what you're after. Let's look at file handling and open that up. Here we have the list of keywords that we can use to describe things that have to do with file handling.<br>The things in parentheses, the names of those are the keywords?</div><br><div>This is just the name that's used to keep track of it. The keyword can be referenced from any place in the text by this name. Then there's a phrase following that - it's a little more descriptive. It tells what it's about. Then following that, there's a list of the items in the catalogue that are referred to by that keyword.</div><br><div>You're only looking at one line for each statement, so you only see the first few.<br>Right!<br>Right!<br>So now, I'm able to actually select the keywords that I want to use to describe what I'm interested in. I can do that just by pointing at it, and then it writes the word up here and another command to accept it. I can accept file control; I've already accepted file referencing. I'm able to...I'm also ...we're still on?</div><br><div>Yes, we hear you.<br>So who...somebody hung up on us.<br>How do you say \u2018go ahead' with a mouse?<br>We're on?<br>Yes.</div><br><div>Doug, you back? Doug, I can't hear you, oh okay.  So I selected several keywords here. I can go ahead and give particular keywords greater weight.  The weighting refers to how important that key word is in describing what I'm after. So, I can give this one a weight of two. Whereas this one, previously will also, will just have a weight of one. That means that the items that are referred to by this keyword will occur earlier in the selection when we're finished.</div><br><div>Okay, let's go ahead now and say, \u201cKeyword execute.\u201d This will go off and get the items out of the catalogue and re-order them. And there we have the results. Now I have...I can use these to jump to various places in the file. I'm still in the systems file. The item here is the name of the utility. So I can jump and get the information about that utility in the file, to find out various things about it. Go back to the previous view.<br>Now, if I want to go up and get the information, I just got to jump the link on this. And here I have the documentation on that particular procedure. After looking at that, I can go back again. And now, I'm set up again to go and continue looking. I can look at the next item. And here, I've got the results on that. So I can continue to proceed in this way, looking at the various documentations and going back and continuing to explore or you can re-specify the search parameters, and look at new keywords.  Doug, I don't know if you survived through that. We had the operator of the telephone company hung up on us I think, halfway through. You still back on?</div><br><div>No, I guess we'd better come back and I'm sorry I can't say goodbye to Bill.<br>Oh, I can hear you now.<br>Oh great!<br>There you go. You've been talking all this time?</div><br><div>I saw when you leaned over and hung up the phone for a while, so I couldn't interrupt you.  Well, thanks, I'm sorry that we're pushed by - pushed when we were trying to describe each of the features in this system. This particular one, the keyword, is very powerful and could very well warrant a whole paper on itself, because it gives us the power of keyword descriptive kind of organization but with the added feature of giving weights to the keyword, so the results of the search as you see right here are ordered, so that this one ended up meeting the most requirements and adding the most weight. And down here, could be one that only associated with one of the descriptors and the lowest weight one at that. So you have an order in this that's probably in relevance.  And then right with us are all the links, use that as a link to go off to the file to find it. This is a directory of the set of procedures. So here's a procedure, here's a list of procedures for those keywords he chose that all describe certain things about file handling and this will take you off on the actual source code. It's like Don Andrews wrote them all in his files, the name of the place in his files and the views that you should open up so that when you follow this and I jump the link, you just see bingo - the overall view of that procedure. And then, as he pointed out, instead of saying, \u201cJump the link.\u201d you can jump to a name within this file where these things have descriptive material about that too. So, I think for the software guide, it's very powerful. And thanks very much, Bill. </div><br><div>Very good, Doug!</div><br><div>And the combination of techniques for getting around inside of the structured software files and the way in which it is organized, the way in which a special purpose language as we've developed fit with the structure reviews, really give a very powerful set of techniques and I really enjoin all of you who are software people and interested, to come up and work your way through these. To have some of the software people there in our open house, really show you what's what by taking you through that. Let me see my text and I'll see what I can skip so we can get through in the time we were supposed to - like 10 minutes ago. Let me go back to that view. And...they're purposely making that dim, so that I'll hurry.</div><br><div>Other things we're going to talk about very quickly are the range of activities underneath in our program and I will just go very quickly through these then. A service system development and user system development would...to talk about those a bit only requires me to establish a distinction between those two kinds of systems.  Really, we've taken to splitting the overall main computer system into this dichotomy of these two systems, where the service system is what appears at the terminal - when I push button, this button, I get that response. When I do this, I get that. It's the repertoire of commands and the services that, that organization of software and hardware and sometimes people gives to me.</div><br><div>The user system is what's beyond that. Given all that, what do I do with it? What kinds of conventions for leaving messages, for using the content analyzer and for organizing our files? How do we use the links and the keyword thing, user system there? And this is something that is kind of  a new element in systems research that we're trying to establish whilst we can integrate that kind of user system more with the people's methods, the concepts that they use, the procedures, the skills - all are developed in coordination with the kinds of tools that they have.</div><br><div>Within our __, we also have an explicit activity they call management system where we're taking some project money and developing our own set of management tools to help us manage the 17 people and all these diverse activities in this complex system. So we are beginning to develop some of those and we'd be happy to talk to you about those during open house. And our forthcoming involvement is this __ computer network, the experimental network that's going to come into being in its first form in about a year and end up sometime later with some 20 experimental computers in the network. </div><br><div>And they hope to be able to transmit across the country, with bandwidths of something like 20 kbps, till 8 times of less than a tenth of a second, which will be enough so that I could be running a system in Cambridge over the network and getting the same kind of response on a CRT, and it may be that the people there, the next time they have a conference in Boston, are going to try this from there. The...and in that network, we're going to try to develop a special service to provide network information - relevant network information for people. For the kind of information it takes to operate such a network - who's got what services, what protocol I used to get there, who's up today, what's the user's guide, where can I find the paper that describes the system that so-and-so offers. That's going to be a very interesting challenge for us to utilize our tools for organizing and retrieving information. And last thing here is - just a little comment about - after all of this, what's the product that we're providing in this research?</div><br><div>Well, it's a...we're providing a sample augmentation system, the one we use, and not only that, it's an augmentation system that's provided to augment computer system development and beyond that, we're also hoping that we're developing quite a few design principles for developing our augmentation systems. And these, I hope are transferable things. Let me ...</div><br><div>I'd like to close and give you some description of the support we've gotten from the different people that produced this and to acknowledge that. And back in Menlo Park, we've got quite a team of people, surrounded by better equipment, that have been busy listening to us and trying to control and switch these monitors up here, where all the displays went, the cameras went for what's on use, the displays go here, so they can monitor the different signals and switches and send us, what when we want. Alright? And I particularly want to give appreciation of __, not only designed all of the hardware or even been responsible for all of the hardware and software development that gives us our service system over these years.<br>But in the last few months put together the considerable network of intercoms and video switching and controls and mixers, begged, borrowed, stolen, that would provide the show to make it come off like that. To the supporting staff at __, Martin Hardy, Roger Bates, John __, Steve __, who just worked very, very hard to make all of this work out. Technically, Dave Evans in coordinating this and in managing the open house we're going to have. Don Andrews, Jeff Lewis and Bill Paxton for preparing and presenting the material there. And beyond those two, we've gotten a great deal of support from SRI, general preparation support, Stuart Grant from __ Institute has volunteered a good amount of time to help us. He was in that picture of people there. John Dusterberry of Ames Research Lab was very kind, saving our life by offering us the loan of this IDEFO projector - that's the machine that's projecting this video on the screen. We were just bowled over when we found out what sort of a display we could provide of what we're doing, and we very much appreciate the loan of that. And Gene Warren, from TNT Communications who handled this, we retained him to come and help us __ at work and he's just been a tremendous spark plug, running around fixing paging system for us and fantastic instruments, has done a lot of extra work lately. The telephone company has done a great deal, beyond what they needed to do too to fix this up, once they found out what kind of a wild thing we're trying. And their video man yesterday was trying to help us out with phone circuits and all kinds of extra links.<br>A very interesting credit to bring up next is from another research company. This is an affiliate of Herman Miller Furniture Company.  And why are they connected with a computer show? Well, they've been bringing out some new office furnishings and we've been very much interested in developing the whole environment for people working in a different way and that means walls, desks, surfaces, console and everything.  We got so attracted to their line that they've started working to help us equip offices and study it like that. And one of their designers, Jack Kelly, came one day, spent a day working with us about our ideas about our control consoles as being separated from display consoles and ended up making this - on a chair that I can get up, move around, sit down and swivel and rock and lean back and work very relaxed.</div><br><div>So, I think this is a very exciting stage we have just gotten and in the Open House, we have a full office which is equipped like this with this type of a console that we're very excited about. We invite you to come too. And without being formal, I'd like to really say that I'm backed up by a really very tremendous team of these 17 guys who've caught the spirit of putting on this show tremendously and just done an overwhelming job of putting it all together. And by backing me all these years, in this wild dream of doing this sort of thing and they're all catching fire and I just want to tell them all right now, I owe them a lot.</div><br><div>And a very final credit goes to my wife and daughters, who are out here, to whom I'd like to dedicate this whole presentation because of what they've put up with over these years, with a husband that's dedicated in a mono-maniacal way to something very wild. And so this whole presentation is dedicated to you four people there. And I thank all of the rest of you very much for coming to the dedication ceremonies. Good day!</div>",

ENGLISH</div><br><div><br>SUMMARY</div><br><div>This paper describes a multisponsor research center at Stanford Research Institute in man-computer interaction.</div><br><div>For its laboratory facility, the Center has a time-sharing computer (65K, 24-bit core) with a 4.5 megabyte swapping drum and a 96 megabyte file-storage disk. This serves twelve CRT work stations simultaneously.</div><br><div>Special hardware completely removes from the CPU the burden of display re freshing and input sampling, even though these are done directly out of and into core.</div><br><div>The display in a user's office appears on a high-resolution (875-line) commercial television monitor, and provides both char acter and vector portrayals. A relatively standard typewriter keyboard is supplemented by a five-key handset used (optionally) for entry of control codes and brief literals. An SRI cursor device called the \"mouse\" is used for screen pointing and selection.</div><br><div>The \"mouse\" is a hand-held X-Y transducer usable on any flat surface; it is described in greater detail further on.</div><br><div>Special-purpose. high-level languages and associated compilers provide rapid, flexible development and modification of the repertoire of service functions and of their control procedures (the latter being the detailed user actions and computer feedback involved in controlling the application of these service functions) .</div><br><div>User files are organized as hierarchical structures of data entities, each composed of arbitrary combinations of text and figures. A repertoire of coordinated service features enables a skilled user to compose, study, and mod ify these files with great speed and flexibility, and to have searches, analyses data manipulation, etc. executed. In particular, special sets of conventions, functions, and working methods have been developed to air programming, logical design, documentation, retrieval, project management, team interaction, and hard copy production. </div><br><div><br>INTRODUCTION</div><br><div>In the Augmented Human Intellect (AHI) Research Center at Stanford Research Institute a group of researchers is developing an experimental laboratory around an interactive, multi-console computer-display system, and is working to learn the principles by which interactive computer aids can augment their intellectual capability.</div><br><div>The research objective is to develop principles and techniques for designing an \"augmentation system.\"</div><br><div>This includes concern not only for the technology of providing interactive computer service, but also for changes both in ways of conceptualizing, visualizing, and organizing working material, and in procedures and methods for working individually and cooperatively.</div><br><div>The research approach is strongly empirical. At the workplace of each member of the subject group we aim to provide nearly full-time availability of a CRT work station, and then to work continuously to improve both the service available at the stations and the aggregate value derived therefrom by the group over the entire range of its roles and activities.</div><br><div>Thus the research group is also the subject group in the experiment.</div><br><div>Among the special activities of the group are the evolutionary development of a complex hardware-softwalre system, the design of new task procedures for the system's users, and careful documentation of the evolving system designs and user procedures.</div><br><div>The group also has the usual activities of managing its activities, keeping up with outside developments, publishing reports, etc.</div><br><div>Hence, the particulars of the augmentation system evolving here will reflect the nature of these task--i.e., the system is aimed at augmenting a system-development project team. Though the primary research goal is to develop principles of analysis and design so as to understand how to augment human capability, choosing the researchers them selves as subjects yields as valuable secondary benefit a system tailored to help develop com plex computer-based systems.</div><br><div>This \"bootstrap\" group has the interesting (recursive) assignment of developing tools and techniques to make it more effective at carrying out its assignment.</div><br><div>Its tangible product is a developing augmentation system to provide increased capability for developing and studying augmenta tion systems.</div><br><div>This system can hopefully be transferred, as a whole or by pieces of concept, principle and technique, to help others develop augmentation systems for aiding many other disciplines and activities.</div><br><div>In other words we are concentrating fully upon reaching the point where we can do all of our work on line--placing in computer store all of our specifications, plans, designs, programs, documentation, reports, memos, bibliography and reference notes, etc., and doing all of our scratch work, planning, designing, debugging, etc., and a good deal of our intercommunication, via the consoles.</div><br><div>We are trying to maximize the coverage of our documentation, using it as a dynamic and plastic structure that we continually develop and alter to represent the current state of our evolving goals, plans, progress, knowledge, designs, procedures, and data.</div><br><div>The display-computer system to support this experiment is just (at this writing) becoming operational. Its functional features serve a basic display-oriented user system that we have evolved over five years and through three other computers. Below are described the principal features of these systems. <br> </div><br><div>THE USER SYSTEM</div><br><div>Basic Facility</div><br><div>As \"seen\" by the user, the basic facility has the following characteristics:</div><br><div>CRT consoles, of which 10 are normally located in offlces of AHI research staff.</div><br><div>The consoles are served by an SDS 940 time-sharing computer dedicated to full-time service for this staff, and each console may operate entirely independently of the others.</div><br><div>Each individual has private file space, and the group has community space, on a high-speed disc with a capacity of 96 million characters.</div><br><div>The system is not intended to serve a general community of time-sharing users, but is being shaped in its entire design toward the special needs of the \"bootstrapping\" experiment. <br> </div><br><div>Work Stations</div><br><div>As noted above, each work station is equipped with a display, an alphanumeric keyboard, a mouse, and a five-key handset.</div><br><div>The display at each of the workstations (see Figure 1) is provided on a high-resolution, closed-circuit television monitor. </div><br><div>FIGURE 1--Typical work station with TV display, typewriter keyboard, mouse and chord handset</div><br><div>The alphanumeric keyboard is similar to a Teletype keyboard. It has 96 normal characters in two cases. A third-case shift key provides for future expansion, and two special keys are used for system control.</div><br><div>The mouse produces two analog voltages. As the two wheels (see Figure 2) rotate, each changing in proportion to the X or Y movement over the table top. <br>  <br>FIGURE 2 -- Underside of the Mouse</div><br><div>These voltages control, via an A/D converter, the computer's memory, and the display generator, the coordinates of a tracking spot with which the user may \"point\" to positions on the screen.</div><br><div>Three buttons on top of the mouse are used for special control.</div><br><div>A set of experiments, comparing (within our techniques of interaction) the relative speed and accuracy obtained with this and other selection devices showed the mouse to be better than a light pen or a joystick (see Refs. English 1 and English 2).</div><br><div>Compared to a light pen, it is generally less awkward and fatiguing to use, and it has a decided advantage for use with raster-scan, write-through storage tube, projection, or multiviewer display systems.</div><br><div>The five-key handset has 31 chords or unique key-stroke combinations, in five \"cases.\"</div><br><div>The first four cases contain lower and upper-case letters and punctuation, digits, and special characters. (The chords for the letters correspond to the binary numbers from 1 to 26.)</div><br><div>The fifth case is \"control case.\" A particular chord (the same chord in each case) will always transfer subsequent in put-chord interpretations to control case.</div><br><div>In control case, one can \"backspace\" through recent input, specify underlining for subsequent input, transfer to another case, visit another case for one character or one word, etc.</div><br><div>One-handed typing with the handset is slower than two-handed typing with the standard keyboard. However, when the user works with one hand on the handset and one on the mouse, the coordinated interspersion of control characters and short literal strings from one hand with mouse control actions from the other yields con siderable advantage in speed and smooth ness of operation.</div><br><div>For literal strings longer than about ten characters, one tends to transfer from the handset to the normal key board.</div><br><div>Both from general experience and from specific experiment, it seems that enough handset skill to make its use worthwhile can generally be achieved with about five hours of practice. Beyond this, skill grows with usage. <br> </div><br><div>Structure of Files</div><br><div>Our working information is organized into files, with flexible means for users to set up indices and directories, and to hop from file to file by display-selection or by typed-in file-name designations. Each file is highly structured in its internal organization.</div><br><div>The specific structure of a given file is determined by the user, and is an important part of his conceptual and \"study-manipulate\" treatment of the file.</div><br><div>The introduction of explicit \"structuring\" to our working information stems from a very basic feature of our conceptual framework (see Refs. Engelbart1 and Engelbart2) regarding means for augmenting human intellect.</div><br><div>With the view that the symbols one works with are supposed to represent a mapping of one's associated concepts, and further that one's concepts exist in a \"network\" of relationships as opposed to the essentially linear form of actual printed records, it was decided that the concept manipulation aids derivable from real-time computer support could be appreciably enhanced by structuring conventions that would make explicit (for both the user and the computer) the various types of network relationships among concepts.</div><br><div>As an experiment with this concept, we adopted some years ago the convention of organizing all information into explicit hierarchical structures, with provisions for arbitrary cross-referencing among the ele ments of a hierarchy.</div><br><div>The principal manifestation of this hierarchical structure is the breaking up of text into arbitrary segments called \"statements,\" each of which bears a number showing its serial location in the text and its \"level\" in an \"outline\" of the text. This paper is an example of hierarchical text structure.</div><br><div>To set up a reference link from Statement A to Statement B, one may refer in Statement A either to the location number of B or to the \"name\" of B. The difference is that the number is vulnerable to subsequent structural change, whereas the name stays with the statement through changes in the structure around it.</div><br><div>By convention, the first word of a statement is treated as the name of the statement, if it is enclosed in paren theses. For instance, Statement 0 on the screen of Figure 1 is named \"FJCC.\"</div><br><div>References to these names may be embedded anywhere in other statements, for instance as \"see(AFI),\" where special format informs the viewer explicitly that this refers to a statement named \"AFI,\" or merely as a string of char acters in a context such that the viewer can infer the referencing.</div><br><div>This naming and linking, when added to the basic hierarchical form, yields a highly flexible general structuring capability. These structuring conventions are expected to evolve relatively rapidly as our research progresses.</div><br><div>For some material, the structured statement form may be undesirable. In these cases, there are means for suppress ing the special formatting in the final print out of the structured text.</div><br><div>The basic validity of the structured text approach has been well established by our subsequent experience.</div><br><div>We have found that in both off-line and on-line computer aids, the conception, stipulation, and execution of significant manipulations are made much easier by the structuring conventions.</div><br><div>Also, in working on line at a CRT console, not only is manipulation made much easier and more powerful by the structure, but a user's ability to get about very quickly within his dataJ and to have special \"views\" of it generated to suit his need, are significantly aided by the structure.</div><br><div>We have come to write all of our documentation, notes, reports, and proposals according to these conventions, because of the resulting increase in our ability to study and manipulate them during composition, modification, and usage. Our programming systems also incorporate the conventions. We have found it to be fairly universal that after an initial period of negative reaction in reading explicitly structured material, one comes to prefer it to material printed in the normal form. <br> </div><br><div>File Studying</div><br><div>The computer aids are used for two principal \"studying\" operations, both concerned with construction of the user's \"views\", i.e., the portion of his working text that he sees on the screen at a given moment.</div><br><div>Display Start</div><br><div>The first operation is finding a particular statement in the file (called the \"display start\"); the view will then begin with that statement. This is equivalent to finding the beginning of a par ticular passage in a hard-copy document.</div><br><div>Form of View</div><br><div>The second operation is the specification of a \"form\" of view\u00d1it may simply consist of a screenful of text which sequentially follows the point specified as the display start, or it may be constructed in other ways, frequently so as to give the effect of an outline.</div><br><div>In normal, off-line document studying, one often does the first type of operation, but the second is like a sissors-and staple job and is rarely done just to aid one's studying.</div><br><div>(A third type of service operation that will undoubtedly be of significant aid to studying is question answering. We do not have this type of service.)</div><br><div>Specification of Display Start</div><br><div>The display start may be specified in several ways:</div><br><div>By direct selection of a statement which is on the display\u00d1the user simply points to any character in the statement, using the mouse.</div><br><div>If the desired display start is not on the display, it may be selected in directly if it bears a \"marker.\"</div><br><div>Markers are normally invisible. A marker has a name of up to five characters, and is attached to a character of the text. Referring to the marker by name (while holding down a special button) is exactly equivalent to pointing to the character with the mouse.</div><br><div>The control procedures make it extremely quick and easy to fix and call markers.</div><br><div>By furnishing either the name or the location number of the statement, which can be done in either of two basic way:</div><br><div>Typing from the keyboard</div><br><div>Selecting an occurrence of the name or number in the text. This may be done either directly or via an in direct marker selection.</div><br><div>After identifying a statement by one of the above means, the user may request to be taken directly there for his next view. Alternately, he may request instead that he be taken to some statement bearing a specified structure relationship to the one specifically identified. For instance, when the user identifies Statement 3E4 by one of the above means (assume it to be a member of the list 3E1 through 3E7), he may ask to be taken to</div><br><div>Its successor, i.e., Statement 3E5</div><br><div>Its predecessor, i.e., Statement 3E3</div><br><div>Its list tail, i.e., Statement 3E7</div><br><div>Its list head, i.e., Statement 3E1</div><br><div>Its list source, i.e., Statement 3E</div><br><div>Its subhead, i.e., Statement 3E4A</div><br><div>Besides being taken to an explicitly identified statement, a user may ask to go to the first statement in the file (or the next after the current location) that contains a specified word or string of char acters.</div><br><div>He may specify the search string by typing it in, by direct (mouse) selection, or by indirect (marker) selection.</div><br><div>Specification of Form of View</div><br><div>The \"normal\" view beginning at a given location is like a frame cut out from a long scroll upon which the hierarchical set of statements is printed in sequential order. Such a view is displayed in Figure 1.</div><br><div>Otherwise, three independently variable view-specification conditions may be applied to the construction of the displayed view: level clipping, line truncation, and content filtering. The view is simultaneous ly affected by all three of these.</div><br><div>Level: Given a specified level parameter, L (L 1, 2, ...., ALL), the view generator will display only those statements whose \"depth\" is less than or equal to L. (For example, Statement 3E4 is third level, 3E second, 4B2C1 fifth, etc.) Thus it is possible to see only first level statements, or only first-, second-, and third level statements, for example.</div><br><div>Truncation: Given a specified truncation parameter, T (T = 1, 2, ..., ALL), the view generator will show only the first T lines of each statement being displayed.</div><br><div>Content: Given a specification for desired content (written in a special high-level content-analysis language) the view generator optionally can be directed to display only those statements that have the specified content.</div><br><div>One can specify simple strings, or logical combinations thereof, or such things as having the word \"memory\" within four words of the word \"alloca tion.\"</div><br><div>Content specifications are written as text, anywhere in the file. Thus the full power of the system may be used for composing and modifying them.</div><br><div>Any one content specification can then be chosen for application (by select ing it directly or indirectly). It is compiled immediately to produce a machine code content-analysis routine, which is then ready to \"filter\" statements for the view generator.</div><br><div>In addition, the following format features of the display may be independently varied: indentation of statements accord ing to level, suppression of location num bers and/or names of statements, and separation of statements by blank lines.</div><br><div>The user controls these view specifications by means of brief, mnemonic character codes. A skilled user will readjust his view to suit immediate needs very quickly and frequently; for example, he may change level and truncation settings several times in as many seconds.</div><br><div>\"Freezing\" Statements</div><br><div>One may also pre-empt an arbitrary amount of the upper portion of the screen for holding a collection of \"frozen\" statements. The remaining lower portion is treated as a reduced-size scanning frame, and the view generator follows the same rules for filling it as described above.</div><br><div>The frozen statements may be independently chosen or dismissed, each may have line truncation independent of the rest, and the order in which they are displayed is arbitrary and readily changed. Any screen-select operand for any command may be selected from any portion of the display (including the frozen statements) .</div><br><div>Examples</div><br><div>Figures 3 and 4 show views generated from the same starting point with different level-clipping parameters. This example happens to be of a program written in our Machine-Oriented language (MOL, see below). </div><br><div>Figure 3 -- View of Part of an MOL Program, Level parameter = 2, truncation parameter = 1</div><br><div>Figure 4 -- Same Program as Figure 3, but with with level parameter changed to ALL. <br>3d5b Figure 5, demonstrates the freezing feature with a view of a program (the same one shown in Figure 8) written in our Control Metalanguage (CML, see below). Statemente 3C, 3C2, 2B, 2Bl, 2B2, 2B3, and 2B4 are frozen, and statements from 2J on are shown normally with L = 3, T = 1. </div><br><div>Figure 5 -- View of a CML Program, showing the frozen statements and illustrating use of reference hopping</div><br><div><br>The freezing here was used to hold for simultaneous view four different functionally related process descriptions. The subroutines (+BUG1SPEC) and (+ WAIT were located by use of the hop-to-name feature described above.</div><br><div>File Modification</div><br><div>Here we use a standard set of editing operations, specifying with each operation a particular type of text entity.</div><br><div>Operations: Delete, Insert, Replace, Move, Copy.</div><br><div>Entities (within text of statements): Character, Text (arbitrary strings), Word, Visible (print string), Invisible (gap string) .</div><br><div>Entities (for structure manipulation): Statement, Branch (statement plus all substructure), Group (sublist of branches), Plex (complete list of branches).</div><br><div>Structure may also be modified by joining statements, or breaking a statement into two at a specified point.</div><br><div>Generally, an operation and an entity make up a command, such as \"Delete Word.\" To specify the command, the user types the first letter of each word in the command: thus \"DW\" specifies \"Delete Word.\" There are occasional cases where a third word is used or where the first letter cannot be used because of ambiguities.</div><br><div>File Output</div><br><div>Files may be sent to any of a number of different output devices to produce hardcopy\u00d1an upper/lower-case line printer, anon-line high-quality typewriter, or paper tape to drive various typewriters.</div><br><div>In future it will be possible to send files via magnetic tape to an off-line CRT-to-film system from which we can produce Xerox prints, Multilith masters, or microform records.</div><br><div>Flexible format control may be exercised in this process by means of specially coded directives embedded in the files\u00d1running headers, page numbering, line lengths, line centering, suppression of location numbers, indenting, right justification (hyphenless), etc., are controllable features.</div><br><div>Compiling and Debugging</div><br><div>Source-code files written in any of our compiler languages (see below), or in the SDS 940 assembly language (ARPAS, in which our compiler output is produced) may be compiled under on-line control. For debugging, we have made a trivial addition to the SDS 940's DDT loader-debugger so as to operate it from the CRT displays. Though it was designed to operate from a Teletype terminal, this system gains a great deal in speed and power by merely showing with a display the last 26 lines of what would have been on the Teletype output.</div><br><div>Calculating</div><br><div>The same small innovation as mentioned above for DDT enables us to use the CAL system from a display terminal.</div><br><div>Conferencing</div><br><div>We have set up a room specially equipped for on-line conferencing. Six displays are arranged in the center of a square table (see Figure 6) so that each of twenty participants has good visibility. One participant controls the system, and all displays show the same view. The other participants have mice that control a large arrrow on the screen, for use as a pointer (with no control function). <br>  <br>FIGURE 6--On-line conference arrangement</div><br><div>As a quick means of finding and display ing (with appropriate forms of view) any desired material from a very large collection, this system is a powerful aid to presentation and review conferences.</div><br><div>We are also experimenting with it in project meetings, using it not only to keep track of agenda items and changes but also to log progress notes, action notes, etc. The review aid is of course highly useful here also.</div><br><div>We are anxious to see what special conventions and procedures will evolve to allow us to harness a number of independent consoles within a conference group. This obviously has considerable potential. <br> </div><br><div>SERVICE-SYSTEM SOFTWARE</div><br><div>The User's Control Laguage</div><br><div>Consider the service a user gets from the computer to be in the form of discrete operations--i. e., the execution of individual \"service functions\" from a repertoire comprising a \"service system.\"</div><br><div>Examples of service functions are deleting a word, replacing a character, hopping to a name, etc.</div><br><div>Associated with each function of this repertoire is a \"control-dialogue procedure.\" This procedure involves selecting a service function from the repertoire, setting up the necessary parameter designations for a particular application, recovering from user errors, and calling for the execution of the function.</div><br><div>The procedure is made up of the sequence of keystrokes, select actions, etc. made by the user, together with the interspersed feedback messages from the computer.</div><br><div>The repertoire of service functions, together with their control-dialogue procedures, constitutes the user's \"control language.\" This is a language for a \"master-slave\" dialogue, enabling the user to control application of the computer's capabilities to his own service.</div><br><div>It seems clear that significant augmentation of one's intellectual effectiveness from the harnessing of computer services will require development of a broad and sophisticated control-language vocabulary.</div><br><div>It follows that the evolution of such a control language is a very important part of augmentation-system research.</div><br><div>For the designer of user systems, it is important to have good means for specifying the nature of the functions and their respec tive control-dialogue procedures, so that a design specification will be</div><br><div>Concise, so that its essential features are easily seen</div><br><div>Unambiguous, so that questions about the design may be answered clearly</div><br><div>Canonical, so that information is easily located</div><br><div>Natural, so that the form of the de scription fits the conceptual frame of the design</div><br><div>Easy to compose, study, and modify, so that the process of evolutionary design can be facilitated.</div><br><div>It is also important for the user to have a description of the service functions and their control-dialogue procedures.</div><br><div>The description must again be concise, unambiguous, canonical, and natural; furthermore, it must be accurate, in that everything relevant to the user about the service functions and their control-dialogue procedures is described, and everything described actually works as indicated.</div><br><div>State-Chart Representation of Control-Language Design</div><br><div>Figure 7 shows a charting method that was used in earlier stages of our work for designing and specifying the control-pro cedure portions of the control language. Even though limited to describing only the control-dialogue procedures, this representation nonetheless served very well and led us to develop the successive techniques described below.</div><br><div>Figure 7 shows actual control procedures for four service functions from the repertoire of an interactive system: Delete Word, Delete Text, Place Up Statement, and Forward Statement.</div><br><div>The boxes contain abbreviated descriptions of relevant display-feedback conditions, representing the intermediate states between successive user actions. Both to illustrate how the charting conventions are used and to give some feeling for the dynamics of our user-system con trol procedures, we describe briefly below both the chart symbols and the associated display-feedback conventions that we have developed.</div><br><div>The writing at the top of each box indicates what is to be shown as \"command feedback\" at the top of the display (see Figures 3, 4 and 5).</div><br><div>An uparrow sometimes appears under the first character of one of the words of Command Feedback.</div><br><div>This indicates to the user that the next character he types will be interpreted as designating a new term to replace that being pointed to--no uparrow under Command Feedback signifies that keyboard ac tion will not affect the command designation.</div><br><div>\"Entity\" represents the entity word (i.e., \"character,\" \"word, \"statement,\" etc.) that was last used as part of a fully specified command.</div><br><div>The computer often \"offers\" the user an entity option.</div><br><div>The circle in the box indicates the character to be used for the \"bug\" (the tracking spot), which alternates between the characters uparrow and plus.</div><br><div>The uparrow indicates that a select action is appropriate, and the plus indicates that a select action is inappropriate.</div><br><div>The string of X's, with under lines, indicates that the selected char acters are to be underlined as a means of showing the user what the computer thinks he has selected.</div><br><div>There is frequently an X on the output line from a box on the chart. This indicates that the computer is to wait until the user has made another action.</div><br><div>After this next action, the computer follows a branching path, depending upon what the action was (as indicated on the chart) to reach another state-description box or one of the function-execution processes.</div><br><div>The Control Metalanguage</div><br><div>In search for an improvement over the state chart, we looked for the following special features, as well as the general features ted above:</div><br><div>A representational form using structural text so as to harness the power of our on-line text-manipulation techniques for composing, studying, and modifying our designs.</div><br><div>A form that would allow us to specify the service functions as well as the control dialogue procedures.</div><br><div>A form such that a design-description file could be translated by a computer program into the actual implementation of the control language.</div><br><div>Using our Tree Meta compiler-compiler (described below), we have developed a next step forward in our means of designing, specifying, implementing and documenting our on-line control languages. The result is called \"Control Metalanguage\" (CML).</div><br><div>Figure 8 shows a portion of the description for the current control language, written in Control Metalanguage.</div><br><div>This language is the means for describing both the service functions and their control-dialogue procedures.</div><br><div>The Control Metalanguage Translator (CMLT) can process a file containing such a description, to produce a corresponding version of an interactive system which responds to user actions exactly as described in the file.</div><br><div>There is a strong correspondence between the conventions for representing the control procedures in Control Metalanguage and in the state chart, as a comparison of Figures 8 and 7 will reveal.</div><br><div>The particular example printed out for Figure 8 was chosen because it specifies some of the same procedures as in Figure 7.</div><br><div>For instance, the steps of display feedback states, leading to execution of the \"Delete Word\" function, can readily be followed in the state chart.</div><br><div>The steps are produced by the user typing \"D,\" then \"W,\" then select ing a character in a given word, and then hitting \"command accept\" (the CA key).</div><br><div>The corresponding steps are outlined below for the Control Metalanguage description of Figure 8, progressing from Statement 3, to Statement 3c, to Statement 3c2, to Subroutine +BUGSPEC, etc. </div><br><div>FIGURE 8 --- Metalanguage description of part of control language <br>3 (wc:) zap case </div><br><div>3A (b) [edit] dsp(backward tes*) . case  <br>.  <br>.  <br>.  <br>3B (c) [edit] dsp(copy ^es*) :s true => <am>adj1: . case </div><br><div>3Bl (c) s*=cc dsp(^copy character) e*=c,character +bug2spec  <br>+cdlim(b1,p1,p2,p3,p4) +cdlim(b2,p5,p6,p7,p8)  <br>+cpchtx(b1,p2,p4,pS,p6); </div><br><div>3B2 (w) s*=cw dsp(^copy word) e*=w,word +bug2spec  <br>+wdr2(b1,p1,p2,p3,p4) +wdr2(b2,p5,p6,p7,p8)  <br>+cpwdvs(b1,p2,p4,p5,p6); </div><br><div>3B3 (l) s*=cl dsp(^copy line) e*=l,line +bug2spec  <br>+ldlim(b1,p1,p2,p3,p4) +ldlim(b2,p5,p6,p7,p8) :c st b1<-sf(b1) p2,  <br>rif :p p2>p1 cr: then (cr) else (null) , p5 p6, p4 se(b1): goto  <br>[s] </div><br><div>3B4 (v) s*=cv dsp(^copy visible) e*=v,visible +bug2spec  <br>+vdr2(b1,p1,p2,p3,p4) +vdr2(b2,p5,p6,p7,p8)  <br>+cpwdvs(b1,p2,p4,p5,p6) ;  <br>.  <br>.  <br>.  <br>3b10 endcase +caqm ; </div><br><div>3C (d) [edit] dsp(delete ^es*) . case </div><br><div>3C1 (c) s*=dc dsp(^delete character) e*=c,character +bug1spec  <br>+cdlim(b1,p1,p2,p3,p4) +del; </div><br><div>3C2 (w) s*=dw dsp(^delete word) e*=w,word +bug1spec +wdr  <br>(b1,p1,p2,p3,p4) +del ;  <br>3C3 (l) s*=-dl dsp(^delete line) e*=l,line +bug1spec...  <br>.  <br>.  <br>. </div><br><div>The points or regions in Figure 7 corresponding to these statements and subroutines are marked by (3), (3C), (3C2), and (+ BUG1SPEC), to help compare the two representations</div><br><div>The same steps are indicated in Figure 8, starting from Statement 3:</div><br><div>\"D\" sets up the state described in Statement 3C</div><br><div>\"W\" sets up the state described in Statement 3C2</div><br><div>The subroutine +BUG1SPEC waits for the select-word (1) and CA (2) actions leading to the execution of the delete-word function.</div><br><div>Then the TWDR subroutine takes the bug-position parameter and sets pointers P1 through P4 to delimit the word in the text data.</div><br><div>Finally, the +DEL subroutine deletes what the pointers delimit, and then returns to the last-defined state (i.e., to where S* = DW) .</div><br><div>Basic Organization of the On-Line System (NLS)</div><br><div>Figure 9 shows the relationships among the major components of NLS. <br> <br>Figure 9-- Basic organization of NLS showing use of compilers and compiler-compiler to implement it</div><br><div>The Tree Meta Translator is a processor specially designed to produce new translators.</div><br><div>There is a special language the Tree Meta Language--for use in describing the translator to be produced.</div><br><div>A special Tree Meta library of subroutines must be used, along with the output of the Tree Meta Translator, to produce a functioning new translator. The same library serves for every translator it produces.</div><br><div>For programming the various subroutines used in our 940 systems, we have developed a special Machine-Oriented Language (MOL), together with an MOL Translator to convert MOL program descriptions into machine code (see Ref. Hay1 for a complete description) .</div><br><div>The MOL is designed to facilitate system programming, by providing a high level language for iterative, conditional, and arithmetic operations, etc., along with a block structure and conventions for labeling that fit our structured-statement on line manipulation aids.</div><br><div>These permit sophisticated computer aid where suitable, and also allow the programmer to switch to machine level coding (with full access to variables, labels, etc.) where core space, speed, timing, core-mapping arrangements, etc., are critical.</div><br><div>The NLS is organized as follows (letters refer to Figure 9):</div><br><div>The Control Processor (E) receives and processes successive user actions, and calls upon subroutines in the library (H) to provide it such services as the following:</div><br><div>Putting display feedback on the screen</div><br><div>Locating certain data in the file</div><br><div>Manipulating certain working data</div><br><div>Constructing a display view of specified data according to given view ing parameters, etc.</div><br><div>The NLS library subroutines (H) are produced from MOL programs (F), as translated by the MOL Translator (G).</div><br><div>The Control Processor is produced from the control-language description (D), written in Control Metalanguage, as translated by the CMLT (C).</div><br><div>The CMLT, in turn, is produced from a description (A) written in Tree Meta, as translated by the Tree Meta Translator (B)</div><br><div>Advantages of Metalanguage Approach to NLS Implementation</div><br><div>The metalanguage approach gives us improved-means for control-language specification, in terms of being unambiguous, concise, canonical, natural and easy to compose, study and modify.</div><br><div>Moreover, the Control Metalanguage specification promises to provide in itself a users' documentation that is completely accurate, and also has the above desirable characteristics to facilitate study and reference.</div><br><div>Modifying the control-dialogue procedures for existing functions, or making a reasonable range of changes or additions to these functions, can often be accomplished solely by additions or changes to the control-language record (in CML).</div><br><div>With our on-line studying, manipulating and compiling techniques, system additions or changes at this level can be thought out and implemented (and automatically documented) very quickly.</div><br><div>New functions that require basic operations not available through existing subroutines in the NLS library will need to have new subroutines specified and pro grammed (in MOL), and then will need new terms in CML to permit these new functions to be called upon. This latter requires a change in the record (A), and a new compilation of CMLT by means of the Tree Meta Translator.</div><br><div>On-line techniques for writing and modifying the MOL source code (F), for executing the compilations, and for debugging the routines, greatly reduce the effort involved in this process.</div><br><div><br>SERVICE-SYSTEM HARDWARE (OTHER THAN SDS 940)</div><br><div>In addition to the SDS 940, the facility in cludes peripheral equipment made by other manufacturers and equipment designed and constructed at SRI.</div><br><div>All of the non-SDS equipment is interfaced through the special devices channel which con nects to the second memory buss through the SDS memory interface connection (MIC).</div><br><div>This equipment, together with the RAD, is a significant load on the second memory buss. Not including the proposed \"special operations\" equipment, the maximum expected data rate is approximately 264,000 words per second or one out of every 2.1 memory cycles. However, with the 940 variable priority scheme for memory access (see Pirtle1), we expect less than 1 percent degradation in CPU efficiency due to this load.</div><br><div>This channel and the controllers (with the exception of the disc controller) were de signed and constructed at SRI.</div><br><div>In the design of the hardware serving the workstations, we have attempted to minimize the CPU burden by making the system as automatic as possible in its access to memory and by formatting the data in memory so as to minimize the executive time necessary to process it for the users.</div><br><div>Figure 10 is a block diagram of the special devices channel and associated equipment. The major components are as follows: </div><br><div>Figure 10--Special devices channel</div><br><div>Executive Control</div><br><div>This is essentially a sophisticated multiplexer that allows independent, asynchronous access to core from any of the 6 controllers connected to it. Its functions are the following:</div><br><div>Decoding instructions from the computer and passing them along as signals to the controllers.</div><br><div>Accepting addresses and requests for memory access (input or output) from the controllers, determining rela tive priority among the controllers, syn chronizing to the computer clock, and passing the requests along to memory via the MIC.</div><br><div>The executive control includes a comprehensive debugging panel that allows any of the 6 controllers to be operated off line without interfering with the operation of other controllers.</div><br><div>Disc File</div><br><div>This is a Model 4061 Bryant disc, selected for compatibility with the continued 940-system development by Berkeley's Project GENIE, where extensive file handling software was developed.</div><br><div>As formatted for our use, the disc will have a storage capacity of approximately 32 million words, with a data-transfer rate of roughly 40,000 words per second and average access time of 85 milliseconds.</div><br><div>The disc controller was designed by Bryant in close cooperation with SRI and Project GENIE.</div><br><div>Display System</div><br><div>The display systems consists of two identical subsystems, each with display controller, display generator, 6 CRT's, and 6 closed-circuit television systems.</div><br><div>The display controllers process display-command tables and display lists that are resident in core, and pass along display-buffer contents to the display genera tors.</div><br><div>The display generators and CRT's were developed by Tasker Industries to our specifications. Each has general character vector plotting capability They will accept display buffers consisting of instructions (beam motion, character writing, etc. ) from the controller. Each will drive six 5-inch high-resolution CRT's on which the display pictures are produced.</div><br><div>Character writing time is approxi mately 8 microseconds, allowing an average of 1000 characters on each of the six monitors when regenerating at 20 cps.</div><br><div>A high-resolution (875-line) closed circuit television system transmits display pictures from each CRT to a television monitor at the corresponding work-station console.</div><br><div>This system was developed as a \"best solution\" to our experimental-laboratory needs, but it turned out to have properties which seem valuable for more widespread</div><br><div>Since only all-black or all-white signal levels are being treated, the scan beam current on the cameras can be reduced to achieve a short-term image storage effect that yields flicker-free TV output even when the display refresh rate is as low as 15 cps. This allows a display generator to sustain about four times more displayed material than if the users were viewing direct-view refreshed tubes.</div><br><div>The total cost of small CRT, TV camera, amplifier-controller, and monitor came to about $ 5500 per workstation-- where a random-deflection, display-qual ity CRT of similar size would cost con siderably more and would be harder to drive remotely.</div><br><div>Another cost feature which is very important in some system environ ments favors this TV approach: The expensive part is centrally located; each outlying monitor costs only about $600, so terminals can be set up even where usage will be low, with some video switching in the central establishment to take one terminal down and put another up.</div><br><div>An interesting feature of the video system is that with the flick of a switch the video signal can be inverted, so that the image picked up as bright lines on dim background may be viewed as black lines on a light background. There is a definite user preference for this inverted form of display.</div><br><div>In addition to the advantages noted above, the television display also invites the use of such commercially available devices as extra cameras, scan converters, video switches, and video mixers to enrich system service.</div><br><div>For example, the video image of a user's computer-generated display could be mixed with the image from a camera focused on a collaborator at another terminal; the two users could communicate through both the computer and a voice intercom. Each user would then see the other's face superimposed on the display of data under discussion.</div><br><div>Superimposed views from cameras focused on film images or drawings, or on the computer hardware, might also be useful.</div><br><div>We have experimented with these techniques (see Figure 11) and found them to be very effective. They promise to add a great deal to the value of remote display terminals. <br>  </div><br><div>FIGURE 11--Television display obtained by mixing the video sognal from remote camera with that from the computer-generated display</div><br><div><br>Input-Device Controller</div><br><div>In addition to the television monitor, each work-station console has a keyboard, binary keyset, and mouse.</div><br><div>The controller reads the state of these devices at a preset interval (about 30 milli seconds) and writes it into a fixed location table in core.</div><br><div>Bits are added to information from the keyboards, keysets and mouse switches to indicate when a new character has been received or a switch has changed state since the last sample. If there is a new character or switch change, an interrupt is issued after the sample period.</div><br><div>The mouse coordinates are for matted as a beam-positioning instruction to the display generator. Provisions are made in the display controller for including an entry in the mouse-position table as a display buffer. This allows the mouse position to be continuously displayed without any attention from the CPU.</div><br><div>Special Operations</div><br><div>The box with this label in Figure 10 is at this time only a provision in the executive control for the addition of a high-speed device. We have tentative plans for add ing special hardware here to provide opera tions not available in the 940 instruction set, such as character-string moves and string-pattern matching.</div><br><div>Low-Priority Devices</div><br><div>This controller accommodates three devices with relatively low data-transfer rates. At this time only the line printer is implemented, with provisions for adding an on-line typewriter (Dura), a plotter, and a terminal for the proposed ARPA computer network.</div><br><div>The line printer is a Potter Model HSP-3502 chain printer with 96 printing characters and a speed of about 230 lines per minute.</div>",

Engelbart <br>Stanford Research Institute </div><br><div>Organisms and Organizations</div><br><div>I'll take an unlikely start and begin with dinosaurs. I have a six-year-old son who is tremendously impressed and intrigued with dinosaurs. We read and re-read all of the dinosaur books, and every time we go to the library we have to bring home new ones.</div><br><div>Consider a dinosaur (with what little we know and much we may speculate) as a big, monstrous organism whose specialized organs cooperated reasonably well by the then-prevailing standards of \"organism design\", but whose function was coordinated by a clumsy, crude nervous system and a pitiful little brain. My image of this \"clumsy nervous system\" can be characterized by the story I've heard (or perhaps this is one that I've invented for six-year-old consumption, and now believe) about an embattled dinosaur not sensing for several minutes that it was dead.</div><br><div>But yet apparently this was an organism marvelously fitted to its environment. The dinosaurs thrived for over 200 million years, as I remember from all those books, much longer than our race has been around. But suddenly -- suddenly in terms of geological time -- they disappeared.</div><br><div>My learned deduction, derived from first-grade scientific literature, is that competition from better-designed nervous system did them in: better sensors; better sensory-data analyzers (perception); better peripheral contingency decision making (reflexes); better coordination of the functioning of organs, muscles, etc; better rational analyses of events and history; better accumulation of learned experience; better projection, visualization and planning, etc., etc.</div><br><div>I want to fix in your minds an image of a biological organism that possessed formidable capability within the environment into which it evolved, but which couldn't make the grade against the competition that a continuing evolution brought into that environment.</div><br><div>Human organizations can be likened to biological organisms, and I find much value in considering the analogy. Organizations evolve too; their mutations are continually emerging and being tested for survival value within their environment. I happen to feel that evolution of their environment is beginning to threaten today's organizations, large and small -- finding them seriously deficient in their \"nervous-system\" design -- and that the degree of coordination, perception, rational adaptation, etc. which will appear in the next generation of human organizations will drive our present organizational forms, with their \"clumsy nervous systems\", into extinction.</div><br><div>It is these \"nervous-system\" functions, within human organizations, where I find the most significant intellectual complications stemming from the forthcoming multi-access computer networks.</div><br><div>Augmentation Systems</div><br><div>For many years I have been developing a research program at Stanford Research Institute aimed at Augmenting the Human Intellect. By intellect I mean the human competence to make, send, exchange and apply to decision-making the commodity called knowledge, as applied toward giving human individuals and organizations more effectiveness at formulating and pursuing their goals. My basic formulation of such a pursuit considers a large system of things to be involved in being intellectual, and being successful at it. A rough but useful categorization of the system's components is as follows:</div><br><div>Biologically Provided Human (BPH) capabilities are the basic components of this \"large system\" -- e.g., memory, visualization, learning and reasoning, as linked to the human's internal-external environment by sensory-perception and coordinate-motor I/O systems.</div><br><div>Culturally Provided (CP) items are also basic to this \"large system\": general things such as languages, methodologies, tools, and training; in specific forms such as algebra, schools, meetings, books, computers, maps and filing cabinets. Also, such items as the value structure, attitudes, motivations, etc. which are so important to the way an individual coordinates and directs his BPH capabilities, may similarly be said to be \"culturally provided\".</div><br><div>An Effective Individual (EI) has a particular system of these CP items built atop his BPH capabilities. Our EI is like a little colony grown around the \"raw-material\" human, where in number and diversity of items this \"ecology\" of interdependent dynamics is as subtle and rich as what we are coming generally to appreciate in the \"organic\" world around us.</div><br><div>An Effective Organization (EO) is composed of a group of EI components, plus another particular set of CP items associated with their working together.</div><br><div>These CP items are all candidates for redesign, toward more effective individuals and organizations. To provide a new \"augmentation system\" for an individual, or especially for a group, is a very complex challenge. Just suppose, for instance, that a really new system had been developed, and consider the problem of checking out a group of people on their \"new augmentation system\" -- it would involve such as: teaching them new concepts and skills for representing and manipulating information; changing their working and collaborative methods; having them learn new roles and acquire associated new attitudes; changing the format and style for their formulating and communicating, etc.</div><br><div>If the system is to represent a truly significant improvement, assume that the changes to which the new users must accommodate will pervade many levels and facets of the \"way of doing their daily work\", and that many of these changes will represent radical departures from their prior \"ways\". The people being given such a new system will have a rough period of learning and adaptation. People don't generally appreciate how many are the \"little ways of doing things\" that comprise our workaday world, that they may be subtly or radically changed, and that among them might appear a very different distribution of usage and importance. The EI and EO systems are more complex, but therefore richer, domains for development than is appreciated even (especially?) among the technologists in the computer and communication disciplines which have so much potential for changing those systems.</div><br><div>My main message about Augmentation Systems is that, while indeed there are very challenging technical problems involved in supporting tomorrow's Effective Individuals and Organizations, the larger Augmentation System is much more complex than the technological \"subsystem\" upon which it depends. We technologists aren't equipped to perceive this sort of thing, and those who are can't generally distinguish the Sunday-Supplement extrapolations from those more probable. It has been my business to struggle with these concepts for two decades now, and the signs that I read at least tell me that the changes in our ways of thinking and working will be more pervasive and extreme than ANY OF US appreciates -- a revolution like the development of writing and the printing press lumped together. The following notions represent some of the least fuzzy elements that I perceive.</div><br><div> The Intellectual Workshop</div><br><div>In the context of this Conference, it is useful to talk about providing an individual with a \"private intellectual work space\" -- sort of what his office is supposed to be for him now.</div><br><div>In using his office, an individual goes in, perhaps shuts his door, and spreads his current working information over his working surfaces. He keeps some local files there, does some thinking, some formulating and transmitting of messages to the outside, and receiving returning messages, etc. Some of these transmitted formulations are requisitions for things to be bought, made, commented upon, or etc. He sends them out and results will come back, usually in the form of information -- control feedback, substantive information from colleagues or support staff, etc. He digests, stores, reformulates, responds, and occasionally pursues reflective, creative thought.</div><br><div>The image I'm trying to develop is of an office being the \"intellectual workshop\" in which one does his collaborative bit within his working environment: one needs work spaces, tools to suit a myriad of tasks, places to store working materials, aids to hold them for examination and shaping -- and they all should be easy to reach, quick to adjust to the task, easy to keep track of, etc. Interactive computer aids will have very significant effects here.</div><br><div>This is the particular area that my group and I have been working on for some six years -- improving the individual's intellectual workshop -- as the first stage of exploring what augmentation might be like. By today's standards, we can demonstrate some impressive features in the workshop environment which we have created to test by our daily use (for doing our daily work). But by our own perspective, as developed through constant struggle in this domain, we have but a primitive outpost on an unbelievably rich frontier. References 1 through 4 describe our work. I invite you to become acquainted, e.g. with Reference <Ref-1>. Copies of the movie (Reference 2 are available; viewing this provides the best introduction to our \"augmented office\".</div><br><div>It will take the explorers of this domain decades to even map its currently visible dimensions. The real rush hasn't begun: this Conference is a meeting of suppliers looking at the prospector trade; we haven't really been giving attention to the developments that will follow the prospecting.</div><br><div>My research group is now moving into a next stage of work that we call \"team augmentation\". Here, instead of just the individual facilitating his private domain of searching, studying, thinking and formulating, as his office place provides for him, we are exploring what can be done for a team of \"augmented individuals\" who have in common a number of terminals, a set of computer tools, working files, etc. (as we do) to facilitate their team collaborations.</div><br><div>Our major initial step toward augmenting a team is to facilitate the collaborative dialogue between its members, aiming for new kinds and degrees of collaboration that can thus be achieved.</div><br><div>Collaborative Dialogue</div><br><div>To discuss our \"Dialogue Support System\", consider a shared-file space. This is a common enough thing in today's time-shared environment; but our dialogue-file space comprises \"frozen\" contributions from the collaborators -- i.e., it represents the \"Journal\" of transactional entries that make up the collaborative dialogue, entries that are part of the history of things and aren't to be changed.</div><br><div>Assume that you are a participant in this dialogue, as from a CRT terminal in your office. You have just contributed some sort of entry into this Journal -- some tentative formulation of a plan or design. You expect some of your collaborators to be interested. You may have installed an \"attention\" signal at entry time, aimed at a particular set of people. At their consoles, they either receive an \"annunciator\" signal to alert them, or may have come across you entry via any number of natural pathways in the course of their work.</div><br><div>These other people can very quickly and flexibly survey your contribution. At any subsequent time, in any passage of your contribution, one of them can attach a \"comment\" to any specific entity (e.g., word, string of words, paragraph, drawing line or label in the drawing). A comment can be one word (e.g., \"Congratulations!\"), or a reference to a contradictory passage, or a long exhortation about a better way to do the whole thing, other people will be attaching comments at other places, including comments upon other people's comments. What soon evolves from such activity is a network of contributions that represents a full-scale discourse, distributed over time and, if you wish, over space.</div><br><div>A good \"office-support system\" will provide powerful aids to improve the effectiveness with which one can participate in such a dialogue. For example, one needs speed and flexibility in studying the consequent network of dialogue contributions and in filtering out that which is relevant -- for instance to make a successive version of a plan or design. We are evolving aids for searching through specified sub-nets and selecting upon such attributes as content, previously assigned descriptive tags, authorship, absolute or relative \"publishing\" time, and citation linkages; assembling passages from the dialogue, and from one's own notes, with flexible disposition of one's screen into \"windows\" for independently viewing different materials; easily affixing new links and tags to arbitrary segments of a given memo; conveniently copying into one's own working file a categorized compilation of extracts. etc.</div><br><div>One recognizes, of course, that the existing system of professional journals represents a similar mode of dialogue, distributed as it were over space and time. But the computer-aided dialogue has certain advantages to offer: interchanges in cycle times of minutes or seconds instead of years or months; accommodating more items, and items of much smaller size, without overloading the \"clerical system\"; accommodating more people making simultaneous accesses and contributions; providing citation followup to exact items (i.e., the computer can take you almost instantly to look at the particular item cited within another \"document\").</div><br><div>Within a team that has the kinds of tools and methods that are easily foreseeable, these features are really quite interesting and exciting to consider. We are planning to experiment with this type of collaboration in support of our own system-development activity, within our own shop.</div><br><div>Office-Sharing and Dialogue in the ARPA Network</div><br><div>Our Augmentation Research Center, at SRI, is a participating site in ARPA'S experimental computer network (see References 5 and 6). My group is hoping that here the \"augmented office\" approach can be applied to a fuller advantage -- i,e., we hope to see researchers at other sites beginning to use the Office for their work, work other than \"studying and improving the Office\" (which is what my group does). Using our Office system from his home-site CRT terminal, a researcher in computer languages for instance could do the composing, modifying and studying associated with developing his research tools, with setting up and running tests, with integrating the results into his notes, and with communicating and publishing the results.</div><br><div>His experimental programs and compilations may be run on the computer at his home site, or at other Network sites -- there will be means within the Office making it easy to interface to any special tools and data through the Network. The office is the place where special attention is given to facilitating such supportive intellectual processes as formulating specifications for service requested and for how to present the results and where in the office's records to insert them; there are general needs in this regard over many activities, and the access to all of the special tools being developed in other computer-research areas will be very much heightened if they can be used from an \"office\" where a unified approach was taken to harnessing these tools. Examples: send you analytic formulation to MIT'S Math Lab for processing; Utah's graphic-manipulation processes could construct your illustrations; and the ILLIAC IV can do your heavy computations.</div><br><div>In this network, my group is slated to serve as the Network Information Center, which role offers new ways to experiment with collaborative dialogue. As we ourselves learn how to deal with it within our \"conjoint office space\", we expect to begin offering use of our \"Dialogue Support System\", through the Network, to people scattered over the country who want to do collaborative things in pursuit of Network activities. For instance, two graduate students from different universities could work closely together on a project, or a professor at one site could serve as a thesis advisor for a graduate student at another site.</div><br><div>The Knowledge Market</div><br><div>Here is a brief extrapolation into the future and its Augmented Individuals and Organizations, looking beyond both the ARPA Network and my little experiments with an Augmented Office and a Dialogue Support System. Obviously there will be steadily widening distribution of common-resource accessibility, and a steadily increasing number of people who spend a significant amount of their professional time at terminals. The greater amount and diversity of mutually accessible resources -- human, financial, technological -- will accelerate growth along a number of dimensions. In particular, there will emerge a new \"marketplace\", representing fantastic wealth in commodities of knowledge, service, information, processing, storage, etc. In the number and rage of transactions, and in the speed and flexibility with which they are negotiated, this new market will have a vitality and dynamism as much greater than today's as today's is greater than the village market.</div><br><div>It seems apparent to me that, following this increased mutual accessibility between knowledge resources and consumers, will be the development of more \"depth\" in the range of both. E.g., just as with the roles of specialty shops and services in some of our industries today, there will be a large number of individuals and small groups each providing highly specialized services. Since their clientele will be drawn from such a large market, they will find a good business even where they serve only a small portion of the market and provide only seldom-needed special services.</div><br><div>Let's look at a specific \"for instance\". Suppose that one person becomes extremely proficient in making small programs to generate a display or printout to show (particularly well) the status of a multi-task project. He is an independent agent in this multi-access computer network, working at a CRT console in his office at home. Perhaps he specializes in construction projects, and within this perhaps in steelwork erection. You are a management consultant working (from your home) on a short job helping to set up the production-control system for a construction project. When you realized that you might benefit from this kind of help, this is the sequence that takes place:</div><br><div>Your man is easy enough to find because of computer help in searching for an evaluating special products and services. Suppose that you need something he can do for you with about 45 minutes's effort. You expect immediate accessibility for negotiation -- for instance: it takes you one minute to locate several candidates, two minutes to examine their relative credentials, 20 seconds interrogation of public records to select him as being available right now for your kind of problem, two minutes of personal dialogue to determine for both of you that his capabilities and your needs match, and 15 seconds to negotiate and legalize a contract. He does his job in 40 minutes, and spends five more minutes transferring the results to you (with dialogue).</div><br><div>He switches back immediately to a task sequence whose contract arrangement had permitted him such interruptions. In working on this job, you have been \"time-shared\" with several other jobs having higher priority, and several that were running \"background\". During the forty minutes he was off doing his thing for you, your higher-priority task sequences took you off on other pursuits. In fact, when he was done, you weren't ready to get back to him for twenty-three minutes, but the mutual-scheduling algorithm agreed upon in your contract took care of connecting you and him, when you were both ready, for your final dialogue.</div><br><div>Your dialogue, of course, comprised both voice and shared computer graphics. Your mutually viewed display could be flipped back and forth between views of what he called forth on his end to show you, and what you provided to show him. As you were showing him your work domain, he was \"catching\" reference links into the specific items that he might later need to get at, entering quick notes on some of them.</div><br><div>The whole dialogue was recorded, as a matter of course and for either of you to use later. The stored speech was digitized, and automatically segmented into the alternate passages of your exchange. During your dialogue, whenever one of you referred to a displayed item in your speech, your practice was to make an explicit screen-select action in association with the spoken reference term (e.g., with a \"that line\" or \"both of these figures\" expression), so that when any given passage might later be selected for \"playback\", the computer could re-create for you the image you were seeing and indicate the displayed entity being referenced.</div><br><div>Some of the dialogue had stimulating and instructive contents for you, You wanted to save these and integrate them into your personal notes. Citations to this dialogue are easy to install in your notes, including citations to a speech passage -- where, upon later seeing such a citation and \"calling for\" the item it refers to, the associated bit string would be found and the speech passage played back for you.</div><br><div>Perhaps you consider some of the speech passages to be useful enough to have them transcribed into text. A quick designation of your desire causes these speech strings to be transmitted to a service you customarily use for doing you transcription. This service harnesses the latest speech-recognition computer aids, implemented with special-purpose hardware and software, and includes skilled clerical staff who supplement the 98% capability of the machine. Your two-minute transcription job is scheduled through their served units quite automatically, and the text strings are routed back and inserted in their appropriate places without your further attention. You have established the convention with the service agency that un-decipherable or dubious passages will be tagged, and if you had wanted to you could have designated when you sent the job off that you wanted to be interrupted to resolve such when the material returned.</div><br><div>When you and your contractor parted ways, you each might exercise an optional procedure which helps you record your impressions of the other. An important part of your value within this marketplace rests upon your ability to integrate effectively the skills and knowledge of others. So you pay careful attention both to your \"intelligence\" base which helps you keep track of appropriate people, and to conducting your negotiations and working relationships with an eye for doing well by the other guy -- because he too probably keeps an effective intelligence system and it might well be important to you later that he (or his friends) feels good about working with you. You also need to assess his potential value to you for other and different collaboration.</div><br><div>It is recognized rather widely that computer networks raise significant problems about the privacy of closed information. The other side of the coin is that computer networks raise rather remarkable opportunities to benefit from the sharing of open information. I am quite convinced that there is very high value to be derived within the Computer-Network Knowledge Market from a degree of openness with what have heretofore been considered as private types of information.</div><br><div>Among the members of a working team, this could mean keeping open as a matter of course all of their scratch notes, trial designs, etc. to their colleagues, and expecting them to browse, comment, etc. Once this is the standard operating mode, those aspects of a person's vulnerability that depend mainly upon another's lack of understanding and compassion begin to find a compensating safeguard in the fact that hurtful actions taken therefrom by another person tend also to have complete visibility. This visibility, plus long-lasting availability of notes and records, would be important to the processes by which each person evaluates his potential colleagues -- which soon becomes important to those concerned with personal growth within this market, and moves toward a lower significance otherwise hurtful actions attempted by those without mature concern for their own growth, or without ability to grow into or stay in a position where their comments and actions are trusted or seriously considered.</div><br><div>This may seem unduly naive, I know. But then consider an Afghanistanian villager, whose entire worldly experience is with a primitive every-man-for-himself market: what might it sound like to him to hear a peer suggest that the marketplace would benefit hugely by operating upon the basis of trusting the other man's word. \"I say that I will pay you next week for a dozen buns, and I walk away without counting how many buns you put into the bag.\" Unreal fantasy -- talk of credit accounts, checking accounts, credit ratings, credit cards, etc. What does this have to do with getting the best price for my goat, to deal with abstractions such as accounts, promises to honor, reputation, etc. in a formalized, recorded fashion? Ludicrous restrictions and dangerous vulnerability for a system to expect both me and my neighbor (adversary) to reveal our positions, stand behind the things we say and the marks we make, and depend upon the other to do so.</div><br><div>It seems clear that today's Western-world economy couldn't be as strong as it is if such open vulnerability didn't prevail. I only wish that I knew the evolutionary dynamics that produced the attitudes and customs necessary to make the \"honest openness\" work -- obviously its practice in the Afghanistanian village would lead to disaster, and yet it likely was from just such a market environment that ours evolved.</div><br><div>It seems not unreasonable to assume that survival value in our cultural evolution will favor institutions which support the most efficient Knowledge Markets (organisms which support the most efficient nervous systems). Then certainly the Knowledge Market will someday operate with more open trust in its knowledge interchange, to release for constructive ends a great deal of otherwise entrapped human energy. Those who grow up within such an environment will look back with pity upon the primitive fears and protective practices prevailing in 1970.</div><br><div>Summary</div><br><div>I think that tomorrow's institutions can be (must be) far better adapted to their environment, much better at providing for a full life style for everyone. These changes require a very significant increase in the institutions' ability to develop, support, and integrate the intellectual power of their individuals and organizations. And, as I see it, this ability will be directly dependent upon advanced application of interactive computers and multi-access computer networks. But the following condition is very strong in this \"implications\" picture: to harness this technology toward these ends will require intense concurrent development of our very complex and sophisticated system of concepts, conventions, methods, skills, organizational forms, attitudes, and values. It is time, and the means are at hand, to develop a much improved nervous system for our \"social organisms\".</div>",

Engelbart<br>Stanford Research Institute</div><br><div>Introduction</div><br><div>Generally, adoption of a multi-access computer network is promoted on the basis of increased accessibility and economy of computational and data-bank resources for a distributed community of users. But visualize this resource-sharing computer network as a general-purpose digital-packet transportation system linking resources, processors, vendors, brokers, customers, etc.; then consider that the existence of such a transportation system will inevitably stimulate growth of an information market involving many processes, products, and services. A distributed community availing itself of such a transportation system should rightfully count on such market development for much of its payoff from its early investment.</div><br><div>In particular, the \"Knowledge Workshop\" services described below will grow to become very important to network-coupled communities that are involved with a common discipline or mission -- my judgement is that this use of computer networks will come to dominate over the purely computational use in scale and generally perceived social worth, with today's type of computer services being seen as but a special subset of the tools integrated into a coherent knowledge workshop.</div><br><div>The Knowledge Workshop</div><br><div>In using the term \"knowledge workshop\", I build directly upon terms \"knowledge work\" and \"knowledge worker\", whose special use I first came across in reading Peter Drucker (Ref-1). He develops a much larger theme about these concepts in Ref-2, adding terms such as \"knowledge technologies\", \"knowledge economy\", and \"knowledge society\", and pointing out that the growing level and importance of knowledge-work activity in our society will produce a discontinuity in our cultural evolution of a scale commensurate with that of the industrial revolution.</div><br><div>The knowledge workshop is the specially provided environment in which knowledge workers do their knowledge work. We can talk about a small knowledge workshop for an individual, or a large knowledge workshop for an organization. Knowledge workshops have existed for centuries, but here we consider maximizing their effectiveness by systematically evolving tools, methods, etc., with heavy dependence upon the new technologies of computer time sharing and networking. (In the text below, read \"knowledge workshop\" for \"Workshop\".)</div><br><div>Basic workshop functions must serve the daily handling of the users' working information -- of their notes, things-to-do lists, memos, letters, designs, plans, budgets, announcements, commentary, proposals, reports, programs, documentation, item-control catalogs, etc. And before it can sensibly be of much value, we believe that a Workshop has to provide for the grubby cut-and-try detail involved in the minute-by-minute, day-after-day worker's handling of this information: in its composition, studying, commenting upon, arguing about, modifying, communicating, publishing, presenting, etc. There are many exciting, elegant tools in the offing -- superlative graphics, artificial-intelligence services, etc. -- but their serious application will only be sensible within an integrated Workshop, and in a manner whose associated conceptual and procedural skills are consistent with those of tools and techniques that support the basic Workshop functions.</div><br><div>For the past ten years in the Augmentation Research Center (ARC), at Stanford Research Institute, we have concentrated in succession on exploring the computer augmentation of knowledge workshops, first for an individual, then as extended for a project team, and then for a network-coupled, distributed community (See Ref-3). Over the past three years we have developed a beginning set of prototype \"community-Workshop\" services on the ARPANET, as associated with our serving as the Network Information Center (NIC).*</div><br><div>[Footnote] *The following agencies have contributed components of direct support to this ten-year development: The Information Processing Techniques Office (ARPA), Langley Research Center (NASA), Rome Air Development Center (USAF), and the Information Systems Branch (ONR).</div><br><div>Our focus all along has been toward supporting R&D workers, and we have followed the empirical, bootstrapping approach of doing as much of our own work as possible in our Workshop, continuously building, using, and evolving it. Our Workshop services are supplied by a large software system that we call NLS, running under TENEX on a PDP-10. It provides a large repertoire of functions to display terminals (DNLS), online typewriter terminals (TNLS), or via deferred-execution of commands and text from offline typewriters as accumulated on cassettes or other intermediate storage (DEX). Hardcopy output is available on typewriters, online printers, or through an offline phototypesetting device providing publication-grade quality for multi-font text, computer-directed graphic constructs, or scan-stored diagrams.</div><br><div>Besides giving constant, pragmatic attention to the needs and possibilities for evolution of support functions and working methods, we have had to struggle with what is a soul-wrenching burden for people whose orientation is toward exploratory development -- trying to meet the absolutely necessary requirements of organizing, documenting, maintaining, and operating the hardware/software and clerical services towards being responsive and reliable, minute after minute and day after day.</div><br><div>Technology has reached a state warranting much more activity explicitly applied toward the evolution both of better Workshops, and of a coherent discipline associated with Workshop-system development; for this to happen, it is obvious that more people must take on the challenge of becoming \"Workshop architects\", and that more pilot-plant Workshops need to be set up for exploratory support of real knowledge-work activities. There are (will be many) approaches to be tried besides ours, of course; but to do our bit toward accellerating this process, we intend to share and extend our developments and knowledge by making our Workshop tools available for exploratory application in distributed, modular, pilot-Workshop sites, and by offering close collaboration with the pilot-Workshop architects. (Note below that an important Workshop feature being offered is designed to facilitate such \"distributed collaboration\".)</div><br><div>Prototype Community-Workshop Support</div><br><div>We aren't ignoring exploratory use within localized organizations, but we are committing a substantial portion of our energy toward the early, exploratory use of knowledge-workshop services to support distributed, network-coupled communities. There are two special reasons for this commitment:</div><br><div>The first reason concerns relative payoff: if a service facilitates hobnobbing via terminals, there is extra value when this supplants air fare and a two-day trip in contrast with supplanting a walk down the hall; there is more payoff from relatively costly augmentation services when they facilitate collaboration among participants who are distributed rather than among those who are already clustered.</div><br><div>The second reason concerns a wider awareness of the possibilities for augmenting knowledge workshops, and a wider interest and involvement in their accelerated evolution -- things we hope to enhance by facilitating community-Workshop exploration. We find that toward significant Workshop innovations a user needs a sort of warming-up process before gracefully giving something new a try. Thereafter, in the right environment, he will \"naturally\" adopt successive stages of significant new Workshop techniques. This process is noticeably facilitated by steady exposure to the products and conventions of Workshop services; and it helps considerably to have a variety of opportunities and materials to stimulate and support the \"giving it a try\" -- for instance, to try a little online dialogue with a distant, more-advanced colleague, dealing with materials already in the community data base. Also, if a new stage of service is available in this \"community way\", a large number of people will benefit from the lower threshold of investment and determination needed to give it a try.</div><br><div>Following is a brief description of community-Workshop applications that special communities can consider exploring. The sequence represents an explicit progression, beginning with tested techniques whose \"cultural shock\" and financial investment are relatively low, and offering paced, open-ended evolution with time, experience, and perceived payoff. We are arranging for computer support of these services by a commercial-quality \"utility\" service connected to the ARPANET. We will provide this Workshop support (at cost) over the Network to selected subscribers for setting up and exploring prototype, augmented-Workshop applications. We expect the Workshop toolkit to be continually expanding and improving, and plan for much of the evolutionary energy and direction to come from the subscribers.</div><br><div>Collaborative Dialogue: We offer computer aids for the composition of messages and for their subsequent reviewing, cross-referencing, modification, transmission, storage, indexing, and full-text retrieving. A \"message\" may be one word in length, or a hundred printed pages. In any message there may be formalized citations pointing to specific passages in prior messages, so that a group of related messages becomes a network of recorded-dialogue contributions. There is also: automatic delivery of messages; full cataloging and indexing; online accessibility both to message notification and to the full text of all messages; and open-ended storage of the dialogue records. These services enable a community of people who are distributed in space and time to maintain recorded, collaborative dialogue at a new degree of effectiveness.</div><br><div>Then to support \"real-time\" remote dialogue (teleconferencing), we have the following facility: Any two DNLS users can \"link up\" at any time, so that each party sees a common display view, including both his and the other person's cursor; either party is able to point or control, and they mutually have access to the full range of Workshop functions, over any of the online information. The responsiveness and bandwidth of the ARPANET provide remarkably good support of our highly interactive DNLS service to remote display users, so that when used to supplement a telephone conversation, the speed and flexibility of this shared, \"augmented blackboard\" brings a new quality to teleconferencing that is really quite dramatic.</div><br><div>Document Development, Production, And Control: We offer a rich set of computer aids for the composition, study, and modification of document drafts, and for automatically generating high-quality photocomposition output with flexible controls for font-designation and formatting, to enable the production of publication-grade hardcopy (printing masters, or microform masters). There are processes for collaboration between several writers, and with an editor, in the process of evolving a final draft. Included among such helpers can be experienced production people to help in laying out a finished document, in inserting proper designations for specifying font, size, and density of different character strings, and for managing footnotes, cross-references, tables of contents, indices, etc. There are also aids for the people who must keep control of changes, new-version distributions, etc., and provide the indexing to complex documents or sets of documents. Planned improvements include facility for handling complex graphic portrayals and extensive special symbols.</div><br><div>Research Intelligence: The provisions within the Dialogue Support System for cataloguing and indexing internally generated items also support the management of externally generated items -- bibliography, contact reports, clippings, notes, etc. With these centrally supplied (therefore uniformly available) services, a community can maintain a dynamic and highly useful \"intelligence\" data base to help it keep up to date on external happenings that particularly affect it. Microform distribution can provide for mass replication of this data base at remote sites, and computer-generated indexes or online retrieval can facilitate access. Citations of external items from within the internally-generated dialogue base -- in the form of annotations, miscellaneous commentary, or supportive references -- offer computer-sensible interlinking of the external information with the internal, and considerably facilitate browsing, retrieval, back-citation searching, etc.</div><br><div>The Community could choose to operate a special Information Analysis and Integration Center as a nucleus to this activity, but the notes and private-collection records of individual users, integrated into the \"recorded dialogue\", could well add the more value. (Ref-4 describes some developments and possibilities for support of research intelligence.)</div><br><div>Community Handbook Development: We are extending the above services toward the coordinated handling of a very large and complex body of documentation and its associated external references. I use the term \"superdocument\" to refer to such material when integrated into a monolithic whole. There are a number of important applications for a system that facilitates the responsive development and evolution of a superdocument by many (distributed) individuals. In particular, for either a discipline- or project-oriented community, one very important application of a centrally available \"superdocumentation\" service would be to maintain \"The Community Handbook\" -- i.e., a uniform, complete, consistent, up-to-date integration of the special knowledge representing the current status of the Community.</div><br><div>The Handbook would include: principles, working hypotheses, practices, special-term glossaries, standards, goals, goal status, supportive arguments, techniques, observations, how-to-do-it items, etc. An active community would be constantly involved in dialogue bearing upon the contents of the last formal version of its Handbook -- comments, errata, suggestions, challenges, counter examples, altered designs, improved arguments, new experimental techniqes and data, etc. Constant updating would provide a \"certified, community position structure\" about which the real evolutionary work would swarm; flexible aids for online \"navigation and view generation\" would be very important, as would the facility for automatic publication (especially into microform editions).</div><br><div>Computer-Based Instruction: If relatively widespread applicability of Computer-Based Instruction (CBI) were suitable for the Community, then there would likely be advantage gained from pooling resources and utilizing a community-coordinated instructional service. For a community also utilizing other centrally managed Workshop services of the scope and power described here, there would be considerable overlap between them and their CBI processes and activities.</div><br><div>Even though CBI has more visibility and momentum as a discipline than does CBKW (Computer-Based Knowledge Workshop), it seems inevitable that the former will end up as being but a special, integrated component of the latter. One should expect CBI service anyway in his Workshop, and he won't expect to go to a different terminal or to learn a different set of interactive concepts and skills to get that service; and also, that service will often bear directly upon concepts and matters deeply embedded in the workaday domain of his Workshop system.</div><br><div>It is also very probable (to my mind) that communities will ultimately integrate their Handbook and CBI techniques so that their monolithic, superdocument Handbook would contain the special tags, links and etc. required by the CBI computer processes so that a significant portion of the instructional services would be generated directly from the primary knowledge source, the Community Handbook.</div><br><div>Meetings and Conferences: This refers to assemblies of people, which occurrences aren't likely for a long time yet to be supplanted in total effect by technological aids. In supporting our own ARC meetings, demonstrations, etc., we use TV-projector equipment that projects our regular work-terminal display images onto a movie screen, easily readable in a meeting room having enough ambient light for comfortably reading notes and seeing each other. Images from live TV-cameras or from video recorders can also be projected. We make use of commercial devices for controlling these various video signals -- switching, mixing, and frame-splitting. We can mix two signals to get image superposition, or split the video frame to get a computer-display picture on one part of the screen and a camera image on the other (for example, simultaneously showing the camera view of the user's controlling actions right along with the display responses from the computer).</div><br><div>With this projector setup, we use our regular Workshop techniques in meetings to present and explain material from the online data base. It is easy to review and change the agenda and the meeting notes; some meetings operate very profitably in a mode of \"collaborative position-statement development\", with a facility that for many purposes is far superior to using a blackboard -- it is as though the blackboard now is very easily stretched to make room for new notes, edited, scrolled, folded, reorganized, or etc., and any available online material may be copied onto it for integration into the study, re-organization, re-wording, development process. A skilled Workshop user can operate this \"blackboard\" with enough speed and flexibility that these processes often don't seem to be what limits group progress (in the midst of questions, deliberations, etc.).</div><br><div>Any Workshop user at the gathering can call on part of his own online notes, or use his familiarity with certain material, to bring special information before the assembly. Or, the whole assembly can see the display being controlled by another individual (or assembly) at a remote site, in shared-display dialogue. There are many further technical and procedural innovations to explore in improving the effectiveness of meetings -- e.g. computer-processed bio-feedback, radical changes in the \"rules of order\", and giving each participant independent use of a private display terminal.</div><br><div>Community Management and Organization: Where the Community has conventional, project-management operations, their Workshop can include computer aids for such as PERT and CPM, plus the enriching services of dialogue support, document development, and a \"Handbook\" system. An extension of the Handbook could contain plans, commitments, schedules, specifications, current-state records of work in progress, etc., with special Workshop tools to support management analysis and control.</div><br><div>But also, with the probable increase in the amount and intensity of distributed collaboration within the Community, \"committee work\" would become more widespread, dynamic, and important. Thus there would be greater dependence upon better techniques for inter-communication and management within the committee-like structures by which a Community goes about its composite business. Harnessing these new techniques will lead to very different ways in which distributed communities can be organized and in which they can go about their business -- and the possibility of considerable improvement here, stemming from relatively modest innovative investments, is an important part of our motivation toward facilitating Community Workshop exploration.</div><br><div>Special Knowledge Work by Individuals and Teams: Assumedly, Community members could avail themselves of the above types of Workshop service in support of their own daily work -- i.e., for other than their participating in community-oriented activities. There are obvious benefits to almost any knowledge worker from use of general Workshop facilities such as listed above; and for a team (or any close-working organizational unit) of augmented knowledge workers, there is yet another level of benefit to be gained by adopting new organizational structure and collaborative methods that harness better the new capabilities existing within the Workshop (as extended by a few special team-support tools).</div><br><div>Then further, the particular set of disciplines and pursuits which characterize the Community will generally have special computer-based processes and data that are important in its work -- i.e. unique functions and forms in its analytical programs, statistical processes, numerical data, conceptual/analytic models, graphic portrayals of subject matter, etc. Assuming that they are available within the same computer network that distributes the Community's Workshop-support services, then access to these special computer-based resources can be provided to a worker \"through\" the coordinated Workshop in which he does his other work -- and to a distinct advantage.</div><br><div>In any of this special work, there is basic advantage in having a flexible, powerful facility for managing mixed text and graphics -- composing, studying, modifying, integrating new material into working notes and reports, publishing, doing collaborative dialogue, giving presentations, etc. When doing tasks of this sort in assocation with his special computer-based operations, it is an important advantage to the worker to do so within a familiar and consistent working environment. Our Workshop flexibly provides for special translation of information passing back and forth to any such \"external\" computer service, so that for access to a wide variety of such services the Workshop can provide users with consistent conventions and methods in whose use his other Workshop tools would be of maximum support.</div><br><div>Conclusion</div><br><div>The full sense of what computer networks offer in the way of \"resource sharing\" contains some special twists of significance here: For one thing, a truly complete Workshop will contain a very large repertoire of service functions, and the evolution, operation, and maintenance of these functions (and their support software) will require highly trained specialists. Any sort of widespread exploration of augmented-Workshop techniques will be very much facilitated by the network's capability for sharing the expertise of such specialists -- by enabling central computational resources that they develop and maintain to service distributed users. Note that specialists working from their home Workshop will be able to reach through the network to install and maintain software in remote hardware installations, which will be important, too; but note also that many already-present local computers and operating systems are inappropriate for supporting all of the important Workshop functions.</div><br><div>For another thing, the vocabulary and procedural skill required to harness these functions effectively and smoothly into one's worklife will become very extensive and sophisticated (the pidgin-English approach won't provide the power, and full-statement natural language isn't fast enough), and again special expertise will be necessary to help people through the learning stages as their Workshop matures. Therefore, although the network can very much facilitate bringing into user reach these powerful Workshop tools, it requires the additional network-supported (Workshop) facilities such as teleconferencing to enable a limited number of Workshop specialists to give close support to these learning processes, without which the computer services would have much less value.</div><br><div>If exploration of Workshop use were to occur only where there exists both an appropriate local computer system and trained specialists to maintain the software and train the users, there would be a very much slower evolution toward the increased-effectiveness possibilities offered by computer augmentation.</div><br><div>Finally, the \"digital-packet transportation system\" aspect of a computer network seems quite essential to the practical, effective support of an augmented Community Knowledge Workshop -- which in turn seems to offer a really important and unique means for sharing among a community of humans the distributed nuclei of human resources represented by individuals with special knowledge, judgement, intuition, imagination, conceptual skills, etc. This human-resource sharing has explosive potential -- I look to it with a biological metaphor as providing a new evolutionary stage for the nervous system of social organisms, from which much more highly developed institutional forms may evolve that are much improved in: awareness of self and environment, situational cognizance and response, visualization of the future, problem-solving capability, etc. (See Ref-5 for expansion of this theme.)</div>",

ENGELBART <br>14-MAR-73 17:15 (AUGMENT,13851,)</div><br><div><br>INTRODUCTION</div><br><div>The theme of this paper ties directly to that developed in a concurrent paper \"The Augmented Knowledge Workshop,\" [1], and assumes that: \"intelligent terminals\" will come to be used very, very extensively by knowledge workers of all kinds; terminals will be their constant working companions; service transactions through their terminals will cover a surprisingly pervasive range of work activity, including communication with people who are widely distributed geographically; the many \"computer-aid tools\" and human services thus accessible will represent a thoroughly coordinated \"knowledge workshop\"; most of these users will absorb a great deal of special training aimed at effectively harnessing their respective workshop systems -- in special working methods, conventions, concepts, and procedural and operating skills.</div><br><div>Within the Augmentation Research Center (ARC), we have ten years of concentrated experience in developing and using terminal systems whose evolution has been explicitly oriented toward such a future environment; from this background, two special topics are developed in this paper:</div><br><div>What we (at ARC) have learned about controlling interactive-display services, and the means we have evolved for doing it -- the particular devices (mouse, keyset, keyboard), feedback, and protocol/skill features; and design data, usage techniques, learnability experience, and relevant needs and possibilities for alternatives and extensions.</div><br><div>Our considerations and attitudes regarding the distribution of functions between terminal and remote/shared resources -- including assumptions about future-terminal service needs, our networking experience, and foreseen trends in the associated technologies.</div><br><div>The references [2-19] include considerable explicit description of developments, principles, and usage (text, photos, and movies) to support the following discussion. Annotation is included, not only to provide a guide for selective follow up, but also to supplement the substance to the body of the paper by the nature of the commentary.</div><br><div><br>CONTROL MEANS </div><br><div>Introduction</div><br><div>Our particular system of devices, conventions, and command-protocol evolved with particular requirements: we assumed, for instance, that we were aiming for a workshop in which these very basic operations of designating and executing commands would be used constantly, over and over and over again, during hour-after-hour involvement, within a shifting succession of operations supporting a wide range of tasks, and with eventual command vocabularies that would become very large.</div><br><div>The Mouse for Display Selection</div><br><div>During 1964-65 we experimented with various approaches to the screen selection problem for interactive display work within the foregoing framework. The tests [6,7] involved a number of devices, including the best light pen we could buy, a joy stick, and even a knee control that we lashed together. To complete the range of devices, we implemented an older idea, what became known as our \"mouse,\" that came through the experiments ahead of all of its competitors and has been our standard device for eight years now.</div><br><div>The tests were computerized, and measured speed and accuracy of selection under several conditions. We included measurement of the \"transfer time\" involved when a user transferred his mode of action from screen selection with one hand to keyboard typing with both hands; surprisingly, this proved to be one of the more important aspects in choosing one device over another.</div><br><div>The nature of the working environment diminished the relative attractiveness of a light pen, for instance, because of fatigue factors and the frustrating difficulty in constantly picking up and putting down the pen as the user intermixed display selections with other operations.</div><br><div>The mouse is a screen-selection device that we developed in 1964 to fill a gap in the range of devices that we were testing. It is of palm-filling size, has a flexible cord attached, and is operated by moving it over a suitable hard surface that has no other function than to generate the proper mixture of rolling and sliding motions for each of the two orthogonally oriented disk wheels that comprise two of the three support points.</div><br><div>Potentiometers coupled to the wheels produce signals that the computer uses directly for X-Y positioning of the display cursor. It is an odd-seeming phemomenon, but each wheel tends to do the proper mix of rolling and sideways sliding so that, as the mouse is moved, the wheel's net rotation closely matches the component of mouse movement in the wheel's \"rolling\" direction; one wheel controls up-down and the other left-right cursor motion.</div><br><div>Exactly the same phenomenon, applied in the mechanical integrators of old-fashioned differential analyzers, was developed to a high degree of accuracy in resolving the translation components; we borrowed the idea, but we don't try to match the precision. Imperfect mapping of the mouse-movement trajectory by the cursor is of no concern to the user when his purpose is only to \"control\" the position of the cursor; we have seen people adapt unknowingly to accidental situations where that mapping required them to move the mouse along an arc in order to move the cursor in a straight line.</div><br><div>That the mouse beat out its competitors, in our tests and for our application conditions, seemed to be based upon small factors: it stays put when your hand leaves it to do something else (type, or move a paper), and re-accessing proves quick and free from fumbling. Also, it allows you to shift your posture easily, which is important during long work sessions with changing types and modes of work. And it doesn't require a special and hard-to-move work surface, as many tablets do. A practiced, intently involved worker can be observed using his mouse effectively when its movement area is littered with an amazing assortment of papers, pens, and coffee cups, somehow running right over some of it and working around the rest.</div><br><div>One-Handed, Chording Keyset as Universal \"Function\" Keyboard</div><br><div>For our application purposes, one-handed function keyboards providing indvidual buttons for special commands were considered to be too limited in the range of command signals they provided. The one-handed \"function keyboard\" we chose was one having five piano-like keys upon which the user strikes chords; of the thirty-one possible chords, twenty six represent the letters of the alphabet. One is free to design any sort of alphabetic-sequence command language he wishes, and the user is free to enter them through either his standard (typewriter-like) keyboard or his keyset.</div><br><div>The range of keyset-entry options is extended by co-operative use of three control buttons on the mouse. Their operation by the mouse-moving hand is relatively independent of the simultaneous pointing action going on. We have come to use all seven of the \"chording\" combinations, and for several of these, the effect is different if while they are depressed there are characters entered -- e.g. (buttons are number 1 to 3, right to left) Button 2 Down-Up effects a command abort, while \"Button 2 Down, keyset entry, Button 2 Up\" does not abort the command but causes the computer to interpret the interim entry chords as upper case letters.</div><br><div>These different \"chord-interpretation cases\" are shown in the table of Appendix A; Buttons 2 and 3 are used effectively to add two bits to the chording codes, and we use three of these \"shift cases\" to represent the characters available on our typewriter keyboard, and the fourth for special, view-specification control. (\"View specification\" is described in [1].)</div><br><div>Learning of Cases 1 and 2 is remarkably easy, and a user with but a few hours practice gains direct operational value from keyset use; as his skill steadily (and naturally) grows, he will come to do much of his work with one hand on the mouse and the other on the keyset, entering short literal strings as well as command mnemonics with the keyset, and shifting to the typewriter keyboard only for the entry of longer literals.</div><br><div>The keyset is not as fast as the keyboard for continuous text entry; its unique value stems from the two features of (a) being a one-handed device, and (b) never requiring the user's eyes to leave the screen in order to access and use it. The matter of using control devices that require minimum shift of eye attention from the screen during their use (including transferring hands from one device to another), is an important factor in designing display consoles where true proficiency is sought. This has proven to be an important feature of the mouse, too.</div><br><div>It might be mentioned that systematic study of the micro-procedures involved in controlling a computer at a terminal needs to be given more attention. Its results could give much support to the designer. Simple analyses, for instance, have shown us that for any of the screen selection devices, a single selection operation \"costs\" about as much in entry-information terms as the equivalent of from three to six character strokes on the keyset. In many cases, much less information than that would be sufficient to designate a given displayed entity.</div><br><div>Such considerations long ago led us to turn away completely from \"light button\" schemes, where selection actions are used to designate control or information entry. It is rare that more than 26 choices are displayed, so that if an alphabetic \"key\" character were displayed next to each such \"button,\" it would require but one stroke on the keyset to provide input designation equivalent to a screen-selection action. Toward such tradeoffs, it even seems possible to me that a keyboard-oriented scheme could be designed for selection of text entities from the display screen, in which a skilled typist would keep his hands on keyboard and his eyes on the screen at all times, where speed and accuracy might be better than for mouse-keyset combination.</div><br><div>NOTE: For those who would like to obtain some of these devices for their own use, a direct request to us is invited. William English, who did the key engineering on successive versions leading to our current models of mouse and keyset is now experimenting with more advanced designs at the Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) of Xerox, and has agreed to communicate with especially interested parties.</div><br><div>Language, Skills and Training</div><br><div>I believe that concern with the \"easy-to-learn\" aspect of user-oriented application systems has often been wrongly emphasized. For control of functions that are done very frequently, payoff in higher efficiency warrants the extra training costs associated with using a sophisticated command vocabulary, including highly abbreviated (therefore non-mnemonic) command terms. and requiring mastery of challenging operating skills. There won't be any easy way to harness as much power as is offered, for closely supporting one's constant, daily knowledge work, without using sophisticated special languages. Special computer-interaction languages will be consciously developed, for all types of serious knowledge workers, whose mastery will represent a significant investment, like years of special training.</div><br><div>I invite interested skeptics to view a movie that we have available for loan [13], for a visual demonstration of flexibility and speed that could not be achieved with primitive vocabularies and operating skills that required but a few minutes (or hours even) to learn. No one seriously expects a person to be able to learn how to operate an automobile, master all of the rules of the road, familiarize himself with navigation techniques and safe-driving tactics, with little or no investment in learning and training.</div><br><div><br>SERVICE NETWORK</div><br><div>One's terminal will provide him with many services. Essential among these will be those involving communication with remote resources, including people. His terminal therefore must be part of a communication network. Advances in communicatiion technology will provide very efficient transportation of digital packets, routed and transhipped in ways enabling very high interaction rates between any two points. At various nodes of such a network will be located different components of the network's processing and storage functions.</div><br><div>The best distribution of these functions among the nodes will depend upon a balance between factors of usage, relative technological progress, sharability, privacy, etc. Each of these is bound to begin evolving at a high rate, so that it seems pointless to argue about it now; that there will be value in having a certain amount of local processor capability at the terminal seems obvious, as for instance to handle the special communication interface mentioned above.</div><br><div><br>EXTENDED FEATURES</div><br><div>I have developed some concepts and models in the past that are relevant here, see especially [5]. A model of computer-aided communication has particular interest for me; I described a \"Computer-Aided Human-Communication Subsystem,\" with a schematic showing symmetrical sets of processes, human and equipment, that serve in the two paths of a feedback loop between the central computer-communication processes and the human's central processes, from which control and information want to flow and to which understanding and feedback need to flow.</div><br><div>There are the human processes of encoding, decoding, output transducing (motor actions), and input transducing (sensory actions), and a complementary set of processes for the technological interface: physical transducers that match input and output signal forms to suit the human, and coding/decoding processes to translate between these signal forms in providing I/O to the main communication and computer processes.</div><br><div>In Reference [5], different modes of currently used human communcation were discussed in the framework of this model. It derived some immediate possibilities (e.g., chord keysets), and predicted that there will ultimately be a good deal of profitable research in this area. It is very likely that there exist different signal forms that people can better harness than they do today's hand motions or vocal productions, and that a matching technology will enable new ways for the humans to encode their signals, to result in significant improvements in the speed, precision, flexibility, etc. with which an augmented human can control service processes and communicate with his world.</div><br><div>It is only an accident that the particular physical signals we use have evolved as they have -- the evolutionary environment strongly affected the outcome; but the computer's interface-matching capability opens a much wider domain and provides a much different evolutionary environment within which the modes of human communication will evolve in the future.</div><br><div>As these new modes evolve, it is likely that the transducers and the encoding/decoding processes will be built into the local terminal. This is one support requirement that is likely to be met by the terminal rather than by remote nodes.</div><br><div>To me there is value in considering what I call \"The User-System, Service-System Dichotomy\" (also discussed in [5]). The terminal is at the interface between these two \"systems,\" and unfortunately, the technologists who develop the service system on the mechanical side of the terminal have had much too limited a view of the user system on the human side of the interface.</div><br><div>That system (of concepts, terms, conventions, skills, customs, conventions, organizational roles, working methods, etc.) is to receive a fantastic stimulus and opportunity for evolutionary change as a consequence of the service the computer can offer. The user system has been evolving so placidly in the past (by comparison with the forthcoming era), that there hasn't been the stimulus toward producing an effective, coherent system discipline. But this will change; and the attitudes and help toward this user-system discipline shown by the technologists will make a very large difference. Technologists can't cover both sides of the interface, and there is critical need for the human side (in this context, the \"user system\") to receive a lot of attention.</div><br><div>What sorts of extensions in capability and application are reasonable-looking candidates for tomorrow's \"intelligent terminal\" environment? One aspect in which I am particularly interested concerns the possibilities for digitized strings of speech to be one of the data forms handled by the terminal. Apparently, by treating human speech-production apparatus as a dynamic system having a limited number of dynamic variables and controllable parameters, analysis over a short period of the recent-past speech signal enables rough prediction of the forthcoming signal, and a relatively low rate of associated data transmissioon can serve adequately to correct the errors in that predictions. If processors at each end of a speech-transmission path both dealt with the same form of model, then there seems to be the potential of transmitting good quality speech with only a few thousand bits per second transmitted between them.</div><br><div>The digital-packet communication system to which the \"computer terminal\" is attached can then become a very novel telephone system. But consider also that then storage and delivery of \"speech\" messages are possible, too, and from there grows quite a spread of storage and manipulation services for speech strings, to supplement those for text, graphics, video pictures, etc. in the filling out of a \"complete knowledge workshop.\"</div><br><div>If we had such analog-to-digital transducers at the display terminals of the NLS system in ARC, we could easily extend the software to provide for tying the recorded speech strings into our on-line files, and for associating them directly with any text (notes, annotations, or transcripions). This would allow us, for instance, to use cross-reference links in our text in a manner that now lets us by pointing to them be almost instantly shown the full text of the cited passage. With the speech-string facility, such an act could let us instantly hear the \"playback\" of a cited speech passage.</div><br><div>Records of meetings and messages could usefully be stored and cited to great advantage. With advances in speech-processing capability, we would expect for instance to let the user ask to \"step along with each press of my control key by a ten-word segment\" (of the speech he would hear through his speaker), or \"jump to the next occurrence of this word\". Associated with the existing \"Dialogue Support System\" as discussed in [1], this speech-string extension would be very exciting. There is every reason to expect a rapid mushrooming in the range of media, processes, and human activity with which our computer terminals are associated.</div><br><div>REFERENCES</div><br><div>Ref-1.

Engelbart <br>Augmentation Research Center <br>Stanford Research Institute <br>29-Jul-75 12:43 (AUGMENT,33076,) </div><br><div>Abstract</div><br><div>NLS is an extensive system of computer aids being evolved toward supplying a coherent, comprehensive environment in which a knowledge worker can do all of his central, everyday work. Support for collaborative dialogue among distributed participants is one important component of the system.</div><br><div>The Journal is an NLS subsystem with basic methods for handling full-text computerized items that parallel those of open-literature professional journals and associated library services -- i.e. a permananent record of any published item, citation conventions by which later readers can retrieve and access references to other items, and catalogs and indices for retrieval aid. Each of these processes is done much faster in our computer environment, and other computerized services may be added. Altogether this provides a very powerful foundation for a new level of collaboration via recorded dialogue.</div><br><div>The Shared-Screen Telephone option for conference collaboration stems from a special \"connection\" feature in NLS that enables mutually agreeing users of Display NLS (DNLS) to connect through the computer system, sharing the same NLS control and display portrayal. When simultaneously talking on the telephone and making use of NLS's other extensive features, two people can confer very effectively at great distances.</div><br><div>Our experience with these \"teleconferencing\" provisions brings out two important points: (1) computer-aided teleconferencing is much enhanced when integrated coherently with effective computer aids for doing one's other knowledge-work operations, and (2) computer networks add critically important capabilities to this enhanced form of telconferencing.</div><br><div>Introduction</div><br><div>One purpose of this paper is to publish a note about two powerful modes of computer-aided collaboration; the other is to highlight a poorly appreciated factor regarding the utility to be derived from computer networks -- how these networks will facilitate human collaboration in a unique and powerful way.</div><br><div>The telconferencing features described in this paper are implemented as coordinated parts of NLS, the oN Line System developed at Stanford Research Institute over the past twelve years. A goal underlying the evolution of NLS is to provide an effective \"workplace\" in which a knowledge worker can keep his everyday working materials and do his everyday work. Providing him with a personalized, computerized workplace for \"core\" materials and tasks (akin to what his office provides for him) has been one of two main concerns. The other concern has been to develop a multi-computer, multi-tool framework wherein from this familiar workplace a user can reach through to access materials and tools from a rich marketplace of specialty services. We have a strong feeling that most people working in such an environment will want to reach through to work with other people at least as often as with computer services. References 1 and 2 provide useful framework fill-in regarding our goals and approach.</div><br><div>There are tens of thousands of hours of accumulated experience in using NLS to do real work, spreading back over a decade, with hundreds of people. The Journal system, with over twenty thousand items in it, is a regular part of the working culture for perhaps a hundred people. The Network Information Center (NIC) has been serving users of the ARPANET since 1971. We have been supporting remote NLS users over the ARPANET in steadily growing numbers -- for four years through the NIC services, and for the last year and a half through our Knowledge Workshop Utility service. The latter is a private, not-for-profit venture launched by SRI to provide subscribers with what for a very advanced system is a very solid computer service. The Utility brings NLS computer aids into terminals in the subscribers' offices for exploratory application by their people on their knowledge work. Also, the Utility has a staff of trainers that circulate between subscriber sites to help develop basic knowledge and skills, help iron out the problems in a group's evolution into different ways of working, and transfer application lore.</div><br><div>Our orientation and work methods have produced an approach to knowledge-workshop development and application that seems fundamentally usable for any special area of facilitation, i.e. whether it is for project documentation, intra-group collaboration, special-forms handling, correspondence, individualized bibliographic citation management -- or, for telconferencing. Our goal is to establish enough daily users of an advanced system so that a particular service sub-system (such as a mode of teleconferencing) can be tested and evolved in an environment which will closely resemble that of the future. As we see it, tomorrow's users will be people working purposefully on daily tasks in a computerized workplace, and the subject sub-system will be employed within a sequence of other-work operations that enrich the possibilities for harnessing it while providing a balanced view of cost, payoff, relative value among intangibles, and so forth.</div><br><div>Basic Description of NLS</div><br><div>NLS is a powerful, advanced system designed to support basic knowledge work. It has many noteworthy features. I will describe a sketchy few to support an image of the power derived from the dialogue-support applications featured here. (Reference 3 provides an introduction to the central set of NLS features.)</div><br><div>Access to the materials and tools in an NLS workspace can be via an online typewriter (using TNLS), or via a CRT terminal using a cursor-control pointing device (using DNLS -- our \"mouse\" is the main pointing device in use), or via a batched mix of input text and control directives for \"deferred execution\" (using the DEX subsystem). The control language and the display-terminal setup are designed for generality, application independence, and flexible growth of control vocabulary and task procedures.</div><br><div>A \"base\" set of features supports the most common activities, such as composing, studying, organizing, and modifying information. There are extensive provisions for editing text structured in hierarchic files, moving about within files via generalized addressing features, and flexibly creating parametric views to support rapidly shifting needs for studying or manipulating text. For instance, a common view shows only the text items in two particular levels of a hierarchically organized document, and only the first line of each item (whether header or paragraph). The CRT screen can also be split into different windows, where material from different locations (including different files) can be viewed simultaneously. Copying or moving selected items is as naturally performed between windows as within a window.</div><br><div>Different subsystems of tools, for special-application activities, are easy to develop and easy for a user to invoke. Some of these subsystems are maintained as standard \"tool kits\" by the Utility; others are created experimentally. Some special subsystems are for adjusting any of the extensive options that may be individually chosen for each user (equivalent to chair height, location of lights, telephone-ring loudness, and so forth); for compiling and debugging software; for hand-driven calculation (pointing to textual numeric data to be operated upon by your 'hand calculator'); and for locating user-reference material. In particular, one such special subsystem supports the Journal-submission process.</div><br><div>Recorded-Dialogue Systems</div><br><div>Consider a system such as is run by a professional journal within the service structure offered by our libraries. An author, by some process, gets an item published. This is followed by a particular series of processes and services.</div><br><div>Direct distribution -- Each person on a certain readership list is automatically sent a copy of the bundled set of items (issue of the journal) in which the new item is included by the batching process of journal publication.</div><br><div>Private hard-copy for personal use -- this is often desired. Office copiers now make this very simple (although with a slight tint of copyright illegality).</div><br><div>Storage, retrieval searches, and later access -- A reliable library system will get a copy and store it so that the copy can later be produced if asked for by an explicit, conventional identifier (e.g., Volume X of Journal Y). Other associated organizations (e.g. one's research department, or the orderly colleague down the hall who subscribes and saves) usually provide auxiliary means for gaining later access to the published document -- but let us consider all such under the statement that \"it is expected that with reasonable effort a person can later gain access to a specific item when its identifier is known.\" Some time after initial publication various indexing services provide support for retrieval searches. The journal and/or a related professional association may provide cumulative indexing periodically. These are available at a good library, where one can do a retrieval process to unearth likely citations, access the document, and walk away with a private copy.</div><br><div>Citation practices -- For a true dialogue to work within this system, careful conventions must be followed about citing previously published items. An important value derived from the above storage and access provisions is that when one author wants to write about the work of another, he can cite it explicitly in his text with assurance that his reader has a straightforward way to access the cited work. Where this cited-work accessibility is dubious, an author is considerably burdened.</div><br><div>Over a period of time the citations to prior works grow into a branching network that keeps earlier, relevant writings linked to present thinking.</div><br><div>The NLS Journal System</div><br><div>Our Journal system was conceived by this author in about 1966. I wanted an underlying operational process, for use by individuals and groups, that would help bring order into the time stream of the augmented knowledge workers. The term \"journal\" emerged early in the conceptualization process for two reasons: (1) I felt it important in many dynamic operations to keep a log (sometimes termed a \"journal\") that chronicles events by means of a series of unchangeable entries (for instance, to log significant events while evolving a plan, shaping up a project, trouble-shooting a large operation, or monitoring on-going operations). These entries would be preserved in original form, serving as the grist for later integration into more organized treatments. (2) I also wanted something that would serve essentially the same recorded-dialogue purpose as I perceived a professional journal (plus library) to do.</div><br><div>We established an explicit Dialogue Support System sub-module in our emerging concept of an \"augmented knowledge workshop\" system. The earliest thrust in this sub-module was the Journal. After several aborted starts, the current form finally began operation in the summer of 1970. It has served excellently. In our Center, we couldn't imagine doing without a service like this and still seriously claiming that we were using computer tools to best advantage.</div><br><div>Direct distribution -- A special NLS subsystem supports submission and subsequent distribution of the messages, memos, data records, or documents that become permanently \"published\" in our NLS Journal. An online directory file is maintained in which all of the \"registered\" dialogue participants are catalogued; each has a short, personal \"IDENT\" code (mine are my initials, \"DCE\") that can be found by simple interrogation of this directory. Groups can be given IDENTs also, and the IDENT of one group can appear in the membership set of another group. When one submits an item to the Journal System, he provides any number of IDENTS in a \"For Action\" category, and any number in the \"For Information\" category.</div><br><div>The IDENT directory contains for each recipient a specification as to where and how his \"mail\" is to be delivered. Each recipient has a specially designated \"mail box\" section in his mail-reception file. For a short item, a formatted citation header and a complete copy of the text are automatically delivered into this mail box. For longer items, only a citation is delivered, containing title, author IDENT, date and time of submission, any associated author comment, a tag for either \"Action\" or \"Info Only\" classification, and a computer-useable citation link to the full text. The recipient can follow the link to read the item online, or else to produce a hard-copy printout.</div><br><div>Private hard-copy for personal use -- An automatic hard-copy delivery option is available, although most users choose the \"online delivery.\"</div><br><div>Storage, retrieval searches, and later access -- Title and optional comments are provided at submission time. Many other cataloging elements may also be introduced. For example, a pre-assigned accession number (previously supplied by interactive request by the author with this submission subsystem) may be designated for those cases where cross-referencing is desired and one needs to determine a document's accession identifier before its submission time. The accession number of a Journal item being superseded by this new one may also be referenced, or special descriptors may be added.</div><br><div>If not handed a pre-assigned number, the Journal system automatically assigns a permanent accession number to a new item, sets up a catalog entry, and stores it in \"permanent\" archives which provide the same type of frozen record that traditional publication does. These archives may be accessed at any time, and the user may once again view the Journal item online, or make a hard-copy.</div><br><div>Citation practices -- If in reading an item online the user comes across a citation link to a passage in another Journal item, he can follow it directly to a specified passage in the cited item. In writing a Journal item there is a great feeling of freedom about citing other items, given these expectations of easy accessibility. This freedom fosters the use of very short dialogue contributions; when several succinct citation links, directed at specific passages, can be easily used for nouns in a sentence, one can communicate important contributions very quickly and easily.</div><br><div>The NLS Journal serves its users in a manner similar to professsional journals, with these significant quantitative differences: fast, flexible computer aids serve an author in creating a dialogue item, and help multiple authors to collaborate toward that end; publication time is very much shorter; significant \"articles\" may be as short as one sentence; cross-reference citations may easily be much more specific (i.e., pointing directly to a specific passage); catalogs and indexes can be accessed and searched online as well as in hard copy; and full-text retrieval with short delays is the basic operating mode. The end effect of these changes is a form of recorded dialogue whose impact and value has a dramatic qualitative difference over the traditional, hard-copy journal system.</div><br><div>Our Journal system has been in regular and increasingly heavy use for five years. First users were Center staff members, who approached its use with caution and mixed feelings. The accession numbers are in the 30,000s now -- probably 20,000 are used for Journal items and 10,000 for catalogued hard-copy items whose accession numbers are taken from the same sequence as the Journal numbers.</div><br><div>Since whole documents may be submitted to the Journal it is common practice to submit trial designs and thinkpieces, inviting comment that will appear as a collection of items that cite various sections (or the whole) of the trial piece and often cite other response items as well. Such a sequence has a function similar to other computer-message teleconferencing systems that record a \"conference session\". Here, though, any item may also be part of other \"sessions,\" or may have citation links to any item at large that a participant may feel is relevant.</div><br><div>At the option of the author privacy controls may be stipulated at submission time. Only those on the original distribution list may access the item, and the item will not appear in any of the public indexes.</div><br><div>The NLS Shared-Screen Facility</div><br><div>In this mode of teleconferencing, two or more people, positioned at separated display consoles, can link their displays so that all see the same image, and at option any can exercise control. When simultaneously talking on the telephone the resulting dialogue can be uniquely effective -- corresponding to an in-person conference around a collective assemblage of their scratch pads, working records, and individual support facilities. To add extra power to such sessions, special conferencing-aid tools and conventions can certainly be developed to advantage.</div><br><div>But consider the great potential already existing when some of the participants -- or even a single participant -- can effectively use computer tools to work with the relevant materials and processes. There is great value in merely conducting themselves as though they were congregated at a magic blackboard -- each easily able to pull forth materials from his notes or familiar reference sources, copy across into his private workplace any material offered from what the other brings forth, and actually demonstrate his own methods, conventions, and special skills, or demonstrate the circumstances where he has trouble and would like advice. There can be sessions for coaching, reviewing, mutual problem solving, demonstrating, etc. The more comprehensive and efficient the collective tools and skills are for doing a single individual's kind of work, the more effective such collaborative sessions can be.</div><br><div>Impact of Collaboration on Network Utility</div><br><div>Both of these types of collaborative dialogue will undoubtedly need to be generalized in the future. A computer-supported worker would like to connect to many differenct people in shared-screen, telephoning mode, eventually as a generalized option to telephoning. And sharing in recorded dialogue can't help but be an extremely important foundation for group effectiveness. We must acknowledge that the march of technology will allow us to record ever broader dialogue media for effective studying, and integration, leading to the day when a shared-screen telephone session, with full video connection of participants' images, can be captured in total, within digitized data forms, to be submitted as an item of recorded dialogue so others can later benefit from the record of the real-time conferencing.</div><br><div>Consider the mutual implications of these possibilities for technologically supported collaboration and the potential growth of computer networks. It is obvious that the richer the set of tools and online working practices of the participants, the more striking the value will be of either of these modes of teleconferencing, and therefore the faster the growth in seriously used collaboration techniques. Also, the value of the computer-held workplace will be considerably enhanced through networking to bring a dymanic marketplace into life.</div><br><div>It is obvious that the collaboration will not be served effectively by merely connecting the participants' terminals to each other, or even by connecting to each terminal through a common, central support system. What is necessary is broad-band interconnection between the processes of the participants' respective home workplaces. Other than with networks, how could this broad-band coupling sensibly be provided for collaborators whose home workplaces are supported in different machine systems?</div><br><div>Reference 4 provides a framework description of how a community of knowledge workers, joined in either a common mission or by a common discipline, could become considerably more effective if they availed themselves of a coordinated set of information services. The first-listed service is \"collaborative dialogue.\" The premise of the paper is that the data, computer processes, and terminals are tied together by computer networking; and the most basic issue is that the human resources--knowlede, skill, creativity, intelligence, and drive--are the important things to bring together. For human beings to collaborate effectively in the future through coordinated information systems, it seems unquestionable to me that computer networking is the inevitable foundation upon which communication will rest.</div><br><div>Acknowledgements</div><br><div>The research and development for the described work has been supported by several sponsors over tha past years: the Information Processing Techniques Office of the Defense Advanced Projects Research Agency has given strong basic support over the entire period; the Air Force's Rome Air Development Center has been a steady supporter; the Office of Naval Research provided key support for some of the particulars in managing Journal catalogs; NASA's Langley Research Center gave parallel support with ARPA during the Journal System's formative years.

Cupertino, CA<br>1978 (AUGMENT,71279,)</div><br><div>INTRODUCTION </div><br><div>Office Automation involves the planned application of integrated information handling tools and methods to improve the productivity of people in office operations. Although the handling of information by office people is the focus of this new technology, other aspects of the office will be affected. These include factors such as the organization of functions and lines of reporting, training for new methods, work space design, travel patterns, branch office location, home vs office work, hours of work, employee morale, and job classifications. Organizations that harness office automation products will need to deal with many more than just technological issues.</div><br><div>About 22% of the US work force is now in the office, with that percentage rising. Labor costs account for about 70% of the total office costs in our economy and salary costs are increasing about 6% each year. During the past 15 years there has been relatively little increase in productivity of the office work force, contrasting with the manufacturing sector where the average productivity has more than doubled (1). The cost of new technology aimed at increasing the productivity of office workers is going down, while the capabilities of office automation systems have been rapidly increasing.</div><br><div>The US \"white collar\" salary costs totaled $ 354 billion in 1974. This was divided into the following categories (2):</div><br><div>in $   <br>billions\t<br>Managers and Administrators:\t99\t28.0 %<br>Professional and Technical:\t150\t42.4 %<br>Other Clerical:\t83\t23.4 %<br>Secretaries and Typists:\t22\t6.2 %</div><br><div>Office automation will impact industry and government organizations in very significant ways with both COST DISPLACEMENT and VALUE-ADDED results. These two terms are now being used by people who are considering the potential payoffs of office automation to their organizations.</div><br><div>Cost displacement applications have the objective of achieving overall reductions in support staff costs or of increasing work volumes without adding support staff. Such applications typically center around WORD PROCESSING and provide the base for the more advanced value-added applications.</div><br><div>Value-added applications are viewed as being directed toward improving managerial and professional staff productivity (and effectiveness) through use of more integrated office automation systems that can directly affect their work.</div><br><div>The value-added approach deals with far more fundamental issues than the replacement of some support staff positions with word processing pools. Its focus upon individuals and groups of managers and professionals as targets for productivity improvement brings with it opportunities for significant increases in organizational effectiveness and major cost benefits in the largest segment of the office cost spectrum.</div><br><div>For any organization, management choices at many levels will affect the balance between reducing total office costs (cost displacement) or increasing the total office effectiveness (value-added effects).</div><br><div>Word processing applications have, until recently, been equated with the term office automation. It is interesting to note that, on the average, typing tasks comprise only 30% of the secretaries' and typists' work -- and thus account for only about 2% of the total office salaries (2). The next few years will see a very rapid growth in the introduction of advanced technology into offices and in applications with more impact on managers and other non-clerical people, bringing with it broadened perceptions of what office automation really includes.</div><br><div>Office Automation is likely to become one of the fastest-growing and most significant new industries of the century. It will apply electronic technology to a broad new set of applications and bring significant change to many of the ways in which people and organizations work -- AUGMENTING their capabilities and increasing both the quantity and quality of their contributions.</div><br><div>EVOLUTION OF AN AUGMENTATION SYSTEM</div><br><div>At SRI International (formerly Stanford Research Institute), I began explicit planning in 1959 for an R&D program toward augmenting the human intellect by use of computer aids. The Air Force Office of Scientific Research supported my study for several years, resulting in a publication that provided a conceptual framework and a basic strategy for a long-term program (3). In 1963 the Advanced Research Projects Agency began twelve years of continuous funding, during which there was also significant support from the Air Force Electronic Systems Division, NASA Langley Reseach Center, Air Force Rome Air Development Center, and the Office of Naval Research.</div><br><div>By 1968, we had a core system, called NLS, that was quite powerful for editing mixed text and graphics, for managing project-sized knowledge bases for design, documentation and financial activities, and for supporting group collaboration. This was described in a paper in that year's Proceedings of the Fall Joint Computer Conference, held in San Francisco (4). We also put on a real-time description and demonstration in a special session at the Conference, controlling the system from a work station on the podium, piping video to San Francisco from Menlo Park via two specially leased TV links, and projecting video images of mixed camera views and computer displays on an 18-foot screen. In the course of the session, we made considerable use of direct, shared-screen collaboration between me (on the podium at the conference) and different of my staff in our laboratory at Menlo Park.</div><br><div>In the following years, we added some basic features to further facilitate collaboration. We also concentrated heavily upon system architecture to facilitate the subsequent evolution of a coherent \"knowledge workshop\", with a command-language interface providing consistency and easy expansion, and a general facility for inclusion of \"foreign\" application systems as workshop tools even if they are programmed in other languages, or run in other computers under other operating systems.</div><br><div>By 1974, after eleven years of evolution, a considerably matured NLS was running under TENEX on a DEC PDP-10, and we initiated a subscription service to make this system available to user organizations. Computer service was supplied by a dedicated PDP-10, owned, maintained and operated by a commercial facilities-management company, on their premises, under contract to us at SRI. We had mostly government clients who used the ARPANET for access communication. We conceived of this as our \"Knowledge Workshop Utility service,\" providing a coordinated set of tools to support knowledge workers. We also emphasized personal support through field trainers and application consultants.</div><br><div>It may seem strange for a not-for-profit research institute to have fielded a commercial-grade service, but from a larger-system research viewpoint it was the only option: if we wanted to pursue significant augmentation results, it was absolutely necessary to have a community of real-world users. Within the whole augmentation-system domain, there are to be sure many significant technical problems remaining, but to my mind, by far the more numerous and challenging augmentation system problems lie in the human and organization domain -- to learn how to harness the services that technology offers, toward human ends. For this purpose it is necessary to have a significant number of people who are stably and skillfuly doing their everyday work with such tools, which requires in turn a solid, reliable set of computer-tool and people-support services.</div><br><div>In 1977, it was judged better to move the Utility-service and NLS-evolution activities out from the research-institute environment and into a suitable commercial environment. SRI advertised, entertained prospective bidders, made a selection, and negotiated a transfer of the business to TYMSHARE, Inc., of Cupertino, California. The system has been renamed AUGMENT, and is being marketed as part of TYMSHARE's integrated Office Automation services. Following is a brief outline of the features and services as brought over into that marketplace, organized under application areas of most relevance to the engineering-management theme of this conference.</div><br><div>DOCUMENT PRODUCTION</div><br><div>Almost all phases of any simple to complex document production process may be accomplished using AUGMENT. These include initial text entry by authors or by typists, editing, draft reviews (optionally printed-out), spelling correction, generation of tables of contents and indices, word counts, draft and final formatting (with provisions for graphics), routing for approvals, final proofing, printing or processing for photocomposition, and online filing (with electronic mail delivery optional).</div><br><div>AUGMENT features for document production include:</div><br><div>\tPowerful text editing, for example:</div><br><div>\t\tDisplay and hardcopy terminals<br>\t\tMouse and keyset (optional) for added efficiency<br>\t\tVery large set of integrated commands (tools)<br>\t\tCommands in logically grouped subsets<br>\t\tParagraphs (statements) as structural entities<br>\t\tHierarchically-structured files<br>\t\tFlexible file view presentations: level and line clipping<br>\t\tEasy cross-file editing<br>\t\tMulti-display window viewing<br>\t\tPowerful reference-linking<br>\t\tPlus many general features, such as:</div><br><div>\t\t\tFile privacy and integrity<br>\t\t\tOptional off-line text entry (also interfaces to other WP systems)<br>\t\t\tGeographically distributed user-access to AUGMENT system capabilities and working information through computer networks such as TYMNET and ARPANET<br>\t\t\tSpelling checking and correction<br>\t\t\tTables of contents<br>\t\t\tIndexing and word counts<br>\t\t\tPre-set and user-entered formatting<br>\t\t\tElectronic photocomposition<br>\t\t\tRemote collaboration during document development and production<br>\t\t\tDocument filing, control, and retrieval<br>\t\t\tCalculating<br>\t\t\tTable manipulation<br>\t\t\tSorting<br>\t\t\tMixed text and graphics<br>\t\t\tProofing<br>\t\t\tForms design and presentation for data entry</div><br><div>INTER-OFFICE COMMUNICATIONS</div><br><div>To complement AUGMENT's powerful document production capabilities, online messages or long documents may be transmitted through \"electronic mail\" facilities to other users of the system. There is also a unique \"shared screen\" feature where two remotely separated (e.g. across the country) users both can share in viewing and controlling the same screen image on their respective display stations while talking together on the telephone. These two capabilities, described in Reference (5), provide users with a very useful, new kind of \"dialogue support system\" that has the following features:</div><br><div>\tImmediate or delayed delivery of messages or references<br>\tIndividual or group distribution lists selected by the user<br>\tAction or information-copy specification<br>\tIdentification system for selecting distribution list data<br>\tTitle, special comment, author, clerk, descriptors, and other document-related information capture, transmission, and filing<br>\tPermanent filing of all messages and document for later retrieval<br>\tForwarding of items to additional recipients<br>\tIndices of public items by number, author, and title keywords, for online access or hardcopy printout<br>\tAutomatic indexing of individual recipients' mail by date<br>\tEntry of references to hardcopy documents for information and control purposes</div><br><div>PERSONAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT</div><br><div>The foregoing features introduce many facilities and methods which are very effective for other applications as well, such as the management of an individual's day-to-day personal, working information. This value is particularly dependent upon the level of usage. When access to the AUGMENT system occurs regularly, preferably daily, a user can keep items such as reminders, agendas, calendars, notes, telephone numbers, and to-do lists structured as he or she prefers within AUGMENT files. When these are coordinated with documents being written, electronic mail transactions, and access to other database information, most of an individual's daily business can be aided by use of the AUGMENT system.</div><br><div>ORGANIZATIONAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT</div><br><div>The document production and electronic mail features outlined above bring useful new capabilities into the office. The emphasis in those applications is on free textual information where the structural nodes are paragraphs, headings, citations, names, and addresses, etc. These may be retrieved by scanning text \"pages\" while viewing different levels in the hierarchy, or by searching for strings of text.</div><br><div>There is also support for more structured approaches to information management. Flexible data structures can be defined using the basic features of AUGMENT where retrieval may be accomplished in a number of ways. Retrievals are aided by designating text strings as the \"names\" of nodes during the creation of such data bases. Special file searching is provided on these names, and their use for labeling data elements provides a simple means for organizing linked and structured data files with relatively rapid retrieval.</div><br><div>A special form of organizational entity where AUGMENT can be of significant value is an \"engineering community\" (6). Instead of being a coherent element in a monolithic, hierarchical organization, a community (in this sense of the word) is composed of elements from a number of such organizations, where community membership is established by being in a common discipline or a common mission. Examples: a community of groups each of whom is involved in some aspect of solar-power R&D; or a community of groups all of whom have inter-related responsibilities within a large project (members all may belong to scattered elements within one organization, or there may be many members from different organizations).</div><br><div>SOFTWARE ENGINEERING</div><br><div>AUGMENT provides an exceptional environment for the development and maintenance of large software systems (7). The basic features discussed above are directly applicable to generating and managing the texts of specifications, source code, program libraries, and all levels of system documentation.</div><br><div>It should be noted that the hierarchical organization of AUGMENT's text files, the flexible level-clipping view control, and the built-in labelling features for paragraphs (statements) naturally support structured programming practices in a uniquely effective manner. [Under Air Force sponsorship, IBM conducted an evaluative study of NLS (AUGMENT) as a support system for their structured-program methodology (8). From the report's Abstract: \"This unique combination of capabilities can contribute positively to improved productivity and product reliability in programming development.\"]</div><br><div>There has also been continual evolution of debugging aids coordinated with the rest of the software engineer's \"workshop\" (9). With his workshop on Machine A, he has means for applying his full range of debugging tools in a uniform manner to debug processes on distant machines -- including distributed processes that pass control from one machine to another. These processes can be running in mixed types of machines, under mixed types of operating systems, and can be programmed in mixed types of programming languages.</div><br><div>EVOLUTION AND OTHER-SYSTEM INTEGRATION</div><br><div>Perhaps the most important aspects of the system's design are (a) flexible provision for evolution, and (b) the ability to interface \"through\" AUGMENT to other systems while retaining a consistent user interface style. The underlying system of AUGMENT is designed to allow for all of a user's different data bases and application-program services to be integrated into one, coherent \"knowledge workshop\" (10). A Command Language Interpreter, operating upon the compiled \"grammars\" from descriptions written in a Command Meta Language, provides unique uniformity and flexibility in the user interface over a wide variety of application systems (new or old) (11) (12).</div><br><div>There are internal provisions for a user's commands to evoke \"reach-through\" operations to other systems that may run on another machine, and/or run under a different operating system, and/or be programmed in a different language (13). Using the internal services of AUGMENT as his \"home workplace\" for preparing data or queries and for integrating remotely retrieved or processed data, a user may do a large share of the work related to other-system use within a familiar environment where fast, flexible study and manipulation are constantly used skills, and where special design attention has been given to the process of integrating information of varied form and source into working plans, reports, etc.</div><br><div>HIGH PAYOFF FOR LARGE ENGINEERING PROJECTS</div><br><div>In a \"joint, engineering and management\" domain, the potential payoff of comprehensive, integrated office automation systems would seem extraordinarily large when applied in a whole-system fashion to the support of large projects. Here, a strong element of VALUE ADDED consideration is introduced -- in this kind of application, there are significant NEW WAYS FOR PROFESSIONALS TO DO THEIR WORK.</div><br><div>As individuals, the planners, designers, documenters, managers, or expediters will find considerable support for their particular types of work -- as will the secretaries and clerks in the individual-work part of their support roles. But it is the impact at the organizational level, particularly for the distributed \"community\" form, where the special payoff will seem most dramatic.</div><br><div>Besides the basic capabilities outlined above, there have been developed special AUGMENT sybsystems directly relevant to support of an engineering community: for financial and technical management of multi-project programs; for developing, maintaining, and querying directories of people and resources within a large community; for producing highly formatted and indexed, quality-publication \"handbooks\" from the directory information; and for cataloging, indexing, and controlling an extensive collection of hard-copy items (documents, letters, catalogs, clippings, etc.).</div><br><div>And new subsystems are under development to add special support for: calendar management; large-program budget development and review; large-program requisition generation and control; and reach-through services to other-machine data-base management systems.</div><br><div>The capability is directly available to connect AUGMENT to existing special systems for supporting design, analysis, testing and manufacturing, integrating these tools smoothly into the engineer's \"coherent workshop.\"</div><br><div>For instance, selected diagrams, curves, and tables generated from these systems can be automatically integrated into an engineer's AUGMENT files as \"illustrations\" in his \"engineering notebooks\" -- instead of his pasting photographs or plotter sheets into a binder. Besides providng for flexible studying and evolution of the individual's \"notebook,\" the system enables flexible remote collaboration in developing plans, analyzing results, etc. And it is subsequently an easy matter to assemble selected components from this record for outputting through graphic printers to produce mixed, text-graphic documents (drafts, or high-quality productions).</div><br><div>A similar situation exists for managers within the large project: a valuable set of tools within AUGMENT providing a powerful \"home workplace\" with many special services to support the manager role; a capability for reaching through to other systems (e.g., PERT, IMS) and for integrating their products into the home workplace; and the multi-form means for communicating within the coherent, community working domain.</div><br><div>CONCLUSION</div><br><div>It is extremely important to note the multiple levels of synergism at work here:</div><br><div>The synergistic effect of integrating many tools into one coherent workshop makes each tool of considerable more value than if it were used alone -- for instance, the value of teleconferencing is very much greater when the participants are already doing a large proportion of their everyday work on line, so that any of the working material is available for selective citing and accessing, and when the users are already at home with the basic techniques of preparing and studying on-line material and of organizing and finding related passages.</div><br><div>And at another level, the synergistic effect of integrating many augmented individuals into one coherent community makes each element of augmentation of considerable more value than if it were applied just to support its one indiviual -- this is derived from the collaborative communication capabilities as applied through extended organizational methods to integrate the augmented capabilities of individuals into augmented teams and communities.</div><br><div>And finally, for any application of significant power -- of which augmentation of an enginnering project would be a good example -- the adaptability and evolutionary flexibility of the computer-communication system is extremely important. The working methods of individuals will shift markedly as they settle into use of a comprehensive workshop, and with these new methods and skills will come payoff potential for changes and additions to their workshops -- a cycle that will be significantly active for many years to come. A similar cycle will be even more dramatically evident at the organizational level.</div><br><div>An evolutionary approach seems the only viable alternative when the effects of a prospective change are not well known; and for many years to come this will be the case relative to the impacts of significant, prospective steps in office automation upon the operations of our organizations. We have an immense amount to learn about how people can better harness their basic capabilities toward individual and organizational ends.</div><br><div>It will be a long time before there is developed a stable framework within which to (a) design large next-step augmentation increments, or (b) plan an orderly transition for an organization that would adopt a large increment in one, discrete step.</div><br><div>Evolution of the service system, evolution of the indivual's working life, and evolution of the organization's working mode -- all must be provided for if an organization wants to capitalize significantly upon the potential of the technology that is arriving.<br></div>",

Cupertino, CA <br>29-Sep-82 19:26-PDT (AUGMENT,81010,)</div><br><div>INTRODUCTION</div><br><div>Among the on-line knowledge workers of tomorrow, there will be found as always a wide distribution both in personal motivation and flexibility, and in organizational roles and responsibility levels. In this view of the future, two things stand out for me: the workstations and work products of all of the workers must be inter-connected; and special roles for high-performance knowledge workers within this inter-linked organizational and informational network will be extremely important. This paper outlines a framework stemming from this perception toward developing high-performance knowledge workers as part of the evolutionary strategy of a knowledge organization.</div><br><div>In the early 60's when I began active, funded research in this area, well before the term \"Office Automation\" had emerged, I referred to my work as \"Augmenting the Human Intellect.\" (References [1] and [2] summarize events and results for me and my co-workers over the intervening years.)</div><br><div>About ten years ago I re-named our pursuit, after reading Peter Drucker's discussions [3] about \"knowledge workers,\" \"knowledge organizations,\" and \"knowledge industries.\" It seemed that a better term for the work would be \"Augmenting the Knowledge Worker.\" From this new perspective, a natural image emerged of a \"Knowledge Workshop\" as the place where a knowledge worker does his work and where, if we extended his tools, his means of collaborative communication, his working methods and his organizational roles, we could speak of an \"Augmented Knowledge Workshop.\"</div><br><div>WORKSHOP ARCHITECTURE</div><br><div>General Features</div><br><div>It seems inevitable that, as depicted in Figure 1, there will be a combination of local, high-speed networking (Electronic PBX and Local-Area Network) together with higher-level networks (private and public) which will interconnect workstations and the many tools and services within an organization's whole workshop. The effect will be as though there is a giant communication bus, where some elements seem far away (i.e. a slow or expensive communication path) and some seem very close (i.e. a fast and cheap communication path).</div><br><div>Figure-1. The workstations, computers and data bases for most large organizations will look something like this, and will connect to the outside world via at least one public network.</div><br><div>For the purposes of this discussion, let us put aside concerns for how much processing power and storage capacity should be built into the workstation, or where any particular programs or data should reside.</div><br><div>Let us instead consider the following principles, relative to supporting high-performance workers and integrating their capabilities into the larger organization:</div><br><div>Their workstations should have access to many tools and services, assumedly provided by a number of distributed sources around this network, including both those newly implemented and those that have long existed and will be slow to disappear.</div><br><div>The collection of tools and services for each worker must be integrated into a coherent whole into his \"augmented knowledge workshop.\"</div><br><div>Each worker should have access his full complement of tools, services, and personal working files from other workstations away from home base, even across the country so he can carry on with his work wherever he happens to be. (It would be a silly rejection of available communication technology to do otherwise.)</div><br><div>This whole arrangement must provide pragmatically for continuing evolution of command language, tool and service functions, terminal hardware, processor horsepower, application packages and their support computers, etc.</div><br><div>(See Reference [4] for a full development of such principles, and for the foundations for the architecture described below.)</div><br><div>Basic Organization of the Architecture</div><br><div>The over-all architectural approach that we adopted has four major components, as shown in Figure 2and summarized below. They are all operational today as part of Tymshare's AUGMENT system.</div><br><div>A User Interface System (UIS) to handle the interface between the user's terminal and the interactive programs. (References [5] and [6] provide a detailed description of the implementation and utilization of the UIS.)</div><br><div>The UIS takes care of all command-language dialog and all connection protocols. It also provides a uniform interface between the tool and the terminal to ensure that the user will (as nearly as possible) get the same treatment on a variety of terminals.</div><br><div>Figure-2. A user at a given terminal will \"see\" this kind of connection, looking \"through\" his UIS at his \"local workplace\" and beyond to the other, special tools that may be located anywhere on a connected network.</div><br><div>It interacts with an individual's user-profile file, to provide interface styles tailored to the needs and preferences of that individual.</div><br><div>It provides a reach-through service to non-AUGMENT systems, and can optionally translate between the command language of a foreign-program modules and a command language designed to meet the user's particular needs. The user's command languages as translated for a number of different \"foreign\" systems can be designed for mutual consistency, to provide an important coherence in language and function.</div><br><div>It provides an adaptation to different terminal characteristics, allowing users to access their work from different terminals, and enabling application programmers to develop their software as though it were to serve a virtual terminal.</div><br><div>A Procedure-Call Protocol (PCP) to provide for effective communication between processes on the network. (Reference [7] gives a thorough, detailed treatment of this \"PCP approach\".)</div><br><div>This protocol makes possible the implementation in each host of an application-independent, network run-time environment making remote resources accessible at the functional level essentially as though via a procedure call within a one-host application system. It greatly enhances the application programmer's flexibility; makes remote resources usefully accessible to other programs (not just to human users); significantly eases the problems of evolutionary changes within the network; and immensely improves the flexibility with which tools and services can be provided to the user.</div><br><div>A Core Workshop the user's own \"Local Workplace,\" a basic collection of tools and services that a knowledge worker generally needs, regardless of his professional specialty.</div><br><div>The user feels that this is his \"office,\" where in a familiar, consistent and effective environment he can do most of his editing, studying, information management, mail management, etc. The AUGMENT Backend was designed to provide these core functions (and in addition has many features which reward a practised user with significant gains in speed and flexibility).</div><br><div>The model in the user's mind is that he does most of his work here, and will \"reach through\" this \"home workshop\" to access other tools and services. There is special payoff for effective, flexible capabilities in this core workshop, where the user will spend a large proportion of his on-line time and can steadily acquire more of the available techniques toward higher performance.</div><br><div>Other Special Tools with their own file conventions, operating systems, etc.</div><br><div>A rich and ever-growing mix of data bases, application programs and special services will want to be \"reachable\" in a coherent manner by ever-more of the knowledge workers in a larger organization especially the higher-performance workers. It is important to support the evolutionary integration of these services into coherent, composite tools systems. AUGMENT's implementation enables application-support programmers easily to provide customized mixes of function and command terminology for special classes of users even for an individual user.</div><br><div>The general case, to be expected and probably encouraged, will find a variety of different hardware elements (terminals, personal computers, minis and large main frames, etc.) and a mix of software (different vintages, vendors, file conventions, terminology, user languages, help conventions, etc.).</div><br><div>Elements of the User Interface System4c</div><br><div>In Figure 3 are shown the main software modules (circles, ellipses) and support-file items (rectangles) involved when the User Interface System supports a user's access to a tool that is adapted for direct, \"procedure call\" service. The AUGMENT Backend is designed this way, and can work with full capability when the UIS and the Backend are separated by a network connection. This is true for any application system that has a procedure-call interface, regardless of the programming language and run-time environment, providing a suitable PCI module is implemented in its host computer to translate between the PCP and the particular procedure-call protocol for that application system.</div><br><div>Figure-3. When using the Procedure Call Protocol to interact with a backend tool, the User Interface System (UIS) will employ three special software modules and three special control files.</div><br><div>The main UIS module is the Command Language Interpreter (CLI), interpreting each action by the user and responding with screen-action feedback or calls to the Backend tools for service, according to the particular Command Language in effect.</div><br><div>There are likely to be many UIS-Grammar files lying around, each being a compact, specially coded specification of a particular Command Language. When attached to the CLI, a particular Grammar file determines the command terms and the feedback on the terminal screen, as well as the service-call and data-transfer interaction with the Backend tools.</div><br><div>For any given user, there will be one User Profile file attached to the UIS to specify the particular set of options which that user desires in the action of the CLI e.g. style of command recognition, amount and type of feedback, formatting defaults, initialization status, escape-code assignments to particular keys, etc.</div><br><div>It is an administrative decision whether or not a particular user is provided with commands for changing his profile file.</div><br><div>The Virtual Terminal Controller (VTC) module lets the rest of the UIS operate as though serving a standard, \"virtual\" terminal, translating back and forth to/from the signals of whatever \"actual\" terminal is connected.</div><br><div>The characteristics of the particular terminal are packed into the special \"Terminal Characteristic\" file one such for each different type of terminal that may be interfaced. For most of the modern terminals, this file is selected and installed automatically from interactions between the UIS and the terminal.</div><br><div>The UIS Process Communication Interface (PCI) allows the CLI to interact with the Backend tools making service requests and receiving the results as though it were making sub-routine calls in a \"virtual\" application-system environment.</div><br><div>In the general case, the UIS PCI would translate the UIS signals back and forth to/from a \"universal procedure-call protocol\" suitable for network interchange; a particular Backend tool (application system) would employ a version of the PCI that translates in turn back and forth to/from that tool's internally employed procedure-call protocol.</div><br><div>Foreign-System Reach-Through4d</div><br><div>Figure 4 shows the special provision for reaching through to \"foreign\" systems that do not provide a procedure-call interface i.e. systems that can only be utilized by character-stream I/O as from a terminal. The Reach-Through Interface is a special module that can be programmed for the specific character-stream interactions of a given tool for eliciting from the tool the equivalent results as expected by each procedure call sent to that tool by the CLI.</div><br><div>Figure-4. When interacting with a backend tool not equipped for procedure-call interaction, the UIS can employ either programmed interaction via its Reach-Through Interface (RTI), or provide the user with a direct, transparent connection.</div><br><div>In such a case, the UIS can interact with the Backend tool as though it (the UIS) were a terminal effectively translating between the CLI and the flow of characters back and forth to/from the tool, to call for service and to receive the results.</div><br><div>Seemingly inefficient, yet this \"programmed-interaction\" reach-through mode provides for an effective translation between the command language of that foreign tool and the UIS Command Language where the latter may be designed with verbs and nouns etc. to fit the special usage and to be compatible with the rest of the grammar, vocabulary, and conceptual-model characteristics designed to serve this class of users as their coherent knowledge workshop.</div><br><div>This enables the coherent integration of many older systems, many of which will live on for years.</div><br><div>As an alternative mode of interacting with a foreign system through its terminal I/O, the UIS can connect the foreign-system link directly to the Virtual Terminal Controller (VTC) to provide interaction as though the UIS were \"transparent.\"</div><br><div>Shared-Screen Conferencing</div><br><div>Figure 5 shows an interconnection mode, between two instances of UIS modules, whereby both terminals can share the screen content of one of them. Each VTC module converts the virtual-terminal screen image to the correct form for its connected terminal, so this shared-screen conferencing will work for dissimilar terminals.</div><br><div>Figure-5. When employing their respective UISs in the shared-screen conferencing connection, two or more users can collaborate closely on whatever job the \"showing user\" has going.</div><br><div>This mode is established in response to a suitable set of commands by the participants, and in principle any number of users can have such a connection made to their UIS modules so that User A can in real time show the dynamic workings of his screen to them all -- no matter what command language and tool system he is using.</div><br><div>At his option, User A can pass control to User B, thereafter what everyone watches are the effects of commands from User B's terminal and VTC acting through User A's CLI upon A's active jobs and files.</div><br><div>In its usual employment, this conferencing mode is used in conjunction with simultaneous telephone dialog. It will work between any two users connected by a network path. (Reference [8] gives a fairly complete description of an earlier form of this \"shared-screen teleconferencing.\")</div><br><div>THE OVER-ALL AUGMENTATION SYSTEM</div><br><div>The Categories of System Elements</div><br><div>Here, from my framework, are the major elements involved in \"augmenting\" our knowledge workers and their organizations. For this purpose, a \"craftsman\" metaphor seems directly applicable -- considering that our knowledge workers must be very much the professional craftsmen.</div><br><div>A. Tools: Craftsmen benefit from balanced collections of well-designed tools</div><br><div>B. Methods: To be effective, tools must be used with well-polished work methods</div><br><div>C. Skills: It takes practised skill to exercise a competent blend of tool and method</div><br><div>D. Knowledge: True craftsmen depend upon much integrated \"shop\" knowledge</div><br><div>E. Language of the Craft: Craftsmen need an effective language to discuss, teach, plan and collaborate among themselves (i.e. to do their \"shop talk\").</div><br><div>F. Training: To develop an effective group of craftsmen in a planned way requires explicit training, in all of the above elements</div><br><div>G. Organization: Role differentiation and organizational structure are necessary for integrating craftsmen effectively into an organization.</div><br><div>Tool System and Human System</div><br><div>For discussion sake, call Category A the \"Tool System\" and the aggregate of Categories B through G the \"Human System.\" We can immediately note that new technology, no matter how dramatic, contributes directly only to the Tool System.</div><br><div>Over the centuries there has been an immense amount of invention involved in the cultural evolution that brought the Human System to its present state. But its evolution took place with what will have to be described as a very primitive Tool System.</div><br><div>To take advantage of the absolutely radical, emerging Tool-System inventions, it is inevitable that evolution of the Human-System will begin to accelerate. In my view, this is strongly to be encouraged, since the power derived from the Tool System can only come from the way it is harnessed to human endeavors via the Human System.</div><br><div>Co-Evolution</div><br><div>The optimum design for either the Tool System or the Human System is dependent upon the match it must make with the other. There is a high degree of mutual dependence. But it seems that the Tool System is or soon will be \"out of control\" in the sense of our being able to design its target state, say for five years hence. And we possibly never will know how to \"design\" this Human System. So to be pragmatic about it, we can at best work in a \"guided-evolution\" mode for each of the sub-systems.</div><br><div>So, the ultimate capability of the larger \"Augmentation System,\" and therefore the performance level of the knowledge workers and knowledge organizations of the future, will improve only through the co-evolution of these two sub-systems. A disastrous default mode would be for the perceptions of the technologists and the market-oriented product planners to steer the evolution of the Tool System, and leave the Human System to adapt in its trail. There is no practical worry that the evolution of the Human System will drive that of the Tool System; it is inconceivable that the Human System could be served by analysts, inventors and entrepreneurs with the same fierce intensity as for the Tool System.</div><br><div>The practical worry is that there won't be enough perception of payoff from investing in explicit, conscious invention and evolution in the Human System, and that we will drift toward the above default mode.</div><br><div>It is something of a bind -- our culture hasn't really developed an acceptance for cultural progress to anywhere near the extent it has for progress in the technological and material sense -- and without a solid perception and acceptance that conscious evolution of such as this Human System (primarily a cultural matter) will pay off, we are not likely to become particularly effective at it. So it would seem that we need to invest an extra degree of attention and resource toward developing the perception that this Human System is not only acceptable but has a very high payoff. THEN we probably could get moving toward a balanced co-evolution.</div><br><div><br>SO, WHY TALK ABOUT HIGH-PERFORMANCE KNOWLEDGE WORKERS</div><br><div>There is a first-order answer to this question. It makes sense, at least from my viewpoint, to aim for a balanced distribution among the knowledge workers in an organization, in terms of the level of knowledge-work performance targeted for different roles. In this view then, a certain proportion of research, development and implementation investment should be made toward making really significant improvements. This would involve special attention for such roles, over both the Tool System and the Human System.</div><br><div>And there is also a very important, second-order answer. The most effective strategy that I can think of, toward developing the perception and acceptance of \"progress\" in the Human System, is to invest in pursuit of truly high-performance for selected knowledge-work roles. The best roles for this purpose would be those that would expose important stakeholders to the EXPERIENCE of truly high performance, by BEING THERE when that high performance is being exercised on activities relevant to their workaday world.</div><br><div>As a general strategy then, we would aim for specially equipped and trained teams to be connected into the workshop networks of large organizations, to perform roles that lend themselves best to early pursuit of especially high performance, and where there would be an appropriate visibility, identification, and sense of relevance for the organization's trend setters.</div><br><div><br>CONCLUSIONS</div><br><div>We can reasonably hypothesize that a startling degree of improvement may be obtained in the performance level of knowledge organizations and their individual knowledge workers. And further, that in order to obtain this we must attend to changes in both the Tool System and the Human System.</div><br><div>If this hypothesis were to be proven valid, it would be of immense importance for a problem-laden society to have acted on it. It doesn't seem that we would have to risk much to test it out over the next decade. A very small proportion of what is being invested in the \"easy to learn\" level of Office Automation, if explicitly directed toward pursuing high augmented-human performance, would have a notable effect.</div><br><div>Architectural features such as described above seem necessary anyway to support the natural evolution of Office Automation, even without any special emphasis upon high-performance workers. A salient point is that these features also can support the accelerated evolution of individuals and groups, who can still work effectively with the rest of the organization, but where through their own efforts or through planned investment by the larger organization they have extended more rapidly than the rest the development of their augmentation categories -- tools, methods, skills, etc.</div><br><div>And what is also important about these features is that they provide for the harmonious co-existence, within the same organizational environment, of knowledge workers of all levels of performance. The high-performance organization of the next decade must make do with many degrees of aspiration, talent and training, and must accommodate a wide spectrum in its workers' performance levels.</div><br><div>And it is also important to note that architectural characteristics of the organization's knowledge workshop will have a notable effect upon the co-evolution rate of that can be achieved.</div><br><div><br>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS </div><br><div>The concepts and the system described above have evolved over more than two decades, greatly aided by the research sponsorship of a number of organizations. Until 1978, at SRI International, research sponsorship by The Air Force Office of Scientific Research provided three years of critical conceptualization and planning support, from '59 through '62; DARPA's Information Processing Techniques Office, NASA, and the Air Force RADC contributed significantly until 1978, when SRI sold its rights to the system to Tymshare, Inc. There, while bringing it into the commercial market, the company has supported further conceptual and development work. During this more than two decades, probably a hundred different people have contributed directly, very significantly affecting the architecture and its implementation, and probably even affecting the way I see these things.</div><br><div></div>",

Cupertino, Calif.<br>(AUGMENT,80360)</div><br><div>INTRODUCTION</div><br><div>For over two decades, I have been actively committed to the pursuit of something that I initially called \"Augmenting the Human Intellect\" -- integrating interactive computer tools into the minute-by-minute activities of people over their whole range of think work. (The attached reprint, Ref1, summarizes events and results over this period.) I re-named the pursuit about ten years ago, after reading Peter Drucker's discussions (Ref-2) about \"knowledge workers,\" \"knowledge organizations,\" and \"knowledge industries.\" I decided that a better term would be \"Augmenting the Knowledge Worker.\" And, from that perspective, a natural image emerged of a \"Knowledge Workshop\" as the place where a knowledge worker does his work -- and where, if we extended his tools, his means of collaborative communication, his working methods and his organizational roles, we could speak of an \"Augmented Knowledge Workshop.\"</div><br><div>As to be expected, my viewpoint has steadily evolved over the years: many inter-related concepts and elements gradually settled into an ever-more comprehensive and consistent framework. In recent years, my pursuit has often been identified as belonging in the emergent fields of Office Automation and The Office of The Future. In a generally useful way, this is true enough. But there are frequent, large differences -- mostly stemming from differences in viewpoint. I think the major difference is that I have come to sense a much larger scale of opportunity and probable impact than I originally did. This paper attempts to summarize those aspects of my framework that relate to this issue of scale.</div><br><div>UNDERLYING CONCEPTS</div><br><div>My own perception of potential gain in human capability didn't clarify until I realized how pervasive and extensive were the things that our cultural evolution had already developed to augment our basic human capabilities. For me these developments boiled down to three main categories of \"cultural invention\":</div><br><div>Language -- how we conceptualize, attach labels and symbols, externalize, portray, model, communicate, ...</div><br><div>Artifacts -- physical gadgets -- tools, instruments, crutches, ...</div><br><div>Methodology -- procedures, methods, ways to organize people and resources, ...</div><br><div>For completeness, I found that I needed two other ingredients to fill out a \"whole augmentation system.\"</div><br><div>Skills and knowledge required for humans to harness these inventions (a matter of training);</div><br><div>Attitudes, spirit, beliefs, etc. required to make the system work (a matter of indoctrination).</div><br><div>Note that new technology, no matter how dramatic, contributes directly only to the Artifact category. Also, consider the immense amount of invention that over the centuries has been integrated into the other categories of our knowledge-worker Augmentation System.</div><br><div>So, if it isn't new to be bringing technology into our Augmentation System, what then will be so remarkable about introducing the new, computer-communication technology?</div><br><div>Consider the four, non-technology categories as comprising a \"cultural system, into which an immense amount of invention over the centuries has been integrated. Its scope, complexity and ingenuity transcend those of any system we humans know how to develop by explicit design, and engender within me a great respect for the effectiveness of \"organic\" cultural evolution.</div><br><div>For me then, much of the answer to the above question came from from one particularly important realization which emerged from this conceptual approach: elements within these different categories have a great deal of mutual affect upon one another's evolution; an innovation in the Artifacts category has almost always produced changes in the Cultural System categories -- such side-effect changes will usually follow as a natural means of taking full advantage of the initial innovation's potential.</div><br><div>When one considers the number and degree of the changes which this emergent technology can fruitfully introduce into our Artifact category, their quantitative effect portends a qualitative impact of unprecedented degree upon the whole, five-part Augmentation System.</div><br><div>Perhaps this is too sketchily presented -- but this type of conceptualization has been very important in shaping my viewpoint. A detailed treatment of these and other relevant concepts is presented in (Ref-3), also (Ref-4). For me, they are gaining in validity and significance every year, and still support very well the growing framework within which I perceive the possibilities and payoffs of augmentation.</div><br><div>A QUICK SKETCH</div><br><div>My viewpoint seems persistently to highlight the amount of organizational evolution that will have to be accommodated in the coming decades. This section provides some substantive imagery toward understanding what is in my mind in that regard. (These things are at the heart of what we have been working at for fifteen years.)</div><br><div>Consider a few of the things that the knowledge-worker professional (KW-Professional) must learn to do within his augmented workshop:</div><br><div>compose, study and modify the proposals, memoranda, plans, budgets, etc. that are his products; [Note: \"Study\" means much more to us than \"read.\"]</div><br><div>find earlier drafts and compare them with a current one;</div><br><div>send, receive, and keep track of his electronic mail;</div><br><div>solicit comments from his colleagues about a draft plan, then keep track of the comments and their cited passages;</div><br><div>manage his \"office-full\" of computer-held files, notes, lists, mail, reference pieces (e.g. office procedures, contract specs, or etc. against which he must work).</div><br><div>Consider also a knowledge-worker support person (KW-Support) -- tomorrow's secretary, stenographer, records manager, documentation specialist, staff assistant, etc.</div><br><div>Much of their support work will involve the same assortment of basic operations as for the KW-Professional above;</div><br><div>and we can expect special value in their supportive assistance to be derived from their being skilled in the application of specialized computer services (e.g. data-base querying and analysis, graphic-portrayal developing, copy editing, quality-document typography, etc.).</div><br><div>Now consider a type of support from this technology that generally doesn't get much appreciation -- a much-enhanced means for close collaboration among distributed workers. Here is what current technology can provide in this respect:</div><br><div>Fast, flexible electronic mail/messages: Where it is easy to formulate a short note, selectively including passages from other files, and distribute it to selected people. With a full mail service, one can send entire documents this way -- including graphic illustrations. A very useful option is to have a document or message be assigned a permanent accession number and then be stored in an official archive where subsequent access is guaranteed under that accession number.</div><br><div>Sharable work spaces: One's working records, notes, plans, etc. can selectively be made accessible to others with a new kind of flexibility and visibility. For example, a common occurrence is to send off a short, quick message saying, \"Check my passage in (Jones, Draft-Plan, 3B) to see if it meets the objections you expressed in (27143,6A5).\" [The first citation being to a specific passage in a private, working file; the second to a specific passage in a formally recorded, prior message or document.]</div><br><div>Shared-screen teleconferencing (Show-and-Tell Dialog): Consider two persons, working at a distance from one another, at their respective display screens (not necessarily the same brand of hardware, not necessarily working with the same computerized tools).</div><br><div>Assume that they are in telephone conversation and decide to shift to a more powerful dialog mode. Each of them elicits a conferencing set-up action from his computer, where for instance User A requests connection to User B for Showing, and User B requests connection to User A for Viewing.</div><br><div>Then on the screen at User B's workstation will be shown (as nearly as possible, depending upon the respective capabilities of their display equipment) what User A has on his screen. User B will be able to see what User A \"points\" to; User A can talk, point, and work in a normal fashion, doing a \"show and tell\" dialog with User B. At any time, User A can pass control to User B to reverse the flow of the show and tell dialog.</div><br><div>Assume that the interconnection processes for frequent collaborators can be preset for switching in and out of contact in a few seconds. Assume also that an almost arbitrary number of people can be connected into the conference hookup. Also, assume that there will be background, query-scheduling processes that can be used to facilitate the mutual arrangements that establish the time at which a conference session will be set up.</div><br><div>We can now appreciate that, besides the skills required by the Professional and Support persons to do their respective kinds of knowledge work, there will be a very important added set of skills -- how to interact closely in collaborating at a new level and degree of teamwork.</div><br><div>Consider how capabilities such as sketched above will affect the interplay between skilled professional specialists, and provide for the smooth integration of their respective contributions. Their \"group capability\" can be so much more flexible and efficient than ever before possible that we will have to re-consider our entire set of attitudes and beliefs about human teams or other organizational units -- about their possible working modes and potential effectiveness, about more-effective harnessing of special human talents, about extending the critical limits of complexity and urgency for the problems that human organizations can successfully handle.</div><br><div>All of the above-sketched scenario for an augmented organization is very real; more than this can in fact be supported with today's technology, and one assumes that tomorrow's offerings will at least provide as much.</div><br><div>QUESTIONS OF PERCEPTION</div><br><div>Here is a list of questions that are of special significance to my point of view:</div><br><div>What scale of gains do you see being derived from the adoption of this technology? (Productivity, capability, efficiency, performance, ... ?)</div><br><div>How much change will there be in the way we work? How much change will there be in skills and knowledge required for our jobs? How much time will you as an individual probably spend learning the new skills, knowledge, and ways of working?</div><br><div>How much change will there be within our organizations -- in structure, roles, and modes of interaction? How much time and cost will be involved in working out the major part of these organizational changes? How will this \"organizational cost\" compare with the cost of buying, installing and operating the new equipment?</div><br><div>This list suits me because of my particular viewpoint about the Office of the Future. I happen to believe (BELIEVE) that this is the start of a very large revolution -- bigger in qualitative impact than the combined effects of the printing press and the industrial revolution. In my view, the above gains and changes are going to be very (extremely) large. Please hold this in mind as you digest what I say.</div><br><div>One way to help illustrate my viewpoint is to talk about \"high performance\" for knowledge workers and for knowledge organizations. This is what has lured me on for many years -- the image of a new, much-enhanced level of capability for individual knowledge workers, and of startling gains in effectiveness for our knowledge organizations. In my framework, I much prefer to talk of \"augmenting\" rather than \"automating\" our individuals and organizations, because the principle value to me is in extending our capability for human-directed knowledge work, rather than in churning out our invoices with production-line efficiency.</div><br><div>Maybe they aren't fair, but these rhetorical questions convey something of my feeling: From these opportunities, do you picture a more-efficient ox cart or a more-effective vehicle (e.g. a jeep)? A more-efficient tablet-cutting chisel or a more-effective graphic writer/copier (e.g. a printing press)?</div><br><div>As you can see, my primary concern would better be characterized as pursuit of the organization of the future rather than of the office of the future.</div><br><div>ORGANIZATIONAL HILL CLIMBING</div><br><div>A useful metaphor, \"hill climbing.\" Each knowledge organization has to relocate itself, upwards through gradient lines of new skills, knowledge, methods and roles; struggling against the constant gravitational drag of uncertainty, the reaction to newness, the fatigue from unusual new exertions and postures, the false starts and wrong turns -- and the climbing energy can only come from within the organization..</div><br><div>In my view, the only feasible approach involves an explicitly chartered, full-time, internal organizational unit whose main work is to facilitate the organization's self-development. It provides planning, coaching in hill-climbing techniques, guiding, and general facilitation; but each of the other organizational units has to do its own scrambling and sweating to get its membership into a coherent new grouping up on the next level place.</div><br><div>There will have to be exploratory groups that are the first to establish themselves at new levels on new parts of the hill; theirs will be much more difficult transitions than for the following groups, and the larger organization has to subsidize these exploratory probes as a general expense within its whole-organization evolutionary costs.</div><br><div>\"Prototype\" efforts seem so important; and they can't be done using minimal service systems. They have to be considered as an exploratory investment. And, consider that the process of conducting the first such prototype activities will constitute an exploratory investment in learning how to conduct prototype activities.</div><br><div>SOME SOME ADMONITIONS</div><br><div>Do assume that everybody in the knowledge-work community within your organization will have a terminal that is connected within an organization-wide network; that every terminal can be in touch with any other; that every knowledge worker will potentially make use of service elicited from access to almost any data base or any person or any computer process in the organization.</div><br><div>Do assume that your organization's internal network will have communication gateways to public networks -- and that almost every worker within the organization will benefit from some kind of service derived through these public networks.</div><br><div>Don't fight the idea of making changes in people's ways of thinking and working; look at it as an opportunity to expedite our evolution.</div><br><div>Don't buy on tight requirements -- i.e. don't buy from the position of \"I want exactly this, no more and no less.\" Leave expansion room.</div><br><div>Do assume that your organization will benefit from an explicit, conscious effort applied to the process of its evolution, for at least the next decade -- and get to work upon an initial, important bit of organizational evolution, the creation of an effective, internal \"evolutionary mechanism.\"</div><br><div>Do assume that the important part of the organization's evolution is the human part -- the changes in skills, knowledge, methods, roles and organizational structure. These elements take much longer to establish or change than do new hardware or software parts of the system. These latter should be employed to SUPPORT the human-system evolution and operation.</div><br><div>Do realize that your human system will be strongly affected (and limited) by the hardware-software systems you buy. It is all too easy to let system acquisition wag the dog.</div><br><div>Do realize that you can throw away a hardware-software system, and roll in a new one; yes, they all will become obsolete and you can't keep waiting for the best one. BUT, understand that the associated changes in the human system will really be the important factors in summing up the cost vs. payoff of junking System A and installing System B.</div><br><div>ON MATTERS OF SCALE</div><br><div>The qualitative aspects of essentially every phenomenon will change as associated parameters shift in scale. Engineers long ago learned that their judgment and intuition could be drastically in error when the scale would be shifted beyond a certain range. Bridges and buildings collapsed and a Spruce Goose couldn't fly. And in natural systems, too -- a flea can jump to heights dozens of times its own size, but it couldn't even walk if it were scaled up to the size of a human.</div><br><div>After watching the man-computer thing from close up, for nearly thirty years, I am convinced that the matter of scale is a critical factor. Our earlier capabilities for judgment and intuition about the nature and effects of projected change simply aren't going to be applicable.</div><br><div>On the one hand, things that will start to change about our ways of thinking and working will catch us by surprise -- in the framework within which we grew up, they just weren't candidates for being changed. Also, shifts in phenomena-scaling (number and degree of changes) are moving us into a qualitatively different, whole-environment domain. For our intuition and judgment to continue serving us, they will have to be re-conditioned -- a process only accomplished by experience.</div><br><div>A PERSONAL FOCUS</div><br><div>I am turning my focus toward developing specially equipped and specially trained \"high-performance augmented teams.\" To produce examples and gain experience is the only way that I can see, today, to take on effective pursuit of the augmentation potential. A team, of from five to ten people, will serve as a prototype organizational model. Here, we can experiment with much higher levels of specialty skills and knowledge, and can work out effective modes of high-performance collaboration and new organizational roles. Conscious evolution in the whole-system character of a team can be carried out far more quickly and economically than with larger organizational units.</div><br><div>I also aim to awaken interest in some larger organizations that want to begin developing internal mechanisms and experiences for establishing an effective mode of organizational evolution -- gearing up for the \"hill climbing.\" Lets say that they are willing to start investing now toward evolving into a \"high-performance organization.\" As our laboratory begins to turn out a succession of working-prototype, high-performance augmented teams, we will want them to find active use in support of real-life organizational needs. The participating organizations will serve an important role in helping establish the application targets, and in providing field-test environments and constructive feedback. There seems to be good likelihood that the applications for such teams can be selected to provide very effective facilitation of the organization's hill-climbing process -- a sort of \"bootstrapping\" strategy.</div><br><div>Much of the development and experience represented in the attached reprint will be used as a base. With the \"integrative and evolutionary\" character of AUGMENT, we can for instance attach the highest-quality terminal equipment, very easily extend the computer horsepower per worker, and in a straightforward matter bring almost any existing software into \"reach-through\" access. And for any-sized extension of functional capability, our User Interface System enables us very flexibly to extend the command language and evolve in a powerful and coherent manner.</div>",

Engelbart<br>Tymshare, Inc.<br>October 25, 1983<br>Journal Document (OAD,2221,) </div><br><div><br>INTRODUCTION</div><br><div>AUGMENT is an integrated system of knowledge-worker tools that originated at SRI International over an extended period under the sponsorship of NASA, DARPA and RADC. (The system was then named \"NLS.\") Commercial rights were transferred to Tymshare in 1978, where it has since been enhanced and marketed as an integrated Office Automation system. A short history of AUGMENT's development may be found in [Ref-1], along with a summary of system characteristics and features.</div><br><div>The system evolved on time-shared, mainframe computers, and in a packet-switched network environment. In 1970 our computer was the second to be attached to the ARPANET, and since 1978 we have also operated extensively in the TYMNET environment. Special attributes of each the timesharing and the network environments contribute uniquely to the support of collaboration.</div><br><div>The architecture and general character of AUGMENT were directly oriented toward augmenting the capability of humans to deal with tough knowledge work and to process effectively the large volumes of information that burden the modern office. An explicit sub-goal was to support close, active collaboration among groups of workers. In this spirit, we volunteered to develop and operate the Network Information Center (NIC) for the original ARPANET user and research community, aiming to learn about collaborative support by really doing it.</div><br><div>Below are listed the primary community activities which we aimed to support in providing \"coordinated information services for a discipline- or mission-oriented community\" -- shown in the order recommended for evolutionary implementation. The rationale for the selection and ordering of these particular activities, and the approach for providing computerized support for them, were described in [Ref-2]:</div><br><div>A1: Collaborative Dialog</div><br><div>A2: Document Development, Production, and Control</div><br><div>A3: Research Intelligence</div><br><div>A4: Community Handbook Development</div><br><div>A5: Computer-Based Instruction</div><br><div>A6: Meetings and Conferences</div><br><div>A7: Community Management and Organization</div><br><div>A8: Special Knowledge Work by Individuals and Teams</div><br><div>The range of services conceived for this purpose had a major effect upon the system architecture and user features. However, the ARPANET user community grew much faster than was planned for, so this range had to be trimmed considerably and much less exploratory support development was carried out than was planned for. As a consequence, it was only for the first two of these activities that enough resources were available for developing significant computerized support.</div><br><div>[Note: The NIC remained at SRI when the rest of the Augmentation Research Center left, and is healthily serving a very sizeable community.]</div><br><div>This paper summarizes some of the principles, concepts and special provisions embodied in AUGMENT that most directly provide this collaborative support.</div><br><div>SOME GENERAL PRINCIPLES</div><br><div>When considering an array of candidate provisions for augmenting a knowledge worker's capability for doing his individual work, the question of skill level must be faced. In working toward enhanced human capability, there seems to be no substitute for the workers' skill in the utilization of their tools. That is, assuming the best efforts of equally competent tool-system developers, the system designed to support the more-skilled workers will always provide higher human performance than the one designed to support the less-skilled workers.</div><br><div>This principle holds true in the domain of computer-augmented collaboration also. The joint effectiveness of the collaborative group will benefit from the skills of all of the participants. And here there is a double level of skills involved: (1) skills of each person in employing computer support for doing individualized work; and (2) skills of each person at employing computer support for collaboration. The higher the group's skills at both levels, the more effective the group will be.</div><br><div>Some collaborative provisions may be employed by skilled users to support their collaboration with unskilled users -- and in some cases, skilled users may support collaboration between other, totally unskilled people.</div><br><div>AUGMENT TELEVIEWING</div><br><div>The remote televiewing provision in AUGMENT is an example of the latter provision, where skilled users can collaborate with lesser-skilled people, and indeed, can support collaboration between those who are totally unskilled in using the system's tools.</div><br><div>In this mode of teleconferencing, between two or more people positioned at separated display terminals, the screen image that is being produced for one of them by whatever computer tool(s) he is currently employing can also be simultaneously displayed on each of the other terminals.</div><br><div>This televiewing state is set up and controlled by executing commands in a special AUGMENT \"Conference\" subsystem. The Conference subsystem permits a user to call an on-line conference of two or more people, view and edit files, add and remove conferees, pass the gavel, and transparently connect to other tool-bearing machines via TYMNET or ARPANET. Televiewing is usually done in conjunction with a telephone connection, and is often used to support document review and revision in a synchronous mode, where all conferees can see and discuss changes as they are made.</div><br><div>This \"Conference\" subsystem, as with any \"tool\" in the AUGMENT \"workshop,\" will be accessed through the AUGMENT User Interface System (UIS) software module. The UIS modules serving the respective televiewing participants may be running in the same computer, or in different computers that are inter-connected by a network. (The relevant architecture which supports this AUGMENT televiewing capability is outlined in [Ref-3], along with a description of the major functions served by the User Interface System.)</div><br><div>One function of the UIS module is to support a variety of terminals for AUGMENT use. The UIS transforms the display views constructed by the tools into a form that works for the particular type of terminal equipment employed by each user. Therefore, there may be a variety of display terminals used by the different televiewing participants as they watch the common, \"shared view.\"</div><br><div>Control of the tool(s) that create and manipulate this shared view can be passed from one participant to another.</div><br><div>When simultaneously talking on the telephone, the resulting dialog becomes analogous to working around a shared blackboard, upon which individual, group, and public information can be manipulated with chalk and eraser that can be passed around among the participants. Among skilled participants, each is easily able to pull forth and share materials from his private notes or familiar reference sources and copy across into his private workplace any material offered from what the other participants may bring forth. He can demonstrate his own methods, conventions, and special skills, or demonstrate the circumstances where he has trouble and would like advice.</div><br><div>Typical session goals include coaching, reviewing, mutual problem solving, demonstrating, etc. The more comprehensive and efficient the collective tools and skills are for doing a single individual's kind of work, the more effective these collaborative sessions can be.</div><br><div>BASIC SUPPORT PROVISIONS: <br>IN-FILE ADDRESSING AND EMBEDDED LINKS</div><br><div>There are a number of unique characteristics in the structure of AUGMENT files, and in the associated provisions for manipulation and viewing. Generally, their purpose is to increase the facility with which files can be studied and manipulated, and to provide for mixed media (e.g. text, graphics, recorded speech). As mentioned above, increasing each individual collaborator's ability to study and manipulate working information will increase his ability to contribute in an augmented collaborative process.</div><br><div>The provisions in AUGMENT for flexible and explicit in-file addressing provide collaborative benefit not only through their enhancement of individual's capabilities, but also by direct support of collaborative activities.</div><br><div>Any given text entity in any AUGMENT file or document -- e.g. chapter, section, paragraph, word or even an individual character -- can be addressed explicitly by a string of characters that every experienced AUGMENT user can construct or read. These address strings may be optionally used in any AUGMENT command that designates an entity to be operated upon or a place in a document to do something about.</div><br><div>Selecting that entity or place by pointing with a mouse is always an option (and almost always would be employed if that entity or place is visible on the screen). But a user always has the option of using an address string to designate an entity or place that is not being shown. That entity or place may be in in any on-line document to which that user has appropriate access rights (including documents belonging to other users or to a public pool).</div><br><div>As an aid for specifying useful locations within a document, a user may affix a unique \"name\" of his own choice to any statement. When employed in an address string making it unambiguous which document is being cited, that name will serve to designate its named statement for any AUGMENT operation. Name examples: \"Ref-1\" names the first reference item below; and \"A3\" names the third activity item listed above.</div><br><div>If an address string is enclosed by parentheses or brackets, the whole is called a \"link.\" Examples: \" [Ref-1]\" is a link pointing to that item in the Reference section below; \"(OAC84-Draft,3B)\" would point to Paragraph 3B in the document file named \"OAC84-Draft.\" Links may be created and edited just as any other text, and may be embedded anywhere in the text of an AUGMENT document. They are understood by a reader to be a citation that \"links\" this location to some other document entity or place. It is useful to consider the address in a link as specifying a path leading to the cited object.</div><br><div>A reader who wanted to take a look at the place or entity at the other end of a link could execute a \"Jump (to) Address\" command and type in the corresponding address string -- whereupon AUGMENT would then change the view in a designated display window to be positioned in the designated document at the designated location.</div><br><div>Alternatively the reader could use a \"Jump (on) Link\" command, and merely: (a) point to the embedded link; then (b) point to the window in which he wanted the cited passage to be displayed. AUGMENT would extract the destination address from the link (instead of expecting the user to type it) and display the referenced passage in the indicated window. For instance, when reading the text of this OAC84 document on line, an AUGMENT user could do a Jump Link on one of the reference citations (which are bonafide links) and immediately be shown the associated citation statement.</div><br><div>A very useful, \"indirect addressing\" provision may be employed in a link's address string. This amounts to saying, \"when your path reaches Location X, scan along the text there until you find the next link, and then follow that second link to its destination.\" This provision may be employed through an indefinite number of indirect links. That is, this second link at Location X may in fact contain a similar indirect-address expression -- i.e. \"proceed to Location Y and follow the link you find there\" -- etc.</div><br><div>Example: \"(Ref-1.l)\". To follow this link, the AUGMENT Jump Link command would find the statement in this document that has been named \"Ref-1\" (in the Reference Section below), scan along that statement's text to the first link, \"(AUGMENT,71279,)\", and then follow that link. The user would be shown the opening section of document 71279 (from the AUGMENT Journal -- see below -- containing the complete text of the published document cited in [Ref-1]).</div><br><div>SHARED FILES</div><br><div>In timesharing environments, users have grown accustomed to being able to share the use of files in the process of collaboration. Users of stand-alone workstations and personal computers generally haven't benefitted from this. The emerging wide-band interconnection options (e.g. local-area networks and public, packet networks) and the integration of file servers into on-line working environments will bring shared-file collaboration into much more prevalence.</div><br><div>AUGMENT's architecture and general design philosophy assume this kind of working environment. Files containing the hierarchically stored information can be made available to any selected participants, utilizing a number of agreed-upon options for privacy and access. Geographical distances separating collaborators become transparent with remote computer access through networks.</div><br><div>By employing the above-described, embedded links, these files may be interlinked to create a shared network of information. A jointly developed document for instance begins with the entry of the ideas and continues with the elaboration of the idea nodes into a narrative by each member of the collaborating team. In the case of a single product by a team effort (a proposal, report, study, etc.), agreements must be made to control access to specific files.</div><br><div>The effect on the document as each person adds to, manipulates, and studies the common information is equivalent to passing around a paper draft for comments. But here the drafts are distributed very quickly and there is no retyping phase; the material can constantly reflect the latest modifications for all involved to see and use.</div><br><div>Expanded, shared spaces require some retrieval support, which can take many forms. For file sharing, the use of an on-line table of contents is generally pertinent. The table of contents for public files (or private subsets) consists of lists of titles and names of files, abstract-like descriptions, with links to desired nodes in each file. The table of contents (a \"locator\") is hierarchically organized, permitting categorical relationships and viewing that facilitate searching the locator.</div><br><div>Once any information is located (with one of many searching mechanisms), it is available for direct copying and integrating into any newly developing text. If plagiarism is a concern, there are protective measures to restrict access -- but when collaboration is the intent, the free availability of information to facilitate cooperation and collaborative synergism can be much enhanced.</div><br><div>AUGMENT automatically maintains an authorship-change record for each statement in each file, indicating the date, time, and author of the statement's creation or last change. This supports coordination among shared-file collaborators -- there are special AUGMENT provisions for viewing these records, and for scanning for statements entered or changed in a given time span or by a given author.</div><br><div>AUGMENT MAIL</div><br><div>As a component of our overall development activity, we have made heavy use of our own AUGMENT mail system since 1970, as well as interacting with many non-AUGMENT users through the ARPANET mail systems that have emerged since the early '70s. Today, an AUGMENT user can interact with people on these other mail systems (as served by either ARPANET or TYMNET) in a uniform way, along with his AUGMENT mail interactions, from within his coherent AUGMENT environment.</div><br><div>After thirteen years of hard-use evolution, the general features and provisions within AUGMENT Mail are probably as complete and sophisticated as any. The system provides speed and flexibility for all message-processing tasks, including composing, addressing, acknowledging, answering, forwarding, studying, and filing them. This allows our users to collaborate with high effectiveness.</div><br><div>There is a rapidly growing availability to on-line workers of various sorts of inter-personal message handling. The general benefit to collaborative work seems well recognized. Some of the features of AUGMENT add unique benefits beyond what seems generally experienced, and are worth mentioning here.</div><br><div>One unique source of benefit for AUGMENT Mail collaborators is that the content of a mail item is actually an AUGMENT document -- perhaps only a one-sentence document, but optionally a full-sized one. As such it carries structure, may include embedded graphics, may be directly copied into a recipient's document, etc.</div><br><div>And another unique benefit is derived from use of AUGMENT links. For instance, a simple, one-sentence message might be, \"Frank: Your comment in (Market-Bin, New-Plan, 4b3) seems to conflict directly with the boss's directive in (Division-Records, Dev-Policy, 7c).\" When Frank gets the message, he can hold this passage in one display window, and via Jump Link commands, put each of the cited passages into other windows for immediate study.</div><br><div>AUGMENT JOURNAL</div><br><div>Ongoing collaboration will benefit from provisions in addition to those for sharing files and handling mail. Dialogue implies a longitudinal series of transactions that are interrelated in various ways. For full support of task-oriented dialogue, a history of the dialogue is often valuable, and must be easily accessible through retrieval mechanisms.</div><br><div>The history should provide a chronicle of dialog \"transactions,\" i.e. a Journal. Within the AUGMENT system, there is provision for installing, maintaining and utilizing what we call Journal systems. A Journal system supports a recorded form of dialog having attributes similar to those provided to professional circles by the combination of their professional journals and the libraries that store, catalog and provide access to them..</div><br><div>Having created an on-line record of thoughts and ideas, the author (or a clerk) may direct the system to distribute it to a larger group. Such a contribution may range in size from a one-sentence message to a two-hundred-page document.</div><br><div>In submitting this contribution a document to an AUGMENT Journal, the author specifies a title, and may include comments (analogous to a preface or other notes attached to a report). A distribution list may be specified -- using the same personal and group identifiers as for AUGMENT Mail. Other fields will be added automatically upon submission, such as date and time. Less frequently used fields provide the computer with a basis for fairly complete bibliographical handling of this dialogue item. The author is given on-line computer guidance for easily filling out the necessary fields.</div><br><div>Upon submission to a specified Journal, the item is automatically given a number and is stored permanently in a central location. A full bibliographical citation will be generated and installed in library-like, computer-held catalogs. For each individual in the distribution list, a short citation will be delivered into his AUGMENT Mail box. One of the elements in this citation is a link pointing to the centrally stored Journal document. Using this link, a recipient may employ a simple Jump Link command to gain immediate access to the Journal document, and can study it or copy all or parts of it into working files.</div><br><div>For example, References Ref-1, Ref-2 and Ref-3 were stored in the \"AUGMENT\" journal, as their Journal-reference links indicate, and an AUGMENT user with Journal-system access may still retrieve those documents from the system. There are of the order of 100,000 entries in that \"AUGMENT\" Journal collection -- going back to August 1970.</div><br><div>This current document was entered as Item # 2221 into the more-recently established, \"OAD\" Journal collection. I exercised a Journal-system option and obtained a pre-assigned number so that I could include the number in the text of the document before final submission. Henceforth, another AUGMENT document may use the citation link \"(OAD,2221,A2)\" to cite the second \"activity item\" listed above in this document. A completely unambiguous citation, good for the indefinite future.</div><br><div>General access to the data base of Journal documents is through an on-line catalog. Searches through the cataloged citations can retrieve citations by author, accession number, title word, or key-word descriptor.</div><br><div>Subcollections for special groups or activity themes may be optionally maintained. Descriptors assigned at the time a document is submitted can classify it as belonging to a given \"conference\"; but such initial classifications needn't be restrictive, since at any later time a document may be published (in the Journal) which lists a set of documents and/or of passages, from among the entire prior collection of Journal items, which are deemed to be relevant to a given theme.</div><br><div>Or, a dynamic collection may be maintained by an interested party, in shared files, as a list of citations with links pointing directly to the items (documents or passages) in the Journal.</div><br><div>No one is able to modify the centrally held Journal document -- these documents are considered to be just as permanent a record as one that has been published and put into a library. If Journal documents are not accessed for a given period of time, they are removed from on-line storage and archived on tape. Later, if given the Journal accession number, AUGMENT operations will retrieve the item from archive tapes, just as a library would retrieve from its stacks if a little-used document had been removed from the open shelves.</div><br><div>The central storage of dialogue entries represents the recorded dialogue, including replies and cross-reference links -- essentially a network of interrelated submissions.</div><br><div>The Journal systems provide central storage for the same reasons that libraries do: it is too costly for each individual to maintain his or her own collection; and there is need for assurance that a specified document may be provided in unaltered form.</div><br><div>These Journal provisions encourage freer use by authors of commentary on prior entries, since an author knows that every reader has a simple means for accessing any of the earlier documents that may be cited.</div><br><div>A new participant, entering into an established dialog process, may simply be given a relevant set of citations to be brought completely into the picture.</div><br><div>Often, a passage in an earlier Journal document which was originally submitted as relevant only to a given theme or issue, will later be discovered by someone to be relevant to another, current issue. In this case, a new document may be entered into this newer \"dialog network\" that points out this relevance and provides a citation link to this old document, which now has become linked into the new dialog.</div><br><div><br>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</div><br><div>The principles underlying this work and the basic implementation of system architecture and features were done at SRI International, sponsored by the Air Force, NASA and DARPA, and contributed to by many bright colleagues in the Augmentation Research Center. Solid enhancements have been made to the Conference Sub-system, the Mail System, and the Journal System since AUGMENT was moved to Tymshare in 1978, with many good ideas contributed out of the experience of essentially the entire Office Automation Division.<br></div>",

Engelbart <br>Tymshare, Inc.</div><br><div>From COMPCON '84 Digest: Proceedings of the COMPCON Conference, San Francisco, CA, February 27 - March 1, 1984 (OAD,2250,).</div><br><div>ABSTRACT</div><br><div>AUGMENT is a text processing system marketed by Tymshare for a multi-user, network environment. In AUGMENT's frontend is a User Interface System that facilitates flexible evolution of command languages and provides optional command recognition features. Exceptionally fast and flexible control of interactive operations is enabled by concurrent action of mouse and optional one-handed chord keyset. Files are hierarchically structured, and textual address expressions can flexibly specify any text entity in any file. The screen may be divided into arbitrary, rectangular windows, allowing cross-file editing between windows. Many options exist for controlling the \"view\" of a file's text in a window, e.g.: level clipping, paragraph truncation, and content filtering. Structural study and modification of on-line documents are especially facilitated. A Journal system and \"Shared Screen Teleconferencing\" support collaboration among authors and their colleagues. Graphic illustrations may be embedded in the same file with text.</div><br><div>INTRODUCTION</div><br><div>AUGMENT was designed for augmenting human intellectual capabilities. It was targeted particularly toward the core work of professionals engaged in \"tough knowledge work\" -- e.g., planning, analyzing, and designing in complex problem domains. And special attention was paid to augmenting group collaboration among workers pursuing common goals.</div><br><div>Authorship has received a great deal of attention in AUGMENT's evolution, as one of the central human activities to be augmented. An important set of provisions within AUGMENT -- in its architecture, design principles, and specific features -- is directly aimed toward bringing high performance to the authorship activities of knowledge workers. For the purposes of this paper, we thus speak interchangeably of \"knowledge worker\" and \"author.\"</div><br><div>We recognize explicitly that highly skilled workers in any field, and knowledge work is no exception, are those with good command of their tools. Our basic design goal was to provide a set of tools that would not themselves limit the capabilities of the people using them. A system designed to encourage more skilled workers will always enable higher human performance than one designed to support less skilled workers.</div><br><div>In this regard, our design goal was to provide as much capability as possible for each level of system usage skill, and a continuous evolution path between skill levels. We believe firmly that knowledge workers are motivated to grow in knowledge and skill and that provisions in system design should support this. As the rest of the paper reveals, this approach translates into a rich set of AUGMENT provisions, aimed at providing speed and flexibility for skilled workers in organizing and pursuing their core knowledge work -- in which \"authorship\" is a primary activity.</div><br><div>An explicit sub-goal in AUGMENT's development was to \"augment\" the development, production and control of complex technical documentation -- through the whole cycle of gathering information, planning, creating, collaborating, reviewing, editing, controlling versions, designing layout, and producing the final documents.</div><br><div>This paper concentrates upon the development phase of this cycle. AUGMENT has well-developed tools to support the later, production phase, but their discussion is not included here.</div><br><div>Studying another's work provides a well-recognized challenge, but one of the toughest jobs is to study one's own work during its development: to see what it really says about Issue X; to see if it does provide for Concept Y; to see if it is reasonably organized and structured -- and to do these over a body of material before it is \"polished\", i.e., before it is well structured, coherently worded, non-redundant and consistently termed.</div><br><div><br>SOME BACKGROUND</div><br><div>History</div><br><div>AUGMENT is an integrated system of knowledge-worker tools that is marketed by Tymshare's Office Automation Division. The system was developed at SRI International over an extended period under the sponsorship of NASA, DARPA, and RADC. Commercial rights were transferred to Tymshare in 1978 (where the system has since been renamed from NLS to AUGMENT) and its evolution continued. A short history of AUGMENT's development may be found in <Ref-1>, along with a summary of system characteristics and features. The general R&D philosophy and the design principles behind AUGMENT'S development are laid out in <Ref-2>.</div><br><div>The system evolved on time-shared, mainframe computers, and in a packet-switched network environment. In 1970 our computer was the second to be attached to the ARPANET, and since 1978 we have also operated extensively in the TYMNET environment. We have benefited directly from both the time-sharing and the network environments in matters that are important to the authorship process -- especially in dealing with large documents and multi-party documentation activities. In 1976-77 we conducted some applied studies for the Air Force, as reported in <Ref-3> and <Ref-4>, which concentrated upon this latter application.</div><br><div>Relevant Architectural Features</div><br><div>Perhaps AUGMENT's most unique architectural feature is its User Interface System (UIS), a special software module, which handles the human/computer interfaces to all interactive programs. It takes care of all command-language dialog and connection protocols, and provides a framework for building a coherent and integrated user environment while supporting flexible evolution on both sides: on the user's side, with evolution of command function and terminology; and on the technology side, with evolving hardware and software. (Design details are outlined in <Ref-5>; rationale and utilization in <Ref-6>.)</div><br><div>The UIS provides a reach-through service to non-AUGMENT systems, and can optionally translate back and forth to a foreign program's command language. It also supports the shared-screen, remote collaboration capability discussed below.</div><br><div>AUGMENT's architecture provides for open-ended expansion and flexible evolution of system functionality and worker command languages.</div><br><div>It is assumed that for any class of knowledge workers, specialized application systems developed by other parties, perhaps running on other computers, will provide services worth integrating. The \"author class\" of worker should be no exception. Continuing evolution toward the \"author workshop of the future\" will certainly depend upon some such features in workshop architecture.</div><br><div>It provides adaptation for different terminal characteristics, enabling application programers to work as though with a virtual terminal.</div><br><div>File Characteristics</div><br><div>AUGMENT employs explicitly structured files, with hierarchically organized nodes; each node can contain either or all of: up to 2,000 characters of text, a graphic structure, or other forms of useful data (e.g., digitized speech). The worker has a definite model in mind for the structuring of any file that he works with; in composing and modifying it he can organize and modify structure using the same verbs as for working with text strings (e.g. Insert, Replace, Move, Copy, Delete), with appropriate structural-entity nouns (e.g., Statement, Branch, Group, Plex). For any existing hierarchical structure, he has many flexible alternatives for addressing its entities, modifying its organization, jumping around within it, and viewing it in a most beneficial manner.</div><br><div>(Note: AUGMENT workers generally use the term \"statement\" to refer to a file node, which is natural enough since the terminology became established before we added the graphic capability. Now an AUGMENT \"statement\" can contain either or both a text statement and a graphic diagram.)</div><br><div><br>CONTROLLING THE TOOLS</div><br><div>Many of AUGMENT's unique author-support provisions address basic operations common to almost every task, things done over and over again. These operations, executed with speed and flexibility, provide for composing and modifying one's working material, and for studying what is there over a wide range of substantive levels -- from a single text passage to a collection of end-product draft documents and their associated set of working notes, reference material, and recorded-message dialog (assuming all to be on line).</div><br><div>In the early stages of our program at SRI, we did a great deal of detailed work on what we called the \"control interface\" -- how users control the functional application of their tools. These details can be very important to \"low-level\" interactions which are done hundreds of times during a working day. Some of these details are quite relevant to bringing high performance to the authorship process.</div><br><div>AUGMENT commands are expressed with verbs, nouns, and appropriate qualifier words; every command word is designated by entering one or more characters. The UIS recognizes the command word from these characters according to the command-recognition options designated in each individual's \"profile file.\" Users seem to migrate fairly rapidly to \"expert\" recognition modes, where a minimum number of characters will elicit recognition of command words. The fully spelled-out command words are presented in the Command Feedback Window as soon as they are recognized. The Backspace Key will cause backup, one command word at a time.</div><br><div>Of the system requirements behind our choice of this noun-verb command form, two are particularly relevant here: (1) The \"vocabulary\" of the functions of the tools, and of the entities they operate upon, must be as extensible as is a natural language; (2) Textual lists of commands must conveniently lend themselves to writing, documenting, and executing as \"macro\" commands.</div><br><div>Screen selection is done with a mouse. If the command's noun is a single, defined text or structure entity, e.g., a \"word\", then there is only one selection needed (e.g., to pick any character in the designated word).</div><br><div>Besides using a standard keyboard for character entry, an AUGMENT user may optionally use a five-key, one-hand, chord keyset. Remarkably little practice is required in order to enter alphabetic characters, one hand-stroke per character. With less than five hours practice, a person can begin profitably working in a two-handed, concurrent mode -- operating the mouse with one hand and simultaneously entering command characters and short literal strings with the other hand.</div><br><div>Here is an example of a low-level action which reveals some basic characteristics of high-performance execution. It is a very simple situation, but representative of what is met over and over and over again in doing hard knowledge work. The worker is composing or modifying something in one area of the screen, when his eye catches a one-character typo in another area. For a skilled AUGMENT worker, the typo could be corrected in less time than it would take someone to point it out to him -- with three quick strokes of the keyset hand during a casual flick of the mouse hand, and an absolute minimum of visual and mental attention taken from the other ongoing task.</div><br><div>Fast, flexible, graceful, low effort -- these are important to all high-frequency, low-level, knowledge-work actions. This same kind of speed and flexibility are achieved by skilled AUGMENT workers in executing all of the other functional features described below. Description of mouse and keyset, and their concurrent employment, may be found in <Ref-7>.</div><br><div><br>ADDRESSING THE WORKING MATERIALS</div><br><div>There is a consistent set of addressing features that a worker may use in any command to designate a particular structural node or some element of text or graphics attached to that node. It adds appreciably to the power and flexibility of the system commands to have a rich, universally applicable vocabulary for directly addressing particular entities within the working files. Below are some examples.</div><br><div>Explicit Statement Addresses</div><br><div>There are four \"handles\" by which a given statement may be directly addressed:</div><br><div>Structural Statement Number. This designates the current \"structural location\" of the statement. It is assigned by the system, depending upon where the worker installs or moves a statement within an existing structure, or how that structure might have been re-organized subsequently. It is usually expressed as an alternating sequence of number-letter fields -- e.g. \"1\", \"1a\", \"1a1\", \"1a2\", and \"1b\". At a worker's option, these same statement numbers could be shown as \"1\", \"1.1\", \"1.1.1\", \"1.1.2\", or \"1.2\", but this bulkier alternative is seldom chosen.</div><br><div>Statement Identifier (or SID). This is a unique integer, assigned in sequential order by the system as each statement is first inserted, and which stays with a statement no matter how much its content may be altered or where it may be moved in its file structure. To make it uniquely recognizable for what it is, a SID is always displayed, printed, or designated with a prefixed \"0\" -- e.g., \"012\", \"0417\", etc. SIDs are particularly useful for referencing passages in a document while it is evolving.</div><br><div>Worker-Assigned Statement Name (or label). For any statement or part of the file structure, an author can designate as \"name delimiters\" a pair of characters that indicate to the system when the first word of a statement is to be treated as a name for that statement. For instance, if \"(\" and \")\" are set by the author as name delimiters for a specified part of the file, any parenthesized first word in a statement would be recognized by the system as that statement's name.</div><br><div>(Note: It is optional whether to have any of the above three identifiers displayed or printed with the statements' text.)</div><br><div>A Direct Screen Selection. When a statement to be designated is displayed in a window, usually the best way to \"address\" it is to use the mouse to position the cursor anywhere on the statement and depress the mouse's \"Select\" key (indicated below by \"<Select>\"). This mode is generally used for text manipulation -- selecting characters, words, numbers, visibles, invisibles, etc. (any of the text entities which have been made system recognizable).</div><br><div>Markers</div><br><div>As one \"holds a place\" in a book by leaving a temporary place marker in it, an author can place \"markers\" at arbitrary locations within an AUGMENT file. When placing a marker, he attaches it to a specific character in the text and gives it a name or label. Marker names are local to each file. Simple commands provide for displaying where one's markers are located and what their names are, for deleting or moving a marker, or for installing a new one.</div><br><div>A marker name may be included in an address expression, to provide another way of designating an address. A marker name can designate not only a particular statement, but a specific character within that statement. For example, \"Copy Word #x (to follow word) <Select>\" would designate that a word located somewhere in the file and marked with an \"x\" is to be copied to follow the cursor-selected word. There are many unique ways in which markers may be employed by an author who has integrated their artful use into her working methodology.</div><br><div>As a comparative example of some of the foregoing addressing forms, consider a statement whose SID is \"069\", whose statement number is \"3b5\", that has statement-name delimiters designated for it as \"NULL\" and \":\", that starts with the text \"Capacity: For every ...\", and that has a marker named \"x\" positioned on one of its characters. A command to move this statement could optionally be expressed as:</div><br><div>\"Move Statement <Select> ...\",</div><br><div>\"Move Statement 3b5 ...\",</div><br><div>\"Move Statement 069 ...\",</div><br><div>\"Move Statement Capacity ...\", or</div><br><div>\"Move Statement #x ...\".</div><br><div>Relative-Address Extensions</div><br><div>A sequence of characters may be appended to the address of a given statement to specify an address of a position \"relative\" to that statement. A major class of these designations deals with relative structural location, such as: Up a level, Down a level, Successor at same level, Predecessor at same level, Head at this level, Tail at this level, and End statement at last and lowest position in this branch. A period (\".\") in the address string indicates that relative addressing is beginning, and each of these relative-location designators is indicated with a directly mnemonic, one-letter designation.</div><br><div>For example, \"Move Statement 0609 (to follow statement) 4b.dt\" would move Statement 0609 to follow the tail statement of the substructure one level down from Statement 4b -- or, to conceptualize the associated address-location pathway, \"go to 4b, then Down a level and to the Tail\".</div><br><div>Embedded Citation Links</div><br><div>A special use of address expressions is within an explicit text entity that we call a \"Citation Link\" (or \"Link\" for short). Links are used as textual citations to some specific file item within the workshop domain. A link is delimited by parentheses or angle brackets and contains a valid address string whose path leads to the cited file entity. For example, \"(0306)\" or \"(4b.dt)\" are valid links. Also, the reference items at the end of this paper are statements named \"Ref-1\", \"Ref-2\", etc., and as such can be cited with links \"<Ref-1>\", \"<Ref-2>\", etc. An AUGMENT reader may travel via such a link directly to the referenced bibliographic citation.</div><br><div>A special feature in AUGMENT's link provisions is the use of \"indirect link referencing\". In path-following terms, including \".l\" in an address string stipulates, \"scan forward from this point to the next link, and follow that link to its target.\" For example, to follow the path prescribed by link \"(4b.l)\", one would \"go to 4b, then find the first link in that statement and follow the path that it specifies.\" This latter path in turn could prescribe use of another link, etc. There is no intrinsic limit to the number of these indirect links that may be employed in a given path -- only a natural caution against such a path looping back upon itself.</div><br><div>As an example, note that \"<Ref-1>\" is a link to the statement named \"Ref-1\", a bibliographic citation at the end of this paper. In that citation, there is a link to the original source document of the referenced publication, permanently stored in the AUGMENT Journal as Item 71279 (the Journal is described below). The point to be made here is that with the link \"<Ref-1.l>\", I can reference the original source document -- and a Jump Link command would \"take me there.\"</div><br><div>Text and Content Addressing</div><br><div>Other addressing options include scanning for a content match, and/or stepping backward and forward a given number of characters or words (or other text entities). For instance, the foregoing link could have involved a bit more smarts in designating which link to follow: e.g., the path for '(4b \"*D\" .l)' would be \"to 4b, scan for first occurrence of \"*D\", then follow the next link found in that statement.\"</div><br><div>Other-File Addressing</div><br><div>By preceding an in-file address string with a file address, and separating the two strings with a comma, one obtains a composite address designating a given entity within a given file. Extending this principle lets one prefix the file name with a directory name in which the file is to be found; and further, one can prefix this with a host-computer name.</div><br><div>For example, '(Office-5, Program-Documentation, Sequence-Doc, Specifications \"Journal\")' specifies the path: to the Office-5 host computer, to its Program-Documentation file directory, to its Sequence-Doc file, to its statement named \"Specifications\", and then scan to the location of the text \"Journal\".</div><br><div>If a person were working on the Office-5 host, he would only have to specify '(Program-Documentation, Sequence-Doc, Specifications \"Journal\")'. If he were already working within a file with its \"link default\" set to the Program-Documentation directory, he would only have to specify '(Sequence-Doc, Specifications \"Journal\")'. And if he were already working within the Sequence-Doc file, he would only have to specify '(Specifications \"Journal\")'. And if he were planning to reference items relative to the Statement named \"Specifications\" very often, he could affix a marker (e.g., named \"s\") to its front and would then only have to specify '(#s \"Journal\")'.</div><br><div>Or, suppose he were working in another file in a different directory on Office-5 and wanted to reference items relative to that same \"far off\" statement with special ease: in some temporary place in that file he could install a statement named \"Ref\" (for example) containing the textual link, \"(Program-Documentation, Sequence-Doc, Specifications)\". He could then cite the above reference with the link, '(Ref.l \"Journal\")'. This path description is: go to the statement in this file named \"Ref\", take the first link that you find there (traveling across intervening directories and files and statements), and beginning in the statement on the other end of that link, scan forward to the string \"Journal\".</div><br><div>This is only a cursory treatment, but should illustrate well enough what is meant by \"a rich and flexible addressing vocabulary.\" As with other high-performance features in AUGMENT, a beginner is not forced to become involved in the larger vocabulary in order to do useful work (with productivity on at least a par with some other, restricted-vocabulary system). But an AUGMENT worker interested in higher performance can steadily pick up more of the optional vocabulary and skills in a smooth, upward-compatible progression.</div><br><div><br>CONTROLLING THE VIEWS</div><br><div>A user of a book, or of most on-line text systems, is constrained to viewing the text as though he had a window through which he sees a fixed, formatted document. But as described below, our worker can view a section of text in many ways, depending upon his need of the moment.</div><br><div>Multiple Windows</div><br><div>For whatever total screen area is available to the worker, his general performance will be improved significantly if he can flexibly allocate that area into arbitrary-sized windows whose contents can be independently controlled. AUGMENT has long provided this basic capability, along with the provision that material from any accessible file may be shown in any window, and also that screen-select copying or moving can be done across the different windows.</div><br><div>(Note: Cross-file editing can be done at any time, between any two legally accessible files. If one or the other file's material or destination is not being displayed in any of the windows, one may always opt to employ a textual address expression instead of a <Select> within any editing command.)</div><br><div>User-adjustable parameters are used to control the view presented on the display. Adjusting one's view parameters is a constantly used AUGMENT feature that has solidly proved its value. To facilitate their quick and flexible use, the view-specification actions evolved into cryptic, single-character codes, called \"viewspecs.\" The syntax of all Jump commands (used for traveling) includes the option of designating new viewspecs, and a special combination of mouse buttons enables quick, concurrent, keyset action to change the viewspecs for a given window. Here are a few of the frequently used view controls:</div><br><div>Window Views</div><br><div>Structure Cutoff. Show only the statements that lie \"below\" this statement in the structure (i.e., this \"branch\"); or show only those following statements that are at this level or deeper; or show all of the following statements that will fit in this window.</div><br><div>Level Clipping. For the designated structure cutoff, show only the statements down to a specified level. Lower-level statements are \"clipped\" from the view; the worker can thus view just a selected number of the upper levels of his document/file.</div><br><div>Statement Truncation. For those statements brought into view (as selected by other view specifications), show only their first n lines. Truncation to one line is often used, along with level clipping, in order to get an effective overview.</div><br><div>Inter-Statement Separation. For viewing ease -- blank lines can be optionally installed between statements.</div><br><div>(Note: The foregoing view controls are extremely helpful when studying and modifying a document's structural organization.)</div><br><div>Statement Numbers and Names. Optionally, for a given window, show the Statement Number (or the SID) of each statement -- with an option for showing them at either the right or at the left margin. Independently, the showing of statement names may be turned on or off.</div><br><div>Frozen Statements. A worker may select a number of statements, in random order, and designate them as \"frozen.\" One of the view-specification options is to have the frozen statements appear at the top of the frame, with the rest of that window left for normal viewing and editing. The frozen statements may be edited, or even cross-edited between any other displayed (or addressable) statements.</div><br><div>User-Specified Content Filters. A simple content-analysis language may be used in a \"Set Content Pattern\" command, which compiles a little content-checking program. One of the view-specification options will cause the system to display only those statements which satisfy both the structure and level conditions imposed by other viewspecs, and which also pass the content-analysis test applied by this program. Where desired, very sophisticated content-analysis programs may be written, using a full-blown programming language, and placed on call for any user.</div><br><div>User-Specified Sequence Generators</div><br><div>In the foregoing, a \"view\" is created by beginning at a designated location in a document (file) and selecting certain of the the \"following\" statements for display, according to the viewing parameters -- possibly suppressing statements that don't pass the test of a content-analysis program. This is essentially a \"parameterized sequence generator,\" and provides very useful options for selectively viewing statements within a document; however, it works only by selectively discarding statements from a sequence provided in standard order.</div><br><div>Application programmers can provide alternate sequence-generator programs, which any user can invoke in a straightforward manner. In such a case, the apparent structure being presented to the user could be generated from a sequence of candidate statements according to any rules one may invent -- and the actual views could be further controlled by the above-described viewspecs for level clipping, truncation, content filtering, etc.</div><br><div>Perhaps the most commonly used, special sequence generator is one that provides an \"Include\" feature, where specially tagged links embedded in the text will cause their cited passages to be \"included\" in place of the Include-Link statements, as though they were part of this file. This provision enables arbitrary assemblage of text and formatting directives, from a wide collection of files, to represent a virtual, one-document, super file. For instance, the whole assemblage could be passed to the formatter, by means of a single user action, to generate a composite, photo-typeset document.</div><br><div><br>TRAVELING THROUGH THE WORKING FILES</div><br><div>An important provision in AUGMENT enables an author to freely \"travel around\" in his on-line file space to reach a particular \"view point\" of his choice -- i.e., the position within a file from which the system develops the desired form of \"view\" according to the currently invoked view specifications.</div><br><div>Traveling from one view point to another is accomplished by Jump commands, of which the simplest perhaps is a direct Jump to a statement designated by a screen selection. Then, for a worker grown used to employing address strings, a next form would be a Jump on an embedded link, or to a statement designated by a typed-in address string -- using any combination of the addressing elements and viewspecs described above. For example, the link \"<4b:mi>\" points to the Statement 4b, while invoking viewspecs \"m\" and \"I\" which cause the statements' SIDs to be displayed. The link \"<Ref-1.l:i;LL>\" points to the document referenced by the link in the statement named \"Ref-1\", invoking viewspec \"i\" for user content filtering, and sets the filter to \"LL\" to show only those statements beginning with a lower-case letter. The applications are effectively endless.</div><br><div>MODIFYING THE DOCUMENT STRUCTURES</div><br><div>Given the array of capabilities described above, it is very simple also to provide for very flexible manipulation of the file structure. For operating on a small, basic set of structure-entity nouns, essentially the same basic verbs may be used as for text manipulation -- i.e. Insert, Delete, Move, Copy, Replace, and Transpose are quite sufficient for most cases. For instance, \"Move Branch 2b (to follow) 3c\" immediately moves Statement 2b and all of its substatements to follow Statement 3c -- and their statement numbers are automatically changed from 2b, 2b1, etc., to 3d, 3d1, etc.</div><br><div>A few extra verbs are useful for structure manipulation. For instance, a \"Break\" command will break a given statement off at a designated point in its text string, and establish the rest of the text as a new, separate statement. And an \"Append\" command does the reverse -- i.e., it appends the text of one or more existing statements to the end of a designated statement.</div><br><div>A major source of structure-modification capability derives from the associated \"studying\" capabilities. For example, if an author can view a file (document) with specifications that show him only one line each of just those statements in the top two levels, he gets an overview of the high-level organization that helps immensely to study his current structure or outline.</div><br><div>Concurrent use of mouse and keyset also provide considerable gains in speed and flexibility for studying and modifying document structure. For example, if when studying the overview described in the previous paragraph, the author perceives that Statement 2b really belongs in Section 3, following Statement 3c, he can execute the necessary move command in a very quick, deft manner:</div><br><div>Keyset hand strikes \"m\" and \"b\" (for Move Branch), while the mouse hand is positioning the cursor anywhere in the text line of Statement 2b. [Two chord strokes.]</div><br><div>The mouse hand depresses the <Select> button on the mouse while the cursor is on Statement 2b, then moves to Statement 3c and depresses it again, and then depresses it again to say, \"OK, do it.\" [Three button pushes, synchronized with the mouse movement as it made two selections on easy, window-wide, whole-line targets.]</div><br><div>(Note: I just had myself timed for this above operation -- an unhurried 2.5 seconds.)</div><br><div>In our view, interactive computer support offers an author a priceless opportunity to get away from the geometric bondage inflicted by pages, margins, and lines -- things which have very little if any bearing upon the content and organization of one's text. In terms of value to the authoring process, we differ sharply from those who advocate a \"What you see is what you get\" working mode during the development of a document's content and organization. For this kind of work, experienced users of the foregoing kind of flexible facility for addressing, viewing, and manipulating structured documents, would consider a \"What you see ...\" mode as a relative handicap.</div><br><div><br>SUPPORTING MULTI-PARTY COLLABORATION</div><br><div>The support that advanced technology can provide for close collaboration among knowledge workers is a very important and much under-rated possibility. For multiple-author activities, collaborative support is an important aspect of system capability. Some years ago, we introduced the following provisions into AUGMENT. (A more complete, overview treatment of these is given in <Ref-8>.)</div><br><div>Electronic Mail. Its primary attributes of speed, automatic distribution, and computer-to-computer directness are well recognized -- and are generally accepted now as important to the effectiveness of knowledge workers. AUGMENT Mail has features that are beyond what most electronic mail systems offer, and which provide unique benefit to the authorship process.</div><br><div>AUGMENT's mail system allows one to \"send\" complete, structured documents as well as small messages. In an authorship environment, an important role for \"electronic mail\" is for the control and distribution of documents -- where small, throw-away messages are considered to be but a special class of document. An author should be able to bundle up any combination of text and graphics, in the forms that he has been using for studying and manipulating them -- and send the bundle to other workers. In AUGMENT, such a bundle is just like any other file structure, and can be studied and manipulated, incorporated into other files (documents), saved or deleted.</div><br><div>Recorded Mail -- AUGMENT's Journal System. When mailing a document, an AUGMENT worker may optionally specify that it be installed as a \"recorded\" item. In this case, before distributing the item, the system will make a permanent record if it, as a file in a specified Journal collection. And, just as though it had been published, this recorded Journal item cannot later be changed. The system assigns a straightforward accession identifier (a simple number), and any authorized worker is henceforth guaranteed access to that Journal item by specifying the name of the Journal-collection and the Journal-item number -- e.g., as specified in the link \"<OAD,2237,>\".</div><br><div>A given journal may be set up to serve multiple hosts and is much like a special library. It has its collection of documents, and AUGMENT provides associated support processes for entry, cataloging, retrieval, and access.</div><br><div>Together with the linking capability described above, a Journal system provides an extremely effective form of \"recorded dialog.\" Cross-reference links between a succession of Journal items produces an inter-linked network of collaborative contributions -- plans, outlines, document drafts, schedules, short comments, detailed critiques, reference material, etc. The on-line worker can follow these links very easily and, using multiple windows and flexible viewing options, can make very effective use of such records.</div><br><div>For instance, consider a detailed commentary directed toward a \"preliminary design\" document recorded in a given Journal collection. The author writing the commentary could view the design document in one window and his developing commentary document in another. He can easily establish links in his commentary to cite any passage in the design document -- e.g., a statement, a term in the statement, or a diagram. Then this author would submit his commentary into the Journal, perhaps specifying a list of colleagues for \"distribution.\" Each listed user would automatically receive a mail item announcing this new Journal entry, giving subject, author, date, etc., and the all-important link to the new Journal file containing the commentary. Any such recipient can subsequently study both the commentary and its cited planning document in a similar, multi-window, link-assisted manner.</div><br><div>Furthermore, this second reader could develop and submit his own recorded commentary, which because of the citation power of AUGMENT links could be as short and to the point as: \"Frankly, John, I think your comment in (DDD,xxx,aa) is a mistake! Didn't you notice the earlier assumption in (DDD,xxx,bb)? Maybe you should go back to Tom's earlier requirements document -- especially at (EEE,yy,cc).\" (Here, \"DDD\" and \"EEE\" represent Journal names, \"xxx\", \"yyy\", and \"zzz\" represent Journal item numbers, and \"aa\", \"bb\", and \"cc\" represent addresses pointing to specific passages in those Journal files.)</div><br><div>In official parlance, \"retrieval\" is the finding out about the existence of a relevant piece of information, whereas \"access\" is the subsequent process of gaining possession of the information. For users of AUGMENT's Journal system, retrieval is immensely facilitated by the widespread use of citation links. When one can follow them as easily as can a practiced AUGMENT worker, these links provide extremely effective retrieval support. We have supplemented this with some simple, automatically generated catalog files, which made a rather nice balance. Access is provided by direct Jump on a reference link if the file is on line; if it isn't, AUGMENT asks the worker if she wants it retrieved, and a simple affirmative response automatically launches a request for the system operator to retrieve the file from its archive tape, after which the worker is notified of its availability via electronic mail.</div><br><div>A private document can be submitted into a Journal. In this case, only those workers listed at Journal-entry time can get access to the central copy. Such a private item would not be listed or indexed in the \"public\" catalogs.</div><br><div>We have used the Journal system very heavily since 1970 to support AUGMENT's development activity; many customers have employed it heavily since 1975. There are about 100,000 entries recorded in the original Journal now (I don't know about other, newer AUGMENT Journal collections). We found that as workers became at home in this environment, they were increasingly free about submitting their items to the \"public.\" It became evident that the scientific tradition of active and open interchange has some solid relevance to the collaborative processes in our smaller, \"colleague communities.\" Time and again a worker would come across others' dialog and be able to contribute some valuable information (sometimes a one-sentence comment with a critical citation link). Often the payoff went the other way: the new party found immediate value in an old piece of recorded dialog.</div><br><div>Shared-Screen Teleconferencing. Consider a case where two people sit down to work together at a terminal, where they can both see the screen(s), and where either one can take over the controls. This is being done countless times every day throughout the country, in different combinations of expert-expert, expert-novice, novice-coach, etc. When talking together on their telephones, two or more distantly separated AUGMENT users can collaborate in a manner very similar to this.</div><br><div>Suppose that two workers, Smith and Jones, want to set up and operate in a Shared-Screen Conferencing mode. Smith is in Princeton, working on host Office-4, and Jones is in San Francisco, working on host Office-12 -- and both of these host computers are connected to the same network. Assumedly they are in telephone contact when they decide to work in this shared-screen mode to collaborate on Smith's current job.</div><br><div>Jones will enter the command \"Share (display with user) SMITH! On host OF12! Viewing (other display)!!\"</div><br><div>Smith will enter the command \"Share (display with user) JONES! On host OF4! Showing (this display)!!\"</div><br><div>To give these commands, each person only entered the characters shown in upper case (entry case actually irrelevant), plus the digits, plus an \"OK Key\" action where each exclamation point is shown.</div><br><div>Whatever tool that Jones is currently using will continue responding to his controlling actions, as evidenced by various feedback and portrayal actions in the windows on his screen. Smith's screen image will clear, and be replaced with a replica of Jones' screen image -- multiple windows and all. For the duration of the shared-screen session, Smith's screen image will continue to replicate what is shown on Jones' screen.</div><br><div>There are provisions for passing control back and forth between workers. For instance, Jones can pass control to Smith so that Smith can show him some material or method of work. There are also provisions for the subsequent entry and departure of other conference participants.</div><br><div><br>EMBEDDING THE GRAPHIC ILLUSTRATIONS</div><br><div>For complete support of document development, it is important to provide integrated means for developing, viewing, and manipulating graphical portrayals. These portrayals should be part of the working files from the very start, to be studied, passed about in mail, shared in Conferencing mode, edited, captioned, labelled, and moved about within the document structure. Furthermore, active, relevant citation links pointing to these graphical constructs would be installed in and followed from textual passages throughout the associated set of documents (including Mail and Journal documents).</div><br><div>AUGMENT's architecture and file structure were designed for this end, and a good bit of the associated implementation is in place.</div><br><div>A graphical data structure can be attached to any given file node, and there are basic capabilities for composing, studying, and modifying graphical diagrams. When formatting for a suitably equipped photo-typesetting device, there are formatting directives to designate the position and scale for placing these diagrams on a page. An AUGMENT file with integrated text and graphics can thus be mapped automatically onto a high-quality document whose pages contain both text and line drawings.</div><br><div>Our goal here was for what we call an \"illustrative graphics\" capability -- basic to which is a command that, when directed toward any conventional \"plotter\" file, will translate it into a diagram attached to a designated node. In this way we can make use of graphic constructs developed within almost any applications system, most of which have provision for outputting \"conventional\" plotter files.</div><br><div>The most important next step is to adapt a bit-mapped display as an AUGMENT workstation, so the integrated text and graphics can be viewed and manipulated on the same screen. Heretofore, to do graphic work, an author has had to attach a Tektronix 4014 storage-tube display to the special printer/graphic port of her AUGMENT workstation. This has made use of AUGMENT graphics slow and expensive enough to limit the number of user groups who have developed the integrated use of mixed text and graphics.</div><br><div><br>CONCLUSION</div><br><div>AUGMENT's unique provisions stemmed for the most part from the conceptual framework within which AUGMENT was developed. For instance, consider the pervasive and significant changes in the environment in which humans will be doing their knowledge work. Note that the habits, methods, conventions, intuitions, etc., that comprise the \"ways\" in which we think, work and collaborate, are for the most part products of many centuries of cultural evolution -- in a radically different environment. With a radically different environment, this constant process of cultural evolution can be expected to take some radical turns.</div><br><div>The AUGMENT developmental framework assumed that many of these \"ways\" are candidates now for change in directions that heretofore would not have been beneficial. The AUGMENT system emerged as a first step in considering a few such changes, which perhaps can improve human capability for doing knowledge work because their new \"ways\" will enable us more effectively to harness the new tools toward more effective basic capability. (This is very different from trying to \"automate\" our old \"ways\" of doing things.)</div><br><div>As an example, consider the \"What You See Is What You Get\" (WYSIWYG) syndrome. It is a highly touted feature for many vendors. It provides a definite advantage for the final process of converting a computer-held document to a nicely formatted hard copy. But what does it do for authorship? Well, in our framework, it has a negative impact. We were happy to abandon those constraints of lines and pages and other formatting geometry which did not contribute to matters of content and structure. We have chosen instead to provide the authorship process with structured files, flexible addressing, flexible window-size viewing, level and truncation viewspecs, etc. -- things that would be awkward or impossible to provide in a WYSIWYG environment. This provides the authorship phase with flexibility and power for studying and manipulating content and structure that we wouldn't consider trading off for WYSIWYG. Save it for the production phase.</div><br><div>Here is another bit of culture that deserves re-examination. Consider the dictum, \"Easy to learn, and natural to use.\" Or, \"User friendly.\" The question is, for whom are you judging that things will be easy, or natural, or friendly? For designers of craft-work tool systems, very different perceptions of this issue are warranted between a system for the occasional, weekend do-it-yourself person and a system to be heavily used day after day by professionals. The AUGMENT User Interface System enables us easily to configure either kind of a tool collection.</div><br><div>This paper describes part of what is provided to professional knowledge workers who do a significant amount of authorship work. We observe no more difficulty in their learning how to employ this relatively large collection of tools than one would expect for professional woodworkers in their learning about the relatively large collection of chisels and other tools of their trade.</div><br><div>It is a basic part of our framework that, to augment human knowledge workers, attention must be given not only to tools, but to methods and skills as well. Because of space limitations, the scope of this paper was restricted to a summary of those tool provisions within AUGMENT that especially facilitate the authorship process. A full description of \"How to use AUGMENT to ...\" would definitely need to include methods of work that effectively harness these tool provisions, and the special kinds of skills that yield unique payoff in executing these methods. This is true for every tool system, of course, but it seems especially true in this case because many AUGMENT provisions do not fit into the general cultural background of our authorship process.</div><br><div>Perhaps the best way for very brief summarization of what AUGMENT's users feel about its unique features is simply to say that those who leave its working environment really miss them.<br></div>",

        "full": "<div>When I left Glen's group, I spent a year working for Lytton Industries on the ground control system supporting a precursor to Skylab. Then I went to a conference that was being held up in San Francisco. It was the Fall Joint Computer Conference. This particular conference was very, very special for me and for a lot of people because there was an hour and a half session in which Douglas Engelbart from the Augmentation Research Center at SRI in Menlo Park, California, gave a live video demonstration of a highly interactive computer graphics and computer text manipulation system that had been developed at SRI. I went to that particular session not knowing what to expect, and I was completely blown away. I happened to find afterward the particular person who seemed to be in charge technically; his name was Bill English. I cornered him and said, \"This is really nifty and I think I can help you.\" And he said, \"We're looking for a few good men. Why don't you come by?\" The next week I went by and the personnel department said, \"No, we have no openings.\" I said, \"Wrong. I'm going to sit here until Bill English comes to talk to me.\" (I was fairly bold in those days.) And he did. They hired me, and it was the beginning of a seven-year effort on my part at SRI with Doug Engelbart. A great many of the concepts that people now think of as commonplace, like the mouse and multiple windows, editing across windows, integrated text and graphics all those things originated, from my point of view, from Doug and his group at SRI. I'd like to introduce Doug Engelbart and his perspective of the last 20 years or so. </div><br><div>Doug Engelbart is a pioneer in the design of modern interactive computer environments. He holds the patent on the mouse; created the first two dimensional editing system, and was the first to demonstrate such things as the use of remote procedure protocols, mixed text graphics, and shared screen viewing. Doug holds a B.S. in EE from Oregon State University and a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of California at Berkeley. His career has led him from the U.S. Navy as an electronics technician to NASA's Ames Research Laboratory and then to Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) where he led the team that designed and built the NLS \"Augmented Knowledge Workshop.\" From January 1977 to March 1984 Doug was a Senior Scientist at Tymshare, Inc., Cupertino, California. In 1984, Tymshare was acquired by McDonnell Douglas. Doug continues as a Senior Scientist in the Information Systems Group, promoting the type of integrated system architecture conceived and implemented by him at SRI International.</div><br><div>The story of my involvement with on line workstations begins in early 1951 with a vision and a lifetime professional commitment. Over 34 years of pursuit have created a lot of personal history, and the object of this historical exercise, the workstation, occupies a unique place in it. For me, a workstation is the portal into a person's \"augmented knowledge workshop\" the place in which he finds the data and tools with which he does his knowledge work, and through which he collaborates with similarly equipped workers. I consider that the large system of concepts, skills, knowledge, and methods on the human side of the workstation has to be taken into account, in a balanced way, when pursuing increased human effectiveness. So, my workstation history story embraces a rather large sphere. The task of writing an historical piece is unfamiliar enough to cause me difficulty by itself, but the associated stirring of old records and old memories has added a nearly overwhelming burden of dreams, event s, people, stresses, pleasures, disappointments the firsts and the failures. </div><br><div>Now, what from all of this and how to organize it will make an appropriate \"history\" paper? I could provide a solid measure of objective reporting events and dates. I have been an involved observer of related computer history since 1951. I watched and experienced how the supportive hardware, languages, and architecture evolved; witnessed the people and efforts that brought timesharing into being; and was even more closely involved with the emergence of computer networks. Through all of this, I was wholly focused on what these things could do for people at workstations. And then there was office automation and personal computers; you don't have to be an old guy to have watched these emerge, but I'm sure they looked different to me than to most. I could also provide lots of objective reporting about the events and dates associated with the things I have caused or had a direct hand in. There seems to be a lot there that is quite relevant to this \"history of the workstation\" theme. It was dusty, laborious work, this process of brainstorming for candidates, culling and ordering and trying to describe them in some reasonable sequence and context. But what I came to realize is that there is one, clearly dominant factor that underlies essentially every cause for any uniqueness that I might list for historical record. It isn't a technology, it isn't a science, and it isn't a marketing or business mode l. And I am going to give it dominant coverage in this paper. It is what I call my \"Framework.\" </div><br><div>My Framework is based upon an intuitive conviction, implanted in my head (apparently permanently) over 30 years ago, that the gains in human knowledge work capability that we will achieve by properly harnessing this new technology will be very large. Metaphorically, I see the augmented organization or institution of the future as changing, not as an organism merely to be a bigger and faster snail, but to achieve such new levels of sensory capability, speed, power, and coordination as to become a new species a cat. Based upon this conviction about huge potential gains for mankind, my Framework explains for me generally where such gains are going to come from, and provides strategic principles that can help guide a conscious pursuit of these gains.</div><br><div>I was several years out of school, possessing a B.S. in electrical engineering and two years' experience during World War ll (halfway through college) as an electronics technician. I was doing odd job electrical engineering work at Ames Research Laboratory in Mountain View, California, with the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA, forerunner of NASA). For several months I had been devoting most of my spare time to searching for professional goals; for some reason I wanted to invest the rest of my heretofore aimless career toward making the most difference in improving the lot of the human race. I had initially dashed off in many fanciful directions, but yet managed enough interludes of reasonably sober thinking to build up some useful, strategic generalizations. Retreading myself professionally, to become proficient and then extraordinarily productive in some new field wasn't worth considering without a significantly attractive scenario, embedded in a reasonably structured strategic framework. The high payoff scenarios all seemed to involve creating or joining something that, however disguised, would essentially be a crusade. Crusades have many strikes against them at the outset. </div><br><div>In particular, they don't connect to a normal source of government or business revenue. They don't have nice organizational frameworks. You can't go out on the streets and expect to find financial, production, or marketing vice-presidents interested in the crusade. Moreover, even if you accomplish the sweeping change that is the ultimate objective, chances are that in this very complex world the side effects might be bad enough to make you wish you hadn't tried. Suddenly, up through all of this delightful, youthful abstraction bobbed the following clear realization: The complexity of the human situation was steadily increasing; not only that, but its rate of increase was increasing. Along with the increasing complexity had come a general increase in the urgency associated with the more critical problems. If one invented a measure for each of these complexity and urgency then for a given problem, the product of its complexity times its urgency would represent a fair measure of the difficulty mankind would find in dealing with that problem.</div><br><div>The imagery of FLASH 3 evolved within a few days to a general information environment where the basic concept was a document that would include mixed text and graphic portrayals on the CRT. The imagery carried on to extensions of the symbology and methodology that we humans could employ to do our heavy thinking. There were also images of other people at consoles attached to the same computer complex, simultaneously working in a collaboration mode that would be much closer and more effective than we had ever been able to accomplish. Within weeks I had committed my career to \"augmenting the human intellect.\" In a few month s, I left the NACA and enrolled as a graduate student at UC Berkeley, where Professor Paul Morton had started a computer science activity (although it would be many years before universities began calling it that). He was several years along in developing the California Digital Computer (CALDIC). Within a few years I had to accept the fact that research on any kind of interactive computer applications would not provide me with a program acceptable to the university community for Ph.D. and later faculty pursuit. So, I settled for something else, got my Ph.D., and went to Stanford Research Institute (SRI) where I hoped ultimately to promote support for an augmentation program.</div><br><div>That was 1957. By 19591 was lucky enough to get a small grant from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR, from Harold Wooster and Rowena Swanson) that carried me for several years not enough for my full time work, but by 1960 SRI began pitching in the difference. It was remarkably slow and sweaty work. I first tried to find close relevance within established disciplines. For a while I thought that the emergent Al field might provide me with an overlap of mutual interest. But in each case I found that the people I would talk with would immediately translate my admittedly strange (for the times) statements of purpose and possibility into their own discipline's framework. When rephrased and discussed from those other perceptions, the \"augmentation\" pictures were remarkably pallid and limited compared to the images that were driving me. </div><br><div>For example, I gave a paper in 1960 at the annual meeting of the American Documentation Institute, outlining the probable effects of future personal support use of computers. I discussed how a focus on personal support would change the role of their future systems and how such a change would enable more effective roles for the documentation and information specialists.' I received no response at all at the meeting. One reviewer gave a very ho hum description of the paper as the discussion of a (yet another) personal retrieval system. Later, during a visit to a high caliber research outfit, an information retrieval researcher got very hot under the collar because I wouldn't accept his perception that all that the personal use augmentation support I was projecting amounted to, pure and simple, was a matter of information retrieval and why didn't I just join their forefront problem pursuits and stop setting myself apart?</div><br><div>Then I discovered a great little RAND report written by Kennedy and Putt' that described my situation marvelously and recommended a solution. Their thesis was that when launching a project of interior new discipline nature, the researcher would encounter consistent problems in approaching people in established disciplines. They wouldn't perceive your formulations and goals as relevant, and they would become disputative on the apparent basis that your positions were contrary to \"accepted\" knowledge or methods. The trouble, said these authors, was that each established discipline has its own \"conceptual framework.\" The enculturation of young professionals with their discipline's framework begins in their first year of professional school. Without such a framework, tailored for the goals, values, and general environment of the respective discipline, there could be no effective, collaborative work. Furthermore, if such a conceptual framework did not already exist for a new type of research, then before effective research should be attempted, an appropriate, unique framework needs to be created. They called this framework creation process the \"Search Phase.\" </div><br><div>So, I realized that I had to develop an appropriate conceptual framework for the augmentation pursuit that I was hooked on. That search phase was not only very sweaty, but very lonely. In 1962, I published an SRI report entitled, \"Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework.\" With the considerable help of Rowena Swanson, this was condensed into a chapter of a book published in 1963.J I can appreciate that these framework documents appear to many others as unusably general and vague. But, for me, the concepts, principles, and strategies embodied in that framework look better and better every year. The genesis of most of what was and is unique about the products of the augmentation work can be traced back to this framework, which I'll return to later with a fuller description.</div><br><div>I submitted many proposals before getting support to pursue the augmentation program outlined in the Framework report. Among the stream of politely phrased regrets, there was one that, in contrast to today's environment, can provide useful perspective on the environment of 1961. Four high  quality civilian experts had been enlisted by one agency as a site visit team a brain researcher, a psychologist, and a computer expert and for me it was a very enjoyable day's dialog. But the subsequent letter from the agency informed me regretfully that (paraphrased) \" . . . since your interesting research would require exceptionally advanced programming support, and since your Palo Alto area is so far from the centers of computer expertise, we don't think that you could staff your project adequately.... \" When J. C. R. Licklider (\"Lick\") came from Cambridge to take over ARPA's newly formed Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) in late 1962, 1 was figuratively standing at the door with the \"Conceptual Framework\" report and a proposal. There the unlucky fellow was, having advertised that \"man computer symbiosis,\" computer time-sharing, and man-computer interfaces were the new directions. How could he in reasonable consistency turn this down, even if it was way out there in Menlo Park? Lick moved very swiftly. By early 1963 we had a funded project. </div><br><div>But, whereas I had proposed using a local computer and building an interactive workstation, Lick asked us instead to connect a display to the System Development Corporation's (SDC's) ANIFSQ32 computer, on site in Santa Monica, to do our experimenting under the Q32's projected new time-sharing system. (Converting the Q32 to be a timeshared machine was SDC's IPTO project.) Later that year, our project was modified to include an online data link from Menlo Park to Santa Monica, with a CDC 160A minicomputer at our end for a communication manager, supporting our small display workstation. For various reasons, not uncommon in pioneering ventures, that first year was very unproductive relative to the purposes and plan of our project. Lick was willing to put some more support into the direct goal (more or less as originally proposed), but the support level he could offer wasn't enough to pay for both a small research staff and some interactive computer support. </div><br><div>Mind you, the CDC 160A, which was the only commercially suitable minicomputer that we knew of, even though having only 8K of 12-bit words, and running at about 6 microseconds per instruction, cost well over $100,000 (1963 dollars). It had paper tape in and out; if the system crashed, you had to load the application program from paper tape, and the most recent dump of your working file (paper tape), before you could continue. A crude, industry-standard Flexowriter (online typewriter) could be driven; otherwise it was paper tape in and out. What saved my program from extinction then was the arrival of an out-of-the-blue support offer from Bob Taylor, who at that time was a psychologist working at NASA headquarters. I had visited him months before, leaving copies of the Framework report and our proposal. I had been unaware that meanwhile he had been seeking funds and a contracting channel to provide some support. The combined ARPA and NASA support enabled us to equip ourselves and begin developing Version 1 of what evolved into the NLS and AUGMENT systems. Paul Fuhrmeister, and later Eugene Gribble of NASA's Langley Research Center, had to stick out their necks as successive heads of Langley's large computational division to support the direction and supervise NASA's support for our program, which continued several years after Taylor left NASA to join ARPA's IPTO office. Our ARPA support grew and was fostered by Lick's successors Ivan Sutherland, Bob Taylor, and Larry Roberts. </div><br><div>Meanwhile, the Air Force's Rome Air Development Center, at Rome, New York, began to supply supporting funds. By 1967, it was recognized that the respective contributions from ARPA, NASA, and RADC represented significant parts of a coordinated program. The other agencies began funneling their funds through RADC, which served for many years to both monitor and manage our contracts, as well as provide their own significant share of support funds. John McNamara and Duane Stone provided strong support and contract liaison from RADC. NASA support ended by 1969, and ARPA and RADC provided significant support until 1977, although from 1974 the funding became even more for supporting applications and developments for other organizations, for targets formulated by others (e.g., the National Software Works). The continuing pursuit of augmentation along my strategic vector virtually stopped.</div><br><div>An historically important organizational cluster emerged at Stanford Research Institute in the 1960s, peaked about 1974, and was scattered in 1977 with a small core carrying forth in a commercial (and then industrial) environment to the present. I t grew by ones and twos from 1963, as it collected \"permanent\" members from the SRI technical staff, and recruited new ones from the outside. By 1969 I believe we were about 18 strong; this grew steadily until by 1976 we totaled about 45. In 1973 we made two explicit subgroups, one headed by Dick Watson doing development of software (and some hardware), and one headed by Jim Norton handling operations and applications support. SRI was organized by divisions, each containing a group of laboratories, the hierarchy being formed according to the associated disciplines. ARC grew to laboratory size and status, but it became something of a problem for SRI. Other laboratories (at least in science and engineering) operated more or less as a \"farmers' market,\" where small and changing clusters of researchers promoted and conducted research projects as a loose federation. The management structure, budgeting, accounting, and financing for the Institute had evolved to support this kind of business. </div><br><div>But ARC was driven by a coherent, long-term pursuit. This involved the continuing evolution of an ever larger and more sophisticated system of hardware and software. It also came to involve delivering solid support service to outside clients to provide meaningful environments for learning about the all-important process of coevolution between the human system and tool system components of our organizations (as per my conceptual framework). It didn't seem unreasonable to me to pursue this course; things similar and on a grander scale are common for other researchers. It is taken for granted, for example, that funding agencies will build and operate accelerators and observatories in support of research in nuclear physics and astronomy, or will outfit ships and airplanes to support research expeditions. But whatever my perception, there were some significant problems and stresses with which our overall environment didn't have effective ways to cope. In the particular dynamics involved, there were probably seven relevant parties: me, the ARC staff, other SRI researchers, SRI management and administration, ARC's sponsors, ARC's utility service clients, and other groups of researchers outside of SRI. It would be an interesting historical study to try to understand the diversity of perception that must have existed among this set of players. </div><br><div>What did the different parties perceive for the future of workstations, for the range of function and application that would come about, for the systems architectures and standards that must emerge, and for the impact on the organizations that learned how to harness these most successfully? Even as a central party in what happened, l've not understood the dynamics. But I am pretty sure that disparities among the perceptions of all of the above parties had a major part in what to me was the \"great collapse of SRI ARC.\" Even if I had done everything right over the years (a laughable hypothesis), it is now fairly clear to me that it isn't the market's fault if someone fails in trying to sell it something that the market isn't ready for. In other words, I can't blame those other groups. (Which of course makes for a personal problem, since during those times of black discouragement when one wants desperately to blame someone, there is only one candidate that guy at the head of the list.) In 1977, SRI judged it better to move our large system development and external service activities out from the research institute environment and into a suitable commercial environment. They advertised, entertained prospective bidders, made a selection, and negotiated a transfer of the business to Tymshare, Inc., of Cupertino, California. The system was renamed AUGMENT and marketed as part of Tymshare's integrated Office Automation services. In 1984, McDonnell Douglas Corporation acquired Tymshare, and the small AUGMENT business is now operated as the Augmentation Systems Division of the Computer Systems Company within the MDC Information Systems Group.</div><br><div>Let's take a look at some of the actual experiments we tried during the years from 1964 to 1968 at SRI. Around 1964 we got off the CDC 160A system, which in fact we were using as a personal system. This was our first, real, stand-alone machine.</div><br><div>Screen Selection Tests and the Mouse In those days the cost of getting display systems to work was very high. My strategic plan under the above-mentioned framework was to skip the then prevalent, interactive typewriters and focus from the outset on displays. My assumption was that there is a great deal to learn about how to harness highly interactive display capability, and by the time we really learned how, the prices would be down considerably. We wanted to start early experimenting with screen selection. The idea of working and interacting very actively with the display meant that we had to tell the computer what we were looking at, so we needed a screen selection device. There was a lot of argument about light pens and tracking balls in those days, but none of those arguments served our needs very directly. I wanted to find the best thing that would serve us in the context in which we wanted to work text and structured items and interactive commands. The context was important. So we set up computer-controlled experiments oriented to our working mode, where we assumed that purposeful knowledge workers would be spending a significant portion of their time writing, studying, analyzing, and even debugging. </div><br><div>We collected a set of candidate screen selection devices to test. We did our experiments with our one workstation of that period, which is shown in Fig. 1, together with one of our test devices. In trying to be complete about the array of test devices, I dug up some old notes of mine de scribing a possibility that eventually turned into the very first mouse (Fig. 2). The tests were carefully run, and we even integrated selection errors and their correction penalties in evaluating the \"goodness\" of a de vice. The experiments and their results were fully reported, 5 and later described in a paper 6. The graph in Fig. 3 is representative of our results. The mouse consistently beat out the other devices for fast, accurate screen selection in our working context. For some months we left the other devices attached to the workstation so that a user could use the device of his choice, but when it became clear that everyone chose to use the mouse, we abandoned the other devices.</div><br><div>No one is quite sure why it got named a \"mouse,\" or who first started using that name. None of us would have thought that the name would have stayed with it out into the world, but the thing that none of us would have believed either was how long it would take for it to find its way out there. We also experimented with a way to move your knee up and down or swing it sideways to move the cursor, so you could keep your hands on the keyboard (Fig. 4). 1 also built something that allowed one to control the cursor movement by rotating your head for sideways cursor control, or nodding your head up or down for vertical cursor control. This \"nose-pointing control\" of the cursor left both hands free to operate the keyboard. In each case, some muscles would cramp up. Really, in almost any of these cases, you can get used to things like that. I'm sure there are a lot of things to explore in the future about what is going to work best for interfacing, so that you can tell the computer to which objects on the screen you want to direct its attention. However, we had many things to do, so it was a diminishing return for us to pursue these alternative devices we stayed with the mouse. I have always assumed, though, that something better than the mouse is likely to emerge once the user market becomes more adventurous in exploring the means to higher performance.</div><br><div>The first time-sharing system we got was an SDS940. We considered a number of alternative ways to provide ourselves with a flexible, responsive display system, and finally designed our own. The computer and display drivers timeshared their attention among multiple, 5-inch CRTs, which happened to be the most economical size for a given percentage of screen resolution. In front of each CRT we added a commercial, high quality video camera, mounted with a light shroud over the camera lens and CRT screen (Fig. 5). The resulting video signal, amplified and piped out to our laboratory, drove the video monitors that were our workstation displays. Two display generators, each driving up to eight CRTs, implemented with vacuum tube technology were both bulky (Fig. 6) and very costly. It took one and a half people to keep those things running all of the time. The stroke-generated characters and vector graphics allowed us to have flexible, mixed text and graphic document presentations. The display generators were driven from a direct memory access channel that provided very fast (i.e., one refresh cycle time) creation of a new display image. Figure 7 is a picture of one of our workstations the TV monitor, with a little wooden table we made and a keyboard and a mouse and a keyset. </div><br><div>We explicitly designed for a detached keyboard. My workstation design philosophy was to fix it so what you are looking at is positioned for best viewing, and the devices you use to control the computer should be located where it is best for you to operate them. Don't get caught in the anachronism that because we got used to paper and pencil and that technology, we ought to be able to have our controls right on the surface of the thing that we're working on. It may end up that way is best, but don't make an a priori assumption. So we didn't. One way of explaining to somebody why it could make a significant difference if you can do things faster, is to provide a counter example. So, I had them write with a brick taped to their pencil (Fig. 8), because it's only a matter of happenstance that the scale of our body and our tools and such lets us write as fast as we can. What if it were slow and tedious to write? A person doesn't have to work that way very long before starting to realize that our academic work, our books a great deal would change in our world if that's how hard it had been to write. What if you speed it up? The keyset shown in Fig. 9, in combination with the mouse, provides a two-handed, higher speed option. When you strike a chord, the computer interprets it as a character not really distinguishing between characters generated by keyset or keyboard. Our chord character code (a binary counting scheme mapped to the alphabet) is not really very difficult, my six year old kids took less than a week to learn it. At SRI, we had a project in the early 1960s to experiment with computer-aided, psychomotor skill training, and we used this keyset skill for the very first thing to be learned. The experiment blew up because everybody learned it so fast we couldn't differentiate between those who did and those who didn't have special computer aids. Figure 10 is sort of the picture that I think about when I'm told that we've got to make it easy to learn. Tricycles are \"easy to learn and natural to use\" no hard balancing problems. </div><br><div>How much is it worth to you to extend your mobility? A few hours of learning to balance on two wheels? By 19681 had a workstation like the one in Fig. 11 in my office, and I just started \"living\" on it. In our lab we had six to ten more, timeshared among our group. The whole feeling was great. It was a very, very interesting sort of activity in those days. Who says we didn't do workstation research? This one, our \"Yoga Workstation\" (Fig. 12 with Bill Duval), got to be one of the favorites for some reason. This is what you saw all the time people sitting there in their two-handed working mode, occasionally switching to type on a keyboard. Figure 13 shows Bill English with a workstation made for us by the Herman Miller office furniture company, who were trying to experiment with us. This little console swiveled on one of the chairs and went where you went; you could lean back and work with it very nicely. I wanted to show this workstation and Bill English, who de serves an immense amount of credit for getting things to work. I waved my hands and pointed, and somehow didn't make much progress. But Bill really made things work in those days, so I owe him a lot.</div><br><div>By 1968 we had a marvelous system. We called it \"NLS\" (later \"AUGMENT\"). \"NLS\" stood for \"online system,\" in contrast to \"offline system,\" which we dubbed \"FLS\" just to have different acronyms. A few people would come and visit us, but we didn't seem to be getting the type of general interest that I expected. I was looking for a better way to show people, so we took an immense risk and applied for a special session at the ACMIIEEE CS Fall Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco in December 1968. We set up to give an online presentation using a video projector pointing at a 20-foot screen. Brooks Hall is a large auditorium, and that video projector could put up our display images so you could read them easily from up in the balcony (Fig. 14). The video projector we rented (built by a Swiss company, Eidophor) used a high-intensity projection lamp whose light was modulated by a thin film of oil, which in turn was modulated by the video signal. On the right side of the stage, I sat at our Herman Miller console. We set up a folding screen as a back drop behind me. I saw the same image on my workstation screen there as was projected for the audience to see. We built special electronics that picked up the control inputs from my mouse, keyset, and keyboard and piped them down to SRI over a telephone hookup. We leased two microwave lines up from our laboratory in SRI, roughly 30 miles. It took two additional antennas on the roof at SRI, four more on a truck up on Skyline Boulevard, and two on the roof of the conference center. It cost money running that video projector, and getting people to help us do all of that, cost money; making the special l/O cost money; and leveraging special remote presentation technology on top of our advanced, developmental laboratory technology created extra risk and I was using research money. The nice people at ARPA and NASA, who were funding us, effectively had to say, \"Don't tell me!\" because if this had flopped, we would have gotten in trouble. </div><br><div>But anyway, it worked, and the main reason was because of Bill English's genius for making things work. Back in our lab, we dismantled a number of the display units in our display system, so that we could use the cameras in San Francisco and SRI. We borrowed a few tripods and got some extra people to be camera people. One of our friends, Stuart Brand, who was at that time working on his first Whole Earth Catalog, helped as well. So it was really a group project; there were about 17 of us. On my console on the stage, there was a camera mounted that caught my face. Another camera, mounted overhead, looked down on the workstation controls. In the back of the room, Bill English controlled use of these two video signals as well as the two video signals coming up from SRI that could bring either camera or computer video. Bill could select any of these four video images with optional mixing and frame splitting. We had an intercom that allowed him to direct the action of the people in our lab at SRI who were generating computer images or handling the cameras sending the video up from SRI. </div><br><div>We didn't use any specially made system capabilities; we were just using NLS the way it worked at that time. It had mixed text and graphics, so we could use those to display and represent things. We had the agenda in NLS, and we could run different parts and show diagrams; we could do things as examples. So it was a mix of things of: here's the script and stuff to tell you about, and here's the way it runs; we could also bring other display screens or faces, from our SRI lab, in and out on the screen. At that time we firmly imagined that this was the way future conferences would be run. We could do screen splitting. Figure 15 shows the agenda list with a little marker to show that I'm between two particular items. In Fig. 16, I make a temporary (shopping) list. This was the beginning of our demonstrating ways of structuring ideas. The NLS system supported the user in getting the list organized into categories. We wanted to show how the mouse works. The projected video showed Don Andrews controlling a cursor from our SRI laboratory by moving his mouse around. The superimposed video image of the display screen showed that the cursor would follow it exactly to show how the wheels worked. </div><br><div>Remember, this was 1968 the first public appearance of a mouse. I could also show how the simultaneous use of mouse and keyset worked in such a way that the audience could watch my hands in the lower window and see the computer action in the upper window. Then we brought in Jeff Rulifson to tell about how the software works (Fig. 17). At the same time, his face could be brought in and out behind the display image that he was working with, demonstrating NLS's power for working with very explicitly structured software. He showed graphical diagrams that were embedded in the source code documentation. During Jeff's presentation, Bill English brought the picture from a laboratory camera that caught the view (Fig. 18) of Jeff's keyset operation as he was manipulating his demonstration images unconscious and unhurried a nice way to show the fluid speed offered by combined mouse and keyset use. Toward the end, we also showed that we could cut a \"hole\" in the screen and see Bill Paxton's face from SRI (Fig. 19). For the computer display part of the screen, we could switch back and forth between his work and mine; and we could also switch which of us was controlling all of this. The associated FJCC publication about NLS and other relevant references are listed at the end of this paper.</div><br><div>You can't imagine the relief when it worked. It went on for 90 minutes, and afterward we thought for sure that the world would be talking about everybody starting to augment now. Well, it didn't happen, but we went ahead anyway. I want to discuss a few of the things we did physically to the system after that, and then go into some of the conceptual framework.</div><br><div>We began design of windowing capability for NLS.</div><br><div>We developed concept of a user \"reaching through\" his personal work place (i.e., his familiar online working files and application programs) to access less basic, specialized data and application processes (and other people); that is, the \"reach through\" should provide access to these, translated by the integrated support system, so as to appear as coherent parts of his familiar, personal work place.</div><br><div>We specified our first mail and \"Journal\" system as part of an explicit pursuit of a \"Dialog Support System,\" planning for it to be part of our ARPANET NIC service.</div><br><div>We developed document outputting capability processing our composite, text graphic document files to drive a service bureau, CRT based, full page, Stromberg Carlson photo printer to produce documentation with graphics and text mixed on the same pages.</div><br><div>We became the second host on the ARPANET with our SDS 940. (UCLA was first, UCSB next, then the University of Utah, then ...)</div><br><div>Detailed use of NLS began for internal management processes of ARC: cost records, working forecasts, purchase requisitions, and so on. </div><br><div>We began using the ARPANET to facilitate our reprogramming of NLS for the forthcoming PDP 10 TENEX. The University of Utah had a TENEX on the network, and we used NLS on the 940 to write our new PDP 10 code; using our tree meta compiler, we developed a cross compiler for our 940 that produced PDP 10 relocatable binary code. We would ship that over the net for loading and debugging on Utah's TENEX. When the two computers and the intervening network link were all working properly (lots of \"flat tires\" as in the early days of automobiles), our programmers would do all of this back and forth transitioning \"through\" the same workstation. I think that it was not only a record making way of working, but the NLS transport task was accomplished in remarkably short time (we attributed part of the efficiency to the network, and part to the use of NLS).</div><br><div>We brought NLS up on the PDP 10 TENEX with improved and new features (including multiple windows). The transfer process, and a detailed description of the design changes and new features for NLS are described in a June 1971 technical report 9.</div><br><div>We began using our Mail/Journal system within our group. Integrated into NLS, this assumed that a mail item was a document so any part of all of an NLS document could be sent and provided for a permanent record in explicitly retrievable form (our Journal). As an electronic mail system, this was quite advanced. It had a directory service (our Ident System) to provide mail relevant information about registered users; mail distribution was addressed by people's Idents, with no need to know or specify which host they used. Fields were provided for superseding other items, and for attaching keywords. An online index was provided for stored items.10</div><br><div>We began developing our first, integrated Help system.</div><br><div>We formulated the \"AKW Architecture,\" implemented in stages. \"</div><br><div>We implemented the \"shared screen,\" televiewing mode of online collaboration between two or more NLS users.</div><br><div>We brought up a table subsystem in NLS.</div><br><div>We designed our first, totally modular user interface system, as later described in the OAC '82 Digest, 13 and got it running on a PDP 11 that talked to our TENEX through the network, via our procedure call protocol.</div><br><div>We developed our line processor, as described by Don Andrews. It incorporated Intel's first microprocessor (the 4004) in a special box that was inserted in the communication line between a dumb display terminal and a modem. This made use of our virtual terminal protocols, and managed a multi window, two dimensional screen using off the shelf, \"dumb\" display terminals. Our mouse and keyset input devices were plugged into the line processor, which appropriately translated their actions to control cursor position and special communications to the host. A printer port on the line processor provided local printout service; a special communication protocol allowed the host to send printer packets mixed in with display support packets.</div><br><div>We finalized specification for our network virtual terminal, something that has become a key part of our architecture. The objective, on the one hand, was to free the application programmers from worrying about the special features of different workstations, and on the other hand, to enable more flexible evolution by users of workstations they may adopt to fit particular needs. As part of this, there was a terminal independent display manipulation protocol for communication from application program to terminal, and an application independent input protocol for communicating from terminal to application program.</div><br><div>We generalized the file structure of our document files to provide for generalized property structures associated with each addressable object, intended to accommodate composite integration of such as graphics, digitized speech, scan  coded images, or any other arbitrary data form.</div><br><div>We gave up our high performance, local display system for the line processor supported, remote display system to make ourselves live with the same remote services as our NIC clients and Utility customers. (On principle, we gave up our integrated, direct view graphics and the fast response of our direct memory access, local display generator.)</div><br><div>We opened our \"Workshop Utility Service.\" Delivering NLS service over the ARPANET to DOD customers as pilot applications of office information service. We had gone out on bid for commercial time sharing services, selected Tymshare Inc. of Cupertino, Calif.; their host, named Office 1, provided the computer service. We fielded special trainers and application development staffs and cultivated special customer representatives into a spirited community.</div><br><div>We implemented our new, integrated graphics system, which could support remote display and manipulation of illustrative graphics on a Tektronix 4014 storage tube display plugged into the line processor's printer port. Figure 20 shows the graphic station setup used for development in our lab. Bob Belleville, to the right in the picture, developed this \"new\" graphics software. (He subsequently went to Xerox and helped them with the Star hardware, and then was the project manager for the Apple Macintosh.)</div><br><div>In 1973 we had generalized our file structure with provision for attribute value property structures associated with each hierarchic node. We could then embed arbitrary data objects in our documents. The first utilization w as to reinstate embedded graphics, extending our hierarchical list structure and its pointers to the text objects with, for example, an associated pointer on one of the text objects to a graphic substructure for the associated illustration. The user's concept would be shown in an associated \"document page\" image. We assumed that soon we would be using digitized speech strings and executable object code as part of our composite documents. And some day, when storage would be cheaper, we would even be embedding scanned images. An illustration produced as a plotter driver file by any other graphics system could be picked up and attached to a specified location in an NLS document, and could be subsequently viewed and modified with the NLS Graphics Subsystem. Figure 21 shows two such \"ingested\" illustrations, as viewed in two adjacent NLS graphic windows. Our use was oriented toward \"illustrative graphics,\" and we had a reasonably complete set of capabilities for construction and manipulation. </div><br><div>By this time, we had a well-developed Output Processor (our \"document compiler\"), which acted upon a large vocabulary of embedded text directives to provide font selection, columniation, running headers and footers, and much more.16 In conjunction with the Graphics Subsystem, the Output Processor was enhanced so that a user could direct that a properly scaled image of any graphic illustration be located appropriately within a multifont page layout. All this was available by 1975 1976. But the problem at the time was that for somebody to use this, they would have to buy a $10,000 or $15,000 storage tube terminal to go with the line processor and text terminal. We couldn't get past this business of \"if they don't have it, they don't know they need it; and if they don't know they need it, they don't want to buy it.\" </div><br><div>It was a little difficult at the time, so the graphics sort of atrophied until recently. The whole approach was that our files were document oriented documents in a very general sense. These are what contain the descriptions, arguments, proposals, whatever, the things you're trying to map your thoughts and arguments into to form a communication. Another thing we did, though, in 1967, was to help people collaborate in face to face meetings. Here again, Bill English whipped it all together very fast special small narrow tables that you could work around and sit at in a conference meeting, where the monitors were down low enough so you could see over them and see each other well. Each monitor had the same image that was brought from our one user 3100 at the time, but we had one workstation and some mice. Anybody who wanted to pick up a mouse and push the button could, and this would activate a large, special cursor that could be controlled and moved around, so any participant could point out things on the common display. </div><br><div>We had a review meeting among our sponsors at the time. The picture (Fig. 22) shows Bill English, Don Andrews, Dave Hopper, and Barry Wesler, who was Bob Taylor's assistant. Bob was in attendance at the time, too, participating in this conference. Another thing we did by 1970 was to bring up our electronic mail system as part of our collaboration. There was really a very sophisticated mail system with user identification, catalogs, and all sorts of fields that you could use to send and answer thing s. One extra feature was that you could send whole documents; it didn't matter whether it was a little one sentence note or a whole document. A document could go in and be catalogued into a system called the \"Journal,\" which was similar to the idea of pasting it down on a table (Fig. 23). We had linkages and internal addressability, so an embedded link in one document could directly cite an arbitrary passage in any other. Successive documents could be entered in the system and easily be cross referenced back to each other. This supported what we called our \"recorded dialog\" an important part that we assumed was needed for a community of people to work together effectively. It is an extremely powerful capability. </div><br><div>We originally designed our Mail/Journal system to give the user a choice as to whether to make an entry unrecorded (as in current mail systems), or to be recorded in the Journal. I knew that there would be lots of question, and some quandary, associated with the question \"to record or not to record.\" I assumed that many fewer items would be recorded than \"should be\" as might be judged after we someday would learn the value and establish criteria for recording. So, I ordained that all entries would be recorded no option. It put some people under considerable strain. I think that one person actually never could bring himself to enter a memo into the Journal the idea that it was \"forever\" stopped him cold. Another person, a very valuable contributor, somehow felt violently opposed to the basic concept, and it possibly hastened his departure. But after a year or so, it was used as a matter of course by essentially everyone. There were interesting and unexpected payoffs. Up until about 1975, we made a practice of printing out every one of the stored documents mostly as an alternate analytic process to watch the dynamics of Journal use. The documents are stored by number, in binders as shown in Fig. 24. This indicates how big our Journal collection got in about four or five years. The number now for that particular journal is well over 100,000 items. We have an arbitrary number of other journal systems that customer groups can install and administer themselves, a very powerful potential archive for collaborative work.</div><br><div>Let's now shift back to the conceptual framework, originally documented in a 1962 paper.'7 I had this immensely intuitive feeling that humans were going to be able to derive a great deal of capability from computer systems. I had very real images in my mind of sitting at a display console, interacting with a computer, seeing all sorts of strange symbology coming up that we could invent and develop to facilitate our thinking. We would no longer be limited to working with paper and other such laborious means. Other people could be sitting at similar consoles tied to their machine and we could be collaborating in brand new, exciting ways. We could be doing all sorts of things to control a computer. At that time, even though I didn't know how the innards of a computer worked, I had enough engineering background to know that if a computer could read a card, it could sense keys and any other action I might want to do. If it could drive a printer or card punch, it could put whatever I wanted onto a display. What I didn't understand at the time was the economics and all that, but I said, \"Look, I've got a whole career ahead of me, let's go after all of this.\" By 1959 or so, I got a chance to sit down and say, \"How would that really work? What are the basics?\" As an engineer, I ended up with a simplifying model (Fig. 25). </div><br><div>Here's a human wanting to do this knowledge work; he's got capabilities within his skin that we can make use of, a lot of mental capabilities we know of, and some of it he's even conscious of. Those are marvelous machines there motor machinery to actuate things in the outside world, and sensor and perceptual machinery to get the idea of what's going on. And that's what he has to support his interaction with the outside world. How can we improve the human's capability (Fig. 26)? Well, it turns out that there have been a lot of people working on this problem for many generations. And we've got a whole \"culture full\" of things that we are indoctrinated and trained into, both conscious things and unconscious things. We have lots of skills, motor wise and perception wise, that we're not even aware of. For example, just how long do you think it took to learn to brush your teeth? It takes quite a while; it's a skill. These sensory motor things all developed in order to help us interact with the layers of other things that our culture provides. Many such things are available to us, tools and methods that let us live within a social structure and be effective in our interactions. And there's a whole subset of tools and methods that help us be effective in dealing with knowledge work. So take all those things together and call them an \"augmentation system\" (Fig. 27). That's what augments humans. </div><br><div>And for good, practical purposes, let's divide the system into two parts. One part has all the technology in it and the other has all the rest. So I called these the \"tool system\" and \"human system.\" The human system includes training, knowledge, and skills that have to be installed as well as language, an extremely important invention that transcends, as an invention, anything else we have come up with. The methods, and all that we use to knit together all the little steps that we take during a day, are extremely important. Our customs for working, our procedures, the way our organizations are run, they're all done so that humans can realize effective results. Within this framework, any given capability that a human has is really a composite. The human capability is made up of the use of a lot of things and skills and training and conditioning, in addition to all the customs we just accept and the language that we've learned. It's this composite that we need to find ways to accentuate. So along comes a lot of new technology for our tool system, which is great. But the technology side, by itself, is not sufficient. Our real capabilities are essentially hierarchical (Fig. 28). We learn a lot of lower order capabilities, like writing and typing and reading. And we have built up many higher capabilities on top of these. So, if we bring in some new technology, like a longer lasting pen, it's going to make a little bit of effect. But if we bring in the kind of digital technology that was predictable, even in 1960, then potential changes throughout the whole system, affecting significantly the entire capability hierarchy, can begin to take place.</div><br><div>It takes a long time (generations) to discover and implement all of the fruitful changes in the human system made possible by a given, radical improvement in technology. Where, as is the situation now, technology improves by rapid, large steps, it is predictable that the human system will become critically stressed in trying to adapt rapidly in ways that formerly took hundreds of years. There has to be a much enhanced consciousness about concurrent evolution in the human system. The technology side, the tool system, has inappropriately been driving the w hole. What has to be established is a balanced coevolution between both parts. How do we establish an environment that yields this coevolution? Well, that's where the bootstrapping in a laboratory comes in. I said I wanted to do what I knew it was going to be like in our future. So we had to be more conscious of the candidates for change in both the tool and the human systems. Whenever you hear somebody say it has to be \"easy to learn and natural to use,\" put up a little flag and go question it. What's \"natural\"? Is there a natural way to guide a vehicle, as will reins? Well, that lasted a long time. No! What's natural is what we have grown to accept. </div><br><div>And if we look at how much learning it took to drive automobiles, and own and operate them, it would make ridiculous the things people save now regarding what they expect their computer system's learning to cost them. If it's going to be the kind of working companion that it's bound to be, then the learning part of it is relatively trivial. I know it's what sells now, because the market isn't very mature for people to buy things that look like they're going to be hard to learn. But I'm talking about the long term trends, and the responsibilities of people that are doing the research and downstream planning. l think they should start looking much more seriously for really significant gains in human performance and consider many more candidates for change, with special attention to the much neglected human system candidates. This will bring up lots of things that might not have been even thought of before, because now there is explicit, active \"prospecting\" for ways to do things differently. The mouse and the keyset came from trying to do something new in the tool system (similarly for structured files and their viewing and linking). I didn't realize at the time how strange they'd seem and how long it would take for people to start considering them. So then, how does the change take place? In a large organization (Fig. 29) there are lots of different parties taking part in a change. An idea for change in one place often \"needs\" help from another before the original idea can be implemented for example, one might ask if the mail room could make one more daily delivery. Then, when such a need is fulfilled by a change in capability of one of the \"lower\" parts, it provides new \"possibilities\" for change among the \"higher\" parts that depend upon it. </div><br><div>Evolution proceeds by reverberation: needs propagate downward, and when fulfilled, a new possibility propagates upward. Correspondingly, a possibility propagated by a new capability in a lower level place can trigger a new idea in a higher place. Continuing the example, we can improve our operation by taking advantage of the extra mail delivery, but we'd need the copy center to change. . . . Possibilities tend to stimulate new needs. So when we've got a fairly large organization, or large system of things, with specialists working all over the place that are responsible for changes in certain areas, there will have to be some extraordinary communicating to provide decade frame evolution on a scale previously requiring centuries. Changes once took place so slowly that we weren't really aware of the evolutionary process. People moved and finally heard about something and tried it. But now, with a catapulting rate of change, and the pressures to become more effective, the changes within our organizations are just going to exceed the rate that we know how to deal with. Unless people start getting conscious and understanding about the evolution, for many, many structures this fast changing rate is going to exceed the elastic limit, and things are going to break. So I said, \"What better place could you start putting to work the new tools and things than in the process that is going to facilitate the evolution you have to go through.\" That produced a strong push toward computerized documents, and toward collaboration among groups. </div><br><div>One way to look at how to use the computer to help work with documents would be the possibility of a conventional word processor approach. It's a very straightforward way. The orientation is to simulate paper on a display, targeted solely to produce hard copy. A considerable advantage in many situations, but it is a very anemic example of what the above framework promises. It didn't even enter my mind to go with that picture. Instead, what my framework produced is shown in Fig. 30. The motor capability of the abstracted human module drives the computer tools and employs the associated methodological and conceptual linguistic parts of his augmentation system in the special modes indicated. The result is quite a bit different from \"word processing\" and \"office automation.\"</div><br><div>For instance, we should have an open ended command vocabulary. Once we get hooked up to running in a more flexible environment, the computer tools must provide us with more and more functionality. Since we've got a very powerful beast that can do things, let's really look for fast control means where, for instance, we aren't limited to doing things sequentially, but can do things with both hands, concurrently. This stimulated the chord keyset option. I thought we should make it so that both content and structure can be stored and explicitly manipulated. Bring text and graphics together, because they're both important. Every object in a file should be addressable, because I wanted to do remote jumping and manipulation. So we developed a very flexible addressing scheme that seems to fit well with a user's mental map of his working domain and offers handy addressing options that, in any command, can optionally be used in place of cursor selection. One should be able to move around in existing files rapidly and precisely, and easily jump across any intervening \"file or content space\" to an explicitly prescribed position. The computer should help navigate throughout the entire working space. When I am positioned at a desired file object, I want to generate a view that will best serve my purpose of the moment. </div><br><div>So, we evolved a flexible set of \"view specifications\" that can be invoked at any time and an explicit opportunity is offered the user at any \"jump\" operation to designate \"ViewSpecs.\" For example, \"in this window, show only the first line of each statement, no blank lines between statements, show location addresses (e.g., \"3b4\") in front of each statement, show only the statements hierarchically \"under\" the targeted statement, and only those that are in the first two sub levels.\" A con tent filter, of any degree of sophistication, can be invoked within any such ViewSpec so that, among the candidate statements already specified, only those that have a given content will be show. Simple filters (e.g., to find a given embedded string) can be keyed in at any time and compiled on the fly. More sophisticated filter patterns can be stored as text strings that a user can specify with a \"Set Content Pattern\" command. Or, a programmer can write and compile very sophisticated filters that a user can easily designate by name to be instituted. </div><br><div>With a comprehensive addressing scheme it is easy to implement citation links, special text strings that both user and computer can interpret as addressing some object and also optionally specifying a particular view to be employed. \"Jumping on a link\" is a basic command, taking the user directly to the target object. A link can also be employed as part of the addressing in any other command u here some file object is to be specified. If I am moving around in somebody else's stuff, so I can study and analyze it much more effectively, I want to be able to train the displays myself, because a display may not look as I expect it to look when I'm looking at it straight down on paper, and indeed it doesn't. And do I want it also so that I can share that display with others, so that we can collaborate? And share files? So that's the image, and that's why NLS was designed as it was.</div><br><div>Now to discuss architecture. I'll use a series of simple illustrations to lead up to the general approach we settled upon. Consider, as in Fig. 31, an application program on top of an operating system in a computer, serving a terminal. For any such application program, there are two facets: an interface process and the actual process that does the substantive work two different parts. Let's think about them as two distinct but related design issues. For instance, I don't want the smart programmer who knows all about how this program works internally to think that he's the one to tell the world how to interface with it. By 1968 we had begun evolving the programming language so that it was different for each part, and we could actually think and design for two separate modules (Fig. 32). The next step was to ask, Why, for each different application package, should you have a different front end? Frontends should be universal things, as in Fig. 33, to serve multiple (or all) applications for the user. So our language ideas were evolving to handle this approach. The system that we brought up on the SDS940 in 1968 was organized along these lines, as shown in Fig. 34. All the subroutines that did the application work were written with our special, MOL940 language that we had to develop ourselves. </div><br><div>The control processes were specified in a control metalanguage, then com piled with a control metalanguage translator into the control processor, which interacted with the user. We had a tree meta translator that let us do our compiler compiling. We described a new compiler in a metacompiler language, then compiled it with the tree meta translator into the new, running compiler. Incidentally, in those days I would talk about control language and control metalanguage rather than the command language because I felt that we were doing a lot of things that normally people don't think of as commands. But the pressure of external world usage pulled us around so now we call it command language. It was really fortunate for us to be involved in the ARPANET from the beginning. My early ideas of \"community\" support services could be made explicit in planning for the Network Information Center. One of the papers I wrote pointed out that besides allowing us to share data and process resources, the emergent networks will also provide us with a knowledge marketplace that's wide open for people sitting at their terminals all over the world. Topologically, Fig. 35 depicts what we assumed by the early 1970s would be the future environment for knowledge workers.</div><br><div>Let's not argue about how much functionality is in any one place. To the user, it doesn't matter whether the workstations are smart or not, as long as they do what he wants them to do. So let's look at topology. The topology that we wanted (Fig. 36), involved a user interface system (UIS) that's between the user's physical interface hardware (display, keyboard, mouse) and all the \"smart\" application software. I don't care how much of these smarts are in his local workstation, but I'm never going to say that it all has to be there. Between the user interface system and all of the application systems is a \"virtual bus\" some UIS communication will be to applications in the local workstation, some to applications on the local  area network, and some may be far out through gateways to the UIS of a colleague. An important part of what we wanted to provide was a set of functions that the user thinks of as his private or \"local\" (topologically) workplace where he does his composing, studying, mail management, and calculations. But also he should be able to \"reach through\" his local workplace to get at all the other services. </div><br><div>The internal architecture of the UIS (Fig. 37) contains a virtual terminal controller (VTC) so all of the applications are programmed to deal with a standard, virtual terminal. The VTC translates to and from particular physical terminal l/O streams, enabling different classes of terminal equipment for different classes of users and also, importantly, makes evolution within the whole system easier. The command language interpreter (CLI) interprets the user actions according to the command language specification coded into the currently attached grammar file, which was created from a command metalanguage description via the command metalanguage compiler. The CLI also deals with a user specific, user profile file that enables individuals and classes of users to have independent control options. The procedure call interface (PCI) modules translate back and forth between the procedure call conventions of the various larger modules and the remote procedure call protocol we developed for use between arbitrary modules (including those connected via byte sequential network circuits). </div><br><div>We called this architectural configuration \"The Augmented Knowledge Workshop,\" and figured that all knowledge workers in the future would work in some such environment. The early framework concepts led us to believe that open ended functionality was inevitable. Also, it emphasized how essential it was to facilitate the coevolution of the human and tool systems. One important objective in this architectural approach was to support this coevolution: Hardware and software could be changed with minimum disturbance to the human system and, conversely, changes in terminology, methodology, and functional dependence upon the tools could evolve with minimum disturbance to the tool system. One way to illustrate payoff from this architecture is to consider the different profiles of functionality that different classes of users would likely want to employ as they look through their respective classes of terminals into their \"knowledge workshops.\" A high level project manager, a support clerk, or a skilled, heavy working professional can each work with grammar and user profile files that provide the functionality he or she needs, with command terminology and interaction modes suited to skill levels and ways of thinking. All of this architecture was working by 1976, although it has only been recently that we could interest user organizations in trying to harness it toward an integrated knowledge work environment. A number of our publications explicate various aspects of this architecture.19</div><br><div>It is important that the evolution of the user side should go on maximally; it has been badly neglected. The \"basic human unit\" is shown in Fig. 38. How are we going to evolve it? The reverberation concept of its evolution is very important in my framework, and I have come to believe that it is only done by what you'd call \"communities.\" Even in a large, highly structured organization much of the change process must involve stakeholders in groupings that are different from the line management structure (i.e., like a community). This is a big, important concept that started in the mid-1960s. If we depend critically upon a community that must interact in really effective collaboration, we need to build support systems especially designed for this purpose. Part of the conscious evolutionary process for our large organizations and institutions must therefore be to provide effective collaboration support for widely dispersed communities (Fig. 39). </div><br><div>But how was I going to promote an R&D program, with a \"pilot community,\" to learn how to develop and provide effective \"community support\" tools and associated new collaborative methods? Well, in the spring of 1967, at an ARPA principal investigators meeting, Bob Taylor and Larry Roberts told us that ARPA was going to make computer network R&D a major program thrust, and that our \"research computers\" were going to be the ones connected by an experimental \"ARPA Network.\" Even though many others were disturbed by the idea (because of perceived interference with their major research thrusts), I was thrilled. Finally, after listening to the initial interactions, I volunteered to develop and operate what became the ARPANET Network Information Center (NIC). What I wanted was for the NIC to become a community support center that would really go after the development of collaboration support tools and methods, and would provide services to encourage the ARPANET R&D folks to evolve their working ways accordingly. </div><br><div>Hopefully, there would emerge a sub community out there composed of those interested in the various aspects of augmenting (Fig. 40).Just consider the kind of leverage you get this way. So I've talked about a \"bootstrap community\" in my notes for over 15 years now, and it's something I still very much would like to see established (Fig. 41). Many features and capabilities built into NLS/AUGMENT were directly motivated by these community support and distributed collaboration concepts. Unfortunately, the ARPANET grew so fast that the Network Information Center had to trim down what it could do functionally. We couldn't provide the extensive support services we had planned (dis cussed at some length in a 1972 paper20), such as what we could do to support a community by integrating a lot of its dialog, and getting an intelligence system there; handbooks that evolved to integrate what to do; and professional facilitation staff, which adds important value. There is a lot that can be embedded in this. NLS/AUGMENT was built to be able to handle external document (XDOC) control, the community intelligence collection that everyone contributes to and participates in, and indexes to it. </div><br><div>When the community has a special mission or disciplinary interest, we also could significantly facilitate the development and maintenance of a \"dynamic community handbook\" that integrates current status (terminology, hypotheses, conventions, plans, expectations, and so forth) in a coherent, self-consistent fashion. Figure 42 portrays all of this community support in a fashion peculiar to the NLS/AUGMENT set of features and capabilities. While each user had his own collection of working files, there would be a large collection of shared information all of it embedded in uniform, composite document structures. The generalized citation link capability interconnects passages of any of these documents in meaningful ways as evolved with user conventions and collaborative methods. Ordinary, unrecorded mail and shared files gain significant value thereby. The Journal system provides its own unique value, considerably amplified with linkage use. </div><br><div>A \"community intelligence collection\" (CIC) can be distributed over all of the document types embodying useful information and discussion about external activities relevant to the community's interests. Special indexing into this collection is again much enhanced with links. The Community Handbook fits into the picture nicely; any given \"edition\" is \"published\" in the Journal (and is probably available also in corresponding hard copy), which is controlled with the XDOC system. I'm going to terminate at this point, since after 1976 we really had no chance to continue pursuing this \"augmentation framework.\" It seemed no longer to fit in the pattern of the research at ARPA, or with what SRI wanted to do. When we landed out in the commercial world, we found it wasn't what people there wanted to do, either. </div><br><div>The AUGMENT system stayed alive in sort of a funny, dumb way, often like taking a bulldozer in to help people work in their back yards. Then, McDonnell Douglas bought Tymshare, and inside of its aerospace organization it's a very different situation because of the very heavy knowledge work involved. For a year I've been going out and talking with all those people involved in big projects and CAD systems, and finding out that these concepts are directly relevant to the needs and problems now being recognized there. We're starting this year to build special interest communities. The first one is the AI community; possibly followed by the Ada community. Also, explicit consideration of integrated architectures similar to ours is under way, including not only virtual terminals, command interpreters, remote procedure calls, and shared screen support, but also composite documents with addressable objects and citation links. So that's a quick pass over my historical record.</div>",

He's going to be talking about the Augment system which is an extension of the work done at SRI at McDonnell Douglas. Doug? [inaudible 00:00:36]</div><br><div>Doug:\t[inaudible 00:00:44] I'm going to show some slides and then actually try to show you some of the way Augment works, some of the unique innards of it that have been there for years and it's hard to read about, to learn much. I'm trying to show it to you and the arrangement is quite nice except the resolution of the camera coming down on the tubes won't quite let it be readable if it looks at the whole screen so we're going to work at trying to [inaudible 00:01:16] part of the screen so that the part we use, the window we use will be more readable. But when it's doing that I'm going to have to do some very awkward things in order to know where I'm flying. It's going to be a mutual adventure.</div><br><div>\tThere are quite a few different things we invented and built through the years, in the pursuit of it I'll explain a little bit on some of the slides, but heavily document oriented in its application focus and there' a strong reason for that within what I was trying to do to support knowledge workers in a very special way. In the last ten years I've been out in the commercial world and then went, McDonnell Douglas bought Tymshare which had bought my laboratory from SRI in a very unprecedented move. When McDonnell Douglas bought Tymshare and we were way off in some corner, and contrary to the rumor, they didn't buy it because of us.</div><br><div>\tI got a chance to roam through the airspace side and very much interested in their big systems and the problems I assumed they'd be facing and trying to integrate them and introduce the integrated documents and exchange and uniform interfaces through all of that. I met a colleague there, [inaudible 00:02:46] Carter who just happened to be in town or going by, that there's a lot going on in the news in those big organizations in which these things I'll show you are bound to play a role in the future. Some implementation of this sort along with a lot of integrated architecture which you don't get the picture of what's coming when you see all the exciting things happening in the personal computer world. But there's a lot coming. I'll try to give you a glimpse of that.</div><br><div>\t[inaudible 00:03:16] technology here. We'll start with some slides. I'm supposed to get an optical pointer here, which would help. Otherwise I'll walk over here. This a report, published at SRI in 1962, that was after I'd been on this kick for eleven years, believe it or not and gotten a few years to put this together and I said, \"Well, I really feel like interactive computers are going to make a huge, huge difference in the capability of what now you'd call the knowledge worker.\" Then I called it, sort of, augmenting the human intellect and there's a great deal in that framework that still sparks me on and most of the things we did came right out of it. We'll give a little bit of a preliminary description of that, very brief, so that'll orient you why I did it. There was a chapter in a book in 1963 that was included. It created a great wave of enthusiasm out in the world. The one response I got was somebody six months later asking me how you felt this acronym, H dash L-A-M slash P? I used it always, too, to represent my systems and it was stunning when he asked me that because I'd been working by myself all through these years to do this and I never tried to come out with it.</div><br><div>\tHere's a little bit of the graphic. [inaudible 00:04:51] This is a kind of simplified graphic to explain why [inaudible 00:05:02] I said, \"I want to make the capability of humans much more effective and how do I start thinking?\" As an engineer I said, \"Well let's do this.\" This is what you begin with and these are a simplified model of how a human being has to face the world. You've got the model of perceptual machinery, motor machinery, quite a bit of mental machinery. Some of it he's conscious of and a lot he isn't. That's what he's equipped with to face the outside world. You realize that unless you add quite a big more to that, anybody's got that same thing, but what do you have to equip yourself to be capable of coping with the world?</div><br><div>\tAll right. In these general areas you need to provide more things. Generally most of that's provided by your culture as you grow up. You get inculcated with a lot of unconscious sort of attitudes and customs and things, you just assume the way things will get done. You soak up linguistic things in here and conceptual, and lots of explicit, symbolic, and linguistic, and things that are quite constant that you absorb. A lot of unconsciously accepted and perhaps unconsciously pursued skills, perceptual motor, and all of that is generally there so you can handle stuff out here that your culture provides you in order to cope with the world. So you say, \"Yeah.\"</div><br><div>\tThere's a great deal already provided that augments the basic human so he can be capable out in the world. I started saying well let me just this that and pretty soon I'd realized there's been a fabulous amount of invention over all the generations. You're just overwhelmed. You're thinking, oh, you come along some bright-eyed jerk and he says, \"I've got all this computer stuff I think would be applicable\" and you realize there's been so much invention in the future and I almost quite. Then I got to thinking, \"Well, let's get a little more into this\" and you realize you toggle one set of those augmentation systems things that your technology can provide you with tools. These are just sort of representative kinds of things that would list in that. And another set of things that aren't technology. These things the culture provides you and they generally match what you have here in order to give you capability. You have to have skills and knowledge that you're trained in in order to cope with all of these things. It came to be something like this.</div><br><div>\tBy the time a human was capable of something significant it really drew on all kinds of skills and knowledge developed in here that coordinated with what's provided here and here by his culture. That's what makes us capable. Without a system like this we're essentially helpless. You say, all right, technology can come here and do something quite significant and make a difference. Well, people start talking about automation. This is so you were going to use tools over here to automate what you're doing here now. But if your tools are radical enough over there the concept that just swept me off my feet was, wow, there's so much change you can do in here in order better to harness something really significant coming out over here. It's a real advantage in human capability wouldn't come and tell, you really got to balance development over here of the new means of thinking and working and even new linguistics, very deep linguistics sorts of things, concepts and portrayals and even the syntax that you use in your head as you work and think, will change a great deal. So that, to me, was what Augmentation was, and to start pursuing that the strategy, well, start building things here which make a difference and sort of bootstrap your way up. Learn, make the changes here.</div><br><div>\tAt the very outset in '62 when I finally got that put together the idea was, look for the changes here. That's what we've done and there've been aspects about this which grew into serious architectural things, too which I'll deal with very lightly before I go into some of the document sort of things. And that is if you want this to start changing and this to start changing they have to be sort of a coordinated co-evolution. You can't come up with a bunch of vendors and bright-eyed engineers and programmers, if you'll pardon the expression, that are going to produce new things that are going to tweak the world because over here there's a whole bunch of ways of changing that you can change and deal with your work that make a lot of difference in what you want to produce here. They really depend upon each other so it just should co-evolve. How do you get that going? How do you get some of the new dimensions of change over here started? That's what I was looking for, some of the new dimensions.</div><br><div>\tIn the older ones where it had a little bit about linguistic ways, the way, what's the role of a document and what's the opportunity inside a computer to deal with documents? You can say, all right, one and the same, this is very much a model of what kind of currently is the primary thing to do with computers and documents is, you write, manipulate in computer storage and look at it and you've got page, pages and [inaudible 00:10:26] picture of what you see is what you're going to get because the objective is to print something out and deal with it. I just didn't for a minute stop there. This was never even in my picture, or, made it work for ten minutes and so on out. Here's more what the system in the '60s objective was. I'll go through these different things with some slides and demonstrations to kind of make them more real. The idea is that the tools and language and new methods for the human give you these new kinds of things and that you want open-ended vocabulary because the functionality is found and has evolved indefinitely, in my mind. If you've got a strong powerful beast in this computer doing for you what you want to get done you don't want to control it with very old-fashioned techniques like just a keyboard. It'd be like getting in a 300 horsepower high performance car and kicking up the range and saying, \"Get up.\" It just isn't appropriate to keep hanging on there. What you want for a fast kind of control that the people want to get the real power out of that can evolve to.</div><br><div>\tThen you want to do writing and structuring and both content and structure, the idea was to take the conceptual, symbolic structures that are in your mind and over here make a map of them that's the best representation you can that serves your purpose for what you'd like to do and are externally manipulable symbol record of what you're dealing with that represents your thoughts and concepts.</div><br><div>\tRight away you can start thinking about putting structure in there that helps you work with relationships between your concepts. I just really began to say a hierarchy is a pretty good one, maybe I'd rather have reentrant lists and all of that. We'll just start with simple hierarchy. In a couple years when we've learned a lot we'll move on to something else. Lot of evolutionary things didn't work as fast as I had assumed. Then the thing about the objects in your file want to be named and addressed because that gives you a lot more power for moving around in them. All that was built into here and it provides remote jumps and manipulation, it's very flexible and a strong focus on moving the positions in the file that you wanted to and when you get there you have a view generated for you that's what you need at the moment.</div><br><div>\tThe model of that sort of was you conceptually move your head to some topic. You also unconsciously pick a level of conceptualization on that topic. You probably don't go way down at the detail unless there's some very specific little piece of the assembly language code or something you want to deal with. Your mind just goes to a level. Why not give us the same capability in moving around there of having views that suit us at the moment? Which is strongly different from saying, \"I'm going to think of it as pages, and what you see is what you're going to get on paper and that's great.\" No, here it says [inaudible 00:13:28] if you're going to print out, great. Then you'd like to see what you're going to get but while you're composing and studying and modifying and sharing you look at what, make it so that it benefits that and find your display that the human perceptual mechanism watches that and the motor mechanism controls all of these things to fly. That's the model that we built our systems and I'm going to probably demonstrate a bunch of those.</div><br><div>\tFirst some slides to give us some idea about some of these two things. The open-ended vocabulary and the fast, concurrent control. We are very lucky to be part of the planning for the ARPANET from the very first time the idea of ARPANET was broached to the principle investigators of which I was one. In the original ideas we'd have a network, it would link just the, roughly thirteen computer systems, all of which were doing research for ARPA. No thought about linking to other people. In that sense, because it related so much what I wanted to do, I volunteered the day we were told about that to start and learn the network information centers. By the time we got it organized and got going the networks began to work in 1970, they began to add all kinds of other DOD users on there because they wanted the political support to help keep Congress from wiping out that network R and D program. Not realizing yet what a tremendously significant thing that network experiment turned out to be.</div><br><div>\tAnyways, soon there were so many people on that network that the grand and glorious things I was going to do with support for small community just couldn't be supported for all of them. That was too bad. Anyway, one of the things we came out with was this feeling on the future about the architecture's going to look like this and this picture stems from early '70s. [inaudible 00:15:21] had that idea that whatever you had here for a workstation may couple with a network of networks and gateways and that anyone who is at a workstation, it isn't connected, it's like he's got an office without a door. I just could not imagine. What you want is an architecture that assumes you don't have homogeneous software and hardware out there because that's a terrible way, that's a sure way to kill evolution is to try to have a one-ended [inaudible 00:15:53] system, when you're talking about a sizable thing out there.</div><br><div>\tIf you've got application programming and data in your workstation, good. But whether it's out here in a local network or farther out in a private network or out in the public network your interface shouldn't be that worried about it. We actually built an independent user interface system work module that's been in there for twelve years now, that has a virtual terminal controller for the application program to kind of deal with a virtual terminal and there's a lot evolving nowadays that sort of fits that model. The command language interpreter that you can put a grammar attached to very quickly swapped this and it changes the whole nature of whatever interface language you want and it makes calls out to, remote procedure calls out to whatever back end you're working with. Procedure call interface there. User profile that makes the command recognition in whatever special things the user wants come in with that user and the terminal characteristics tell a virtual terminal controller how to deal with that kind of terminal.</div><br><div>\tThe idea is your actual terminal hardware, the keyboard and the things you actuate and see, is what you call a terminal, and if you've got lots of [inaudible 00:17:08] there let's put it out in the other side of what you think is a virtual bus. User interface systems sort of, interface in there and you can couple with things. An important part of what you're going to connect with is what you think of as your own, local work place that's just like your office. You have a place to sit down and you're thinking and working and mail interaction, preparing documents, things of that sort in your local workplace. The other things are sort of outside and the idea of reaching through to those in ways which has a compatible command language with what you're used to, so that's a translator in there for helping you interface with all those to something consistent. Each class of user with its class of terminals can sort of look into that workshop, knowledge workshop area, and extract a profile of functions and have that sort of conceptually oriented command language and command system that you like.</div><br><div>\tWe were building that and in the commercial world we got just into ten years ago, the customers didn't know what they wanted to have in this. They didn't want to pay for it, the people who are supporting us certainly weren't going to pay for it being done. Now in the big, heavy industrial world, just the kind of a thing they need to note a lot of movement potential thing to emerge. But within that thing that, heavy orientation about a document in this world is what is important right now to think about. That's still there. I worked through that list with you before and the notion we had very strongly was collaboration was a very important thing and one of them we wanted to be able to do right form the outset is share your screen with somebody at a distance so that you could actually call them up and collaborate. An architecture that's built in, too. We were going to give a demonstration of that today where I'd call up somebody and watch them turn on something and then go we'd see his screen and talk to him. It just go to be too much to try to put together. I'll be lucky if the rest of it works for me.</div><br><div>\tThis is what pioneering was like all the time. Okay. This is one of my most successful experiments. But I'm going to start now on a little bit of thing about why does speed and flexibility pay off? I kept in the early '60s trying to say, \"Why? If you delete it, move it, change it right in front of you and get on with your things why it'd be worth absorbing a computer's attention?\" One day I thought of this so I'd give people that brick and say begin to write. It's so clumsy and slow and fatiguing and you realize that it's just a matter of happenstance that the scale of our muscular and control systems and the tools we could build to write with let us write as adroitly as we can. What if it had been difficult relatively? It would have changed our whole culture and our whole way of thinking and our language [inaudible 00:20:14]. So I say all right, does that help you think about going the other way? All right. Anyway, the speed and flexibility which you can have your slate of tools do what you want them is an important aspect to the design. So I push this button and the slide doesn't advance.</div><br><div>\tAmong the things then, this is a picture of the very first mouse we made with, hand-carved, these two wheels right on the bare tabletop without any apology for not having a ball in between them and they worked beautifully for many years. We did a series of tests, we were looking for what's the best way to control and screen and control selection on a screen. We were getting an array of different kinds of devices and I dug into some of my old notes and there was this idea that turned out to be a mouse. We just build it to add it to the array of things we were going to test. In the tests we had different ways for weighting things for selection penalty and time and all of that to come up with different grades of goodness. The mouse kept winning. Then for so many months we would see if any one of those devices are tied to the system and people would sit down and could use whichever one they wanted and nobody used any but the mouse so then we went with the mouse.</div><br><div>\tNobody remembers who named, who thought up the name of the mouse. Everyone would have thought that it was all going to arrive out in the world much sooner than it did and no one would have thought that when it arrived in the world it would still be carrying the name mouse. Such an undignified name. This is one of the things that just, that changed but, that's a knee, and we got the most photogenic knee. The rest of her is more photogenic I think. I got to thinking about what else could you use and I tried a skate mouse, getting a board and tying it to my seat and moving it around, which you don't have very good control that way. Then I realized that when you're driving a car and working the accelerator you have very, very fine control you've learned on that. Okay, so I have a pedal, and then I want to go sideways, I'll swing my knee sideways and push my foot up and down, oh well if I push my foot up and down on the floor then my knee goes up and down so why not just make something that your knee goes up and down and your cursor goes up and down. Your knee swings side to side and this swings side to side and you can keep your hands on the keyboard. It worked beautifully except you had to stay posturely the same and my knee cramped.</div><br><div>\tI made another one that I put on my head and I moved my head around, it would move the cursor and your eyes can stay looking and it looks a little strange but for the sake of experimenting you really do all sorts of things. But then my neck got cramped. Any of those things is likely to come along some other time now and replace the mouse and I'm just assuming that that's going to happen.</div><br><div>\tThis is something we also made that the left hand uses and I have one here and I'm going to be using it and I'll show you in detail how it works. Because somehow the world can't believe that it's actually easy to learn and that it just accelerates your interaction speed. Somehow the mouse barely made it past those who said that's too hard to learn and in fact it got crippled by people putting one button on it. I'm pretty sure that that's going to give way one day. Other things, too, that are built very naturally when products have come out to the marketplace, built to sell, and when you're selling into an unseasoned market the things that attract people are very different that will attract them years later when they're really seasoned and what they know what they want, and they want performance, and by then realize how much they've actually had to learn to use this thing that was advertised and is so easy to learn and actually use. If you add up the things that you have learn to fly any of those systems it's a lot.</div><br><div>\tThe idea is saying, all right, let's learn a little more. Think a very simple code, and the computer samples and notes whenever a key goes down, and it notes how many keys, which keys went down before they're all up next time and said that's a chord, looks up in the table and sends that to the machine instead of any character you want to hit. The application system doesn't know that the characters come from your key set or you keyboard. It's purely to use as an option with one hand while the other hand is pointing.</div><br><div>\tThis is kind of the philosophy of looking at some new sort of thing you're going to learn and hope it'll boost your capability, that there's a period in which it's costing you, you're below the expected performance and you begin to get payoff from here on out. The cost of this learning business is amortizable over however long you're getting payoff, but most people sort of feel like, boy if you haven't gotten paid off within the first hour, not thinking that you as knowledge workers, for instance, are likely to spend thousands of hours, maybe average a thousand hours a year, in your professional lives, sitting there working on it. So the time you can invest is really quite high if you've got just a long payoff time coming back. This is just thinking ahead and our orientation was to look at how much value you could derive from this system and we assumed that when you learned about the value then you could figure out how to minimize the cost for getting into the value, but if you didn't know what you were going why start out with a priori assumptions about how much of a learning skill, the learning prize should be.</div><br><div>\tHere's an example. How many people do you see all geared up like this to run around in the world as compared to this? Yet this is obviously, you can go into a showroom and get on that and run it immediately. It's very much easier to learn a natural, so it's a very superior design. But you couldn't sell them to today's seasoned world that have learned a lot of refinements about how it is that you could really design a machine and learn to do it. Learning to ride one of these things is extremely unnatural and one of the reasons it's hard is because nobody understands what you do when you ride a bicycle and they tell everybody who's learning exactly the wrong things about what they should do, and then their body learns somehow anyway. Anyway, that's [inaudible 00:27:05]</div><br><div>\tBack to here. Now I'm going to have to switch over and start learning right here. One other thing, is not a very good slide, of the way our files are structured. There's actually a ring structure made of modules of six sides of beta elements that's in a link, a list structure here, with pointers in them that detects objects and a further depth of pointers if you wanted to walk through any other kind of attributes. Value, structure, that you want to put in there so that you could embed graphics or any other kind of objects within the whole and closed thing that the user thinks of as a document and then enclose graphics as you wish but also digitize feature of the things. We'd assume the document of the future was going to be like that so we built the generalized structure to go with it.</div><br><div>\tOkay, ready for the slide. Now, I can't remember ... We can't have the overheads I guess, because it'll wash this out. Right? I'd rather work in the dark and I have a better excuse. I could even hide under the table and maybe ... Can you still put that on the screen? Do you have a slide?</div><br><div>Dr. Allison:\t[inaudible 00:28:25]</div><br><div>Doug:\tOne thing that I'm going to have to do sometimes is-</div><br><div>Dr. Allison:\t[inaudible 00:28:31]</div><br><div>Doug:\tCan you dim it even more? Yeah. That's better for me. Once in a while I'm going to have to look at this image. The thing that we found out the other day when I came over to sort of check this out was that the chalk gets all over the chairs. The other thing I found out is that you're not going to be able to see the full screen and sometimes, unless I'm going to want you to see what's happening with enough detail.</div><br><div>\tFirst I'll just show you that what you're looking at is a port and I'm not sure you can see the little cursor right in the middle of the right hand window.</div><br><div>Student:\tYep.</div><br><div>Doug:\tLike that. Okay, when that cursor bumps into the edge of what you call the port it's going to, see it moves the whole thing. Actually there's about four times as much display area there. I just put some things up in these corners here, up in the top of the upper left quadrant of all of that. I work that way all the time and our virtual terminal just tells the host at the other end of the network that [inaudible 00:29:51] terminal and locally it just takes care of it this way. Breaking a window, I'm doing this for a purpose because I can flip to different areas of that to show you different things if I can remember when to go to which area. It's not the usual way I give a demonstration to realize that what I want to do is move the camera now over into this upper left hand quadrant, to move down and let, so you can read it. You can go, well, yeah, that's probably a good start. If you move your camera a little bit over so you include as much of this, yeah. Not quite that much. Great. All right.</div><br><div>\tI'll use this window full of text to do several things. One is to kind of show you the way the command things work, introduce the key set, show you the verb noun thing, and some of the ways this stuff works together before I go on to the structuring. I've been so gabby because all kinds of glorious things I'm going to not be able to show you. All right. We've all pretty soon went through people's ideas about menus. It just wouldn't hold up for moving fast. All kinds of special function keys and, wait a minute, that's not evolvable enough. The natural language has its verbs and nouns for a purpose, it's evolvable. So what do you say we work on a verb-noun basis and put the [inaudible 00:31:35] and recognizing them so you minimize how much you have to do to specify what verbs and nouns you want to employ. And why do you employ nouns? We'll show you. But first it is that I just hit, oh, I thought it had broken down in my absence and I thought that'd be very typical.</div><br><div>\tAll right. We could have said we'd like to pick the object first and then go pick the action which is the way the Macintosh and other interfaces do and sure, you can sort of go either way you like. Pick the action first and then the object or the other way around and it happens that English speaking people are used to saying, \"I want to delete a word\" rather than \"That word, please delete.\" If you are German you may want to do it the other way around. We just said, all right, let's do it this way. There's some reasons too about the coordination that works very well but in the end you can swap them and see how it really works.</div><br><div>\tOne character said delete and the other character said what kind of object you wanted to delete. By naming the kind of object you really reduce how much labor it is to specify it. I can come in and select any place in that word with a click and now I am through with the cursor, and go on. I've got an audit up in the top that says, \"I want to delete a word app\" and the exclamation point says, \"You did a select over there. All right, do it.\" And then you're talking machines sort of a syntactic issue about what it is as a word.</div><br><div>\tIf you get new objects in there you want, a balance, parentheses or sentences, or questions in computer language and code them in very simply there's a place to do that and it'll add them to the command language [inaudible 00:33:23] you've gone extend like that. When I say, \"Delete that.\" I wonder why it's going to take all day. It does. That's what we had before, take away and it always orients itself, of course and we never, always done automatic line adjust, in fact our statements, just an example of a statement, are just [inaudible 00:33:44] unless they're significant in it.. I could also say delete a character and pick a character, pick something like, sometimes I can't see that cursor there. [inaudible 00:34:00] If I wanted to put it back I would say insert character and hit the key and hit the F and then say do it.</div><br><div>\tAll right. Anyway when I hunt around on the keyboard I am a little bit clumsy. I'll show you very soon now. Two other things to say. If I want to delete a word and I say, oh, I missed that, one back space character undoes the last thing you did, so I can say delete character, and hit a C. Then if I go pick the wrong object and picked the key and meant to pick the other one I hit the backspace character and it undoes that and I can do what I want to. It's a very nice command language interpreter. It's got all the back up, very clean, and you get the audit up above of what you want to do. When you get a more complex vocabulary command it's just handy to have the feedback. It'd be very interesting then to merge this with some of the other styles where it happens right in place. I got no objection to that. All right, now what if you want to d the combination? There. Sorry about that. There you are.</div><br><div>\tSee how it works together. If I wanted to delete a word I'd hit D and W with my left hand and I'd pick the word and execute it. I want to insert a new one right there so I'd say insert word and A and D and then it does that. And I'm all done. I want to move a word I'd say move that word, provide the follow 4. And it does and I don't cut and paste because I like the verb move and I'm telling what object to move so it knows how to do it when it goes in there. If I say copy this word what do you think aught to happen when it says copy that word? Well, we'll just try it and see. It copies all the [inaudible 00:36:02]. What comes across is that [inaudible 00:36:04] verbs.</div><br><div>\tYou'd say, well that's funny, what if I wanted the whole thing? We call that a visible, copy visible, and then other noun types, and you see if I copy that over there it brings the other extension. It wasn't long before you start thinking of different kind of objects as long as you're picking them. It really supports more of what you're doing in there. There's another object in there that if I looked at that right and I'd say, \"What is all this here?\" What do I care? Call it an invisible. Replace that invisible in there to one space. It's just a screen of non-printed characters and boom. You can copy, delete, replace, move invisible. In fact you just replace all that very quickly.</div><br><div>\tAnyway, the combination of these things allowing you not to have to take your eyes off the screen for much of what you're doing when you're doing your editing in short literals you just start flying and when you have to take that away and move the keyboard and the mouse I'll work on a Lisa or a Macintosh and my left arm just starts aching because it's just sitting there unemployed. It's a little better, these control character things you can do but it's just nothing like that.</div><br><div>\tOkay, so much for command language and just the way the combination things work and I can go over here and say I want to go to the next thing on there. I'm employing something I will teach you about a little later. Okay. We'll leave a screen size put down on that just for a little bit more so you're sure you can be able to see what's on the screen. Here are terms that you saw on that last slide. Open ended vocabulary, fast concurrent control. I'd say all right, in order to, let me just show you what I actually had there. This way without any structure and this is the way it actually was structured so I'd say all right, I'm going to show it with a structure. You see computer storage and file position are now categories and these other things being underneath it. I'd say that's nice, I like the structure. In fact if I wanted to I can say, well, show me a little more explicitly the structure and then it'll actually show you what we call the location numbers in there and those are plain to sort of see a little more. If you said, well I'm going to move that one to follow that one down a level you'd see its name, its location would be 3D1. Whereas when it's up at this other level it's 3D, 3C.</div><br><div>\tI don't think there's any strong explanation needed for what the structure naming is in there. There's a nice thing about saying because I'm dealing with structure now I got a term called move, what if I say move branch? I want to move that branch to follow this branch. Okay, and do it. So it does it and I went from here to here with just one move operation not having to cut and paste in the first place and not having to figure out where, how to delimit something that structurally is very evident to the machine. There's even commands like transpose, I can transpose words, I can transpose branches, I can transpose statements very easily. Anyways, the idea of carrying this kind of command language on into structures proving very, very valuable for us all the time. Then the other sort of thing of viewing, you've already seen viewing where you say, all right, I like it with numbers or I like it without numbers because the relative indentation tells me what it is structurally and if I add the numbers to it, it just gives a little more exact location so much of the time I'd just as soon work in there because when I move this thing to go after that one I don't really care what, whoops, it was in there for a purpose, see.</div><br><div>\tLet's say there are other kinds of adjusting. You notice how the item is now 4, you know with 3 before. Of course it's structure numbers, location numbers change if you change the structure and many times you'd say I would not like to that. There's another way that you can say change the view. I lose track of my cute little cursor, there it is. All sorts of strange things have been happening. Everybody getting says of course that's just something that long during the demo and you say probably yeah, that probably happens to him all the time. One of the data attributes that's on every node is on the serial number and when that node was created it was given a new one and it's kept no matter where you move it. If you print it out you can print out the trace with these statement identifiers, or node identifier numbers and any time later, even it's been rearranged you can go and look at a particular node because that follows it around no matter how much editing you do to it and every time you create a new statement, I'll put a new one in there. See it, it's got the next higher serial number. I delete it and insert another one and it should be 17. The 0 in front of it just avoids any of the confusion about, are you talking about location number along the top level or the serial.</div><br><div>\tYou've got those things and you can something called a jump, so you can jump and I can jump by pointing and come to that place. I'll say jump return and I'll go back to where I was or I can say jump to an item and give it its SID. There again the key sets, you type the numbers or any special characters you want if you're using ... When you're typing in literals two of these keys are used to sort of case shift, they'll give you 7 bits and if you want to learn the rest of it you'll enter any character you want and it pays off mightily. You can jump by that or you can jump ... I'm going to go back where I was next time I go back I'm going to put on the other numbers. I could say also go to 4 and it'll go to 4, jump return, it goes back. It doesn't matter what number's showing, I can say go to 01O again because it's still, underneath it's still got that SID internal number.</div><br><div>\tAnother thing that you can do, you can say to, ask any statement, you can say show what we call a name delimiters in that statement. Down underneath some of the attributes again are a pair of characters and all it says is anytime when you're at that statement it gets, those two characters get checked. Then the very first word in that statement is it's delimited by those characters, hash code it and put it in the name table because it has now become an assigned name, a label for that statement. Well down here, VG. Just look at that one and say yes that's got the same colons so VG is the name. I can say jump item to VG and it's going to go to it just as if you'd said jump to 3D or whatever other number it was.</div><br><div>\tThis kind of addressing, accessible, and there's also all kinds of relative addressing and that paper we handed out outlines all the kinds of addressing that's actually available to you. One kind of think now, if I say ... I'm just inserting something in here. Like I said, I'm saying here's a link. It says address to VG and it's got some view specifications saying what sequence things to do when you get there to view. And it wants to [inaudible 00:45:01] This thing called a link writes some particular passage in any file you want and it says when I get there here's the view. What it types is a view of a given set of objects. What you had in mind when you were talking about it, so it just makes it very flexible to move around. How is the time? Am I reading right, it's 2 minutes after 5? Well, the other 80 percent of what I had ready to show you ...</div><br><div>\tA bunch of slides, there's some discussion of a system called a journal and if you take a look at your document that you have here and think of several unique characteristics. In the top left, top right of every page you see OAD comma 2250, comma. There's a journal system, we're given the name OAD, and this was the 2250th item that was submitted to it, and anytime afterwards from now on you ask for that item number and it'll go retrieve this document. No one's had a chance to change it. It's like it was published and you don't have to worry about archiving it, it's all kept you for it and archivable. And further down the right hand column we say let's publish, print, the actual location number because since the document is frozen out there and published no one's going to change it so these are always going to remain valid. That means that anytime you want it you just send a message to someone and said, \"Hey, look at branch 6D in OAD 2250 and go there.\" If you want to get back with me I'll show you what happens. Am I going to get kicked out of here here? Everybody runs over doesn't he? [inaudible 00:46:54]</div><br><div>Male:\t[inaudible 00:46:59]</div><br><div>Doug:\tAnd then we'll take questions. Then we'll take roll call. Can I have the, back on the screen? And the lights dimmed? All right. All right. I can just say change the view here like this. What I want to do is break this window and I want to figure out where to break it. I'm going to go, go look at something that counts. It tells me how many lines, why don't you drop down now? You don't have to watch my hands so give me the whole window as being on the screen. Good. Let me just break this about here. [inaudible 00:48:11] Some days it doesn't say.</div><br><div>\tI moved that quickly. Oh, I know. The TV's not looking at the whole ...</div><br><div>\tAll right. Now I ought to be able to break this. Okay. Now I got a small window here and another one right under it. If I go back to the file where I was and hit jump return and let me just ... What'd I say? OAD 2250 6D. If I don't have much room in there I'm going to just say ... OAD 2250 6D we'll just do like that, all right. Great, let's go and see if it's what I see. Bingo, there it is. I'm looking at just the first line of those two paragraphs and if I add, if I say show me the first two lines and put a blank space between them you see it looks like that. I'd say well just draw me everything in this window and it's pretty hard, well come down and look at this and give me a little bit more chance in this size of window to see, okay.</div><br><div>\tAnyway, it's just that easy to make a citation to anything prior published in here. Even mail message that comes through, can point to it but if it's in another generalized document and you just have recorded dialogue that goes on it's just extremely powerful and it's hard to realize how much power that gives over just plain that says, yeah, if you looked at my file I had a document that was archived but somebody's keeping track of it. It's like, writing and publishing a paper in which you cite some other paper but you don't know whether the person has access to a library or not so you'd say, well I'm going to have to qualify and add a lot of context and you can get the idea without going look at it. Here you can just point to any passage, not just your document, and say I'm confident that I can look at it so, it's not a book, so in one sentence you can point to this passage and say, hey, this thing's counter to what's specified here but it might be ameliorated by what was set up here in the general policy and just one sentence with 3 links you've just communicated a great deal and it's answered in there and people can find it.</div><br><div>\tThese journal items are put in and they've got, when you submit it to the journal there's a catalog that keeps track of title and other things like key words and search processes over it so you can go find items by that nature. A big amount of the power comes from the network of links that point on to things like that. I had a whole series of, I've got 8 minutes exactly? I've got a few more minutes? Why don't I show you a few examples of ... well. [inaudible 00:52:04]</div><br><div>\tAnyway, this is showing you some mail items and showing you the kinds of explicit data elements that you can use and one this here is that this things is a document destined to go in the journal. It has to, I'm looking at only one line so we see this, kind of go into the Augment Journal which is the oldest of them. It's been running since 1970 and there are 103,000 or more items that have been submitted to that journal. Access in this case in unrestricted and it goes on and tells you the comment that you're talking about and you can go look at author. Who was the author in the matter, who submitted keywords? That supersedes, augments this one, so if you later jump to Augment 101530 it'll automatically tell you, so that's been superseded. Do you want the new one or the old one? If you say jump to link on that and it goes there and it comes out and it says hey, that's not on this host online right now. Do you want it retrieve? All you have to do is click yes and the operator gets an automatic message that says get it off [inaudible 00:53:29] so I'm going to put it on and the message comes back via email saying okay, it's on now.</div><br><div>\tIt's just a very, very powerful way to operate in the journal. While I'm jumping on links on this list over on the right it's just like having a, having a menu I can just point and go click but really there's just a link in there that moves me over here. It says all right, I got a publications list. That's another one of the journal items, a one page list of publications which is passed out. Incidentally Professor Allison, I'll get him a copy each of those so anyone who's interested in anymore of our publications can get in touch with him. I don't know what he's going to do about it but he said he would do something.</div><br><div>\tAnyway, I can go look at the same publication list and I just, I wanted a view that's just the top level, first line and numbers like that. I can scan through that and if you'd work in a larger window of course you'd get more flexibility. If I say jump to the next little example thing I've got in here and that says, oh, go to that authorship entry and look at the whole statement. There it goes to the entry, that's the entry in there for the other paper I handed out before link 1, so it's a bibliographic entry in that one so great. At the end of that, and I got kicked off, unfortunately. Let's just see if ...</div><br><div>\tYeah, there it is. It shows a journal number down at the end. OAD 2250 down in the bottom, [inaudible 00:55:19] 220. Every item that 20 has a journal item, the later ones when we had the journal working and could get in. Let's go to the next example statement that says, oh, you want to go through this entry list. Here's the thing about the links, addressedly. It says go to this [inaudible 00:55:38] 1968 which is this journal item that has the list. Then it says go to item 20 on it. Then that period L says, oh, and when you get to 20 take the link and follow it. It's going to go down and take this link, OAD 2250 and then the [inaudible 00:55:55] says when you get there go to the top and look for number 1. It's going to go to the first statement and give you an overview. It's an indirect addressing scheme.</div><br><div>\tThis indirection of linkage following around is something that can be very powerful if you want to do it [inaudible 00:56:09] there and looking at the top level of this document that I gave you like that. In the journal, like sitting at a library, I'd make a copy whether or pilot thing, I can very quickly copy from it or do what I wish but that I know is the original that was put. If I want to just try something I'll say oh, among the things that's stored down in the attributes [inaudible 00:56:34] list in there is the name, the identity of the last person that changed it and the date and time that it was edited. See, those things really were put together in December of '83.</div><br><div>\tI was going to, someplace there look at a little bit of source code and that's really interesting. All the source code for Augment is stored like this and this kind of flexibility for bombing around gives you a lot of power and anytime you want to you can see which who edited this last. It's very interesting. [inaudible 00:57:09] Some of it goes back, is dated about '70, '71, doesn't it? It's still ...</div><br><div>\tOkay, let's look at the next example. This goes there directly. Now I got myself in trouble. Let's look at that same statement in this window and see it says, go directly to OAD 2250 and go to item 7. That's the view control one. I'll say all right, go to item 7 and I want to look at just the first few levels under there. You tell somebody, oh, you should look up business about controlling the view, here's the citation. Then this person's in there and he can wander around and look at the rest of the system if he wants.</div><br><div>\tAnyway. Here's another one. In our user guide there's something called a locator and so you just go look at that locator. The locator has a bunch of other things, you'd say, oh, augment 2 of the features. What's that? Go look, open up another level. That system's utilities, features, what about features? I'll go look at that, command sequences. What if I look at command sequences? Then you're there. This is just using the ordinary basic capability to Augment but giving you a hierarchical classification system which falls out of the [inaudible 00:58:27] Over and over again those basic characteristics prove to be valuable.</div><br><div>\tOne thing that you see hidden down here is documents, see. All right, you've got, so there's a link off to where you find the documentation for all the documentation that's stored online and is findable through this locator like that. And so I just go through them all, except I promised to quit wasting time. I was going to show you source code which would be-</div><br><div>Dr. Allison:\tWhy don't you take a few questions and remind everyone to use their microphone?</div><br><div>Questioner 1:\tHave you tried to apply conventional information retrieval algorithms to some of these very large text files that you just want to find an individual key word, have you tried a bunch of those sort of techniques to identify information when you don't remember the citation or the link?</div><br><div>Doug:\tWe have some various scanning, you can jump to words. Part of our architecture is there's a sequence generator that hands it to a compiler or a printer or a printer or a display generator, a sequence of node data. You've got options of flipping in a different sequence generator if you want. One of the standard options is you can say as you're getting the candidate and the view specification says how deep into the hierarchy you want to go?</div><br><div>\tAs you're getting these candidates apply this scan to it and if it doesn't pass go on to the next and don't hand along the pass so that kind of functioning shows up on your screen and you can write a little scanning program for, as statistical as you want to. There's simple ones that you can just get compiled and executed right on the spot or you can write a whole program and flip it in there [inaudible 01:00:17] That's one kind of thing but it's not as efficient as you'd like. Then I've made those that will go through and you can make a complex scanning pattern and tell it to [inaudible 01:00:28] with the documents you want it to go through and go off and run and I tell it who I want to put the hit list. What it does with the hit list is extract passages from a hit statement and a link off to it. You come back later and look at that and put that in the window and just go look at the things. One of the things I would hope for of course is that we'd get a community of users that would include people who were really interested in these different aspects and they can start using that kind of technique.</div><br><div>\tAnother aspect is that the architecture and this modular flexibility and interface thing is built so that it would be very easy to slip in smart AI module in there to do all kinds of different task for the user community. This is always assume you do that. There' some chance that a lot of this will pick up some momentum again in the next year because among large corporations that are finding a lot of these architectural and document and linkage and all that characteristics are going to be very important and there isn't any other prototype that's got all these things wrapped up and even if it is sitting on very old machinery and you've got source code in it that's got 1970 dates it's still the only thing in existence that embodies a lot of that and is a very good pilot. There's some chance to do that and also they're trying a way, the stuff about porting it over and doing it with sort of more up-to-date interfaces than some of the standards that exist now and just make an integrated merge. It's exciting that that may happen because it's been very frustrating through the years, how things get popular and when first the market comes out and everybody's got a personal computer. Everyone's so excited and it [inaudible 01:02:15] that you can't really tell them about the things that aren't right in front of them, like even you guys might even remember ...</div><br><div>\tAll of us humans are like that so it just, the world's changing now and it's exciting to see about the integration of a lot of that potential. I'll make shorter questions. If they give me shorter questions I'll make shorter answers.</div><br><div>Student  2:\tYou might also pointing out that you're running over a telephone line, 2400 [inaudible 01:03:53].</div><br><div>Doug:\tOh, yeah. There's a lot of things designed in that to minimize the amount of information having to be sent back and so all the windowing, there's a lot of things, lots of things built into that that would be fun to, it'd take hours and hours and hours to show you the different basic things that were built in that, many of them are so unique.</div><br><div>Questioner 2:\tThe Mac that you have been using on your left, on your left.</div><br><div>Doug:\tThat's, my key set?</div><br><div>Questioner 2:\tIs that a replacement of the keyboard sort of speaking because I've noticed you have been entering all the commands with that rather than the mouse and I guess my [inaudible 01:04:41] that has the three buttons on your right hand side.</div><br><div>Doug:\tWell, the roll of this is that it's an alternative or optional replacement of this when it's more useful. If you're typing straight text this is considerably faster. This is actually easier to learn, by quite a bit. 30 words a minute and you're hammering pretty hard. I actually was doing this one time, I had put one on each hand, I'd go faster. But anyway, it's for saying if this hand is busy pointing why not give it a chance to do something here and so instead of picking an object and then picking what you want to do about it you're saying what you want to do while you're on your way to picking the object and you're doing things in parallel that otherwise would be in tandem and you're employing both hands and you've got your eyes on the screen and that combination just starts making it really fly. You shift over to this, some people shift if they've got more than 2 characters in a row to type and some wait until it's 8 or 9. Does that help you?</div><br><div>Questioner 2:\tYes, it did. Also one other question from me. I'm sorry, I don't know your last name. The gentleman mentioned about that this was available through a telephone line, through some sort of database or some network or something. Would that be, and you mentioned about the community of users that would be able to, what information besides that the hand out that you handed us, what other information that are available for us to ...</div><br><div>Doug:\tI guess we can't get commercial here. That's been available for many years as a sort of subscription service over Tymnet or ARPANET. The qualified ARPANET users can get at it that way, over Tymnet. Instead of buy it by the resource time or by the fractions of the machine that you get on, but it's been kind of a specialized small business off to the side and they couldn't, the overhead of dealing with lots of small customers beat them so they kind of aren't really looking for that so try to get larger organizations and sell it by bulk.</div><br><div>Questioner 2:\tHow could schools use [inaudible 01:07:15]</div><br><div>Doug:\tI would just love to get it moved in and there's some chance that we could start unlocking that and find a way to subsidize a little bit and get it in because you've just-</div><br><div>Questioner 2:\tPerhaps they are available for the learning center or something for students to just go in and check [inaudible 01:07:29]</div><br><div>Doug:\tIt only runs on a deck 20. It's not exactly the most modern equipment. Transporting it is roughly estimated as very expensive and people laughed for quite a while but now it made me realize that because it is a very unique, large combination of things that, the assemblage of them has a lot of synergy among them all. The journal is very powerful because of the links and many of the other things add up.</div><br><div>Questioner 2:\tThank you.</div><br><div>Questioner 3:\tIs source code available for the 20? Can we port it to our machine?</div><br><div>Doug:\tMarch it's coming out proprietary, source code available, well it's a propriety thing sold by McDonnell Douglas' Information Systems Group. I'd really like to unlock and open its current version up and get it public and get a lot of dialogue going while the proprietary oriented people start re-specifying what they do to go and modernize it all. There's a lot of very valuable experience that could be ... [inaudible 01:08:33]</div><br><div>Questioner 3:\tThank you guys.</div><br><div>Doug:\t[inaudible 01:08:35] That worked for us way back in the early '60s.</div><br><div>Questioner 4:\t3 short questions, Doug. 1 is, what is Augment written in now? Secondly, would things have been different if Pascal and Modular-2 were available in '65, and the third thing is would you just comment on Guide and how close you think it comes to hypertext or what you might want to see in things?</div><br><div>Doug:\tWritten in a language called [inaudible 01:09:04] that evolved through stages of, when we had about our third machine we moved to in 1968 was an early time sharing system that had only a very bad FORTRAN and we were already beyond where assembly language was easy to manage. That FORTRAN was too horrible to contemplate so [inaudible 01:09:27] was here and [inaudible 01:09:32] was excited about machine oriented compilers so we built one of those and it evolved with some meta-compiler compiler. The language now with more flexibility than C but not typing and such, the module and all that. If it were transported I'm not sure. And Guide I haven't tried.</div><br><div>Questioner 5:\tI'm just wondering if you mentioned access to documents. I'm interesting in conference editing sessions. Have you dealt with the problems involved with multiple users wanting to access and edit simultaneously documents or collaborating on the editing of an individual document?</div><br><div>Doug:\tYeah. We got down once to looking at the actual locking and unlocking of individual statements to say, could that go on and you'd be editing one statement and I'd be editing another. There was some trial designs made of that but it was never carried through but it'd be possible to isolate the different parts and even have privacy or access locks on individual nodes in there. There's enough space for the data in there.</div><br><div>\tThe thing we do in sharing though, a lot, is you can make your comments off with links pointing to passages so this gives you a very powerful way to line up a couple windows and go see what so and so said he wanted to do. Somebody else doing it. Or if you wanted to we used a shared screen mode where we could get 2 to 4 people all shared, wherever they are in the country, talking on a conference phone call, looking at the same thing. I can pass controls over to you so you see how you'd like the make a change and we all argue about it. [inaudible 01:11:21] I'll set it like it ought to be. It had those things going but there are many pathways of exploring, and we just had to truncate most all of them because there's always only so much you can do at any given stage and we follow any one path for, sort of, [inaudible 01:11:43] diminishing returns. There's many, many things that are, very interesting exploratory things to do with the system the way it is and many things would be easy to add to this system that open up other power. Now, that's the real answer.</div><br><div>Radio:\tKKCY. Predictably unpredictable. 989FM. The city.</div><br><div></div>",

I'm a director advanced computing environments, and it's my privilege to open the conference by introducing Dan Lynch, the President of Advanced Computing Environments. If you look around this morning, you'll see several thousand people here this morning. Indeed, by the end of this week, by expect about 10,000 of your colleagues will have visited the exhibits, or attended the conference, or participated in the tutorials of which there were about 2,500 in the last few days.</div><br><div>\tAll of us at Advanced Computing are proud that we can bring you this conference, but the one person who really made it possible is Dan Lynch. He sensed the need for more information about networking, he developed the concepts, he brought together the staff to get it started, and he worked long and hard hours over the earlier [InterOp 00:00:51] conference. Most of you know Dan, for those who don't let me just give you a few details. He's a network guru, he won his spurs on the ARPANET, the internet, and TCPIP at SRI, ISI, and McDonald Douglas. He's also a mathematician holding an M.S. in Math from UCLA, and most importantly he's an acknowledged wine authority. Please join me in welcoming Dan Lynch. Thank you.</div><br><div>Dan Lynch:\tThank you very much, David. We're pretty good at debugging networks, but video production I guess isn't our strong suit this morning but we're getting it going. We have a great crew here. The problem was simple; Doug Engelbart, who is our main speaker, made a simple request when he came and saw the facility. Said, [\"Gee 00:01:44], I'd like to look at the slides too.\" So we're having to deal with that, and I think it'll work out fine.</div><br><div>\tDoug Engelbart, as John Pastel and I once said to each other about five or six years ago, is the father of us all in so much of what we do in this business and he started thinking about these problems in the 50s. I really wanted to bring him to you today to have him describe to you his visions for the future. Doug is always about 25 years ahead of where we are. He sounded crazy a long time ago. He may sound crazy today also, and he doesn't mind that. He's got a good track record. He invented the mouse, Windows, Hypertext ... they didn't always call these things those words when he did his original research, but that's what they've come out to be.</div><br><div>\tNow, I'm going to stop giving him much of an introduction because I really want to have him introduce himself. If we could roll the tape, you will see Doug Engelbart in earlier years, if and when the tape is rolling, at a 1968 conference. Is it rolling?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart:\t[Medium 00:03:16] Here for the rest of the show, and I should tell you I'm backed up with quite a staff of people between here and Menlo Park where Stanford research is located, some thirty miles south of here. If everyone [else 00:03:29] does their job well, it'll all go very interesting I think. The research program that I'm going to describe to you is quickly characterizable by saying, If in your office, you as an intellectual worker, were supplied with a computer display backed up by a computer that was alive for you all day and was instantly responsive to every action you had, how much value could you derive from that?\"</div><br><div>\tWell, this basically characterizes what we've been pursuing for many years in what we call the AUGMENT Human Intellect Research Center at Stanford Research Institute. Look what else we can do in here. I've got this file that's structured. If I want to see what's in there, I can walk down the hierarchy levels and see or return ... but there's another thing I can do. This route I said I have here ... so here, I'm afraid I'll need a different picture to do.</div><br><div>\tHere's what I drew with the picture drawing capability here, it's a slight map if I start from work, and here's the route I seem to have to go to to pick up all the materials and that's my plan for getting home tonight. That if I want to, I can say \"The library, what am I supposed to pick up there?\" I can just point to that, and oh, I see. Overdue books and all. Well, there's a statement there with that name on it. Go back, what am I supposed to pick up at the drug store? Hmm, I see very [interesting 00:05:08]. All right, market? Oh I've already seen that, [buy some 00:05:14] like that. Gee, that's too much.</div><br><div>\tAnyway, so we have this feature of structuring our material hierarchically. Being able to move around it very well. When we get a hierarchy, such as I can show you here now, I can do things if I want to just say, \"I'd like to interchange produce and canned materials.\" Bingo. They're all numbered rightly if I care to look, interchanging them very quickly. Cans are going to get interchanged with produce. They do it and all gets renumbered. I have ways of starting over, making different views, moving around, going to specified points, and modifying the structure. At the same time I've seen that I have a repertoire of different entities like character, knock off that character. Replace the character, make that P.</div><br><div>\tI have entities of all sorts and I can say I want to do operations on, and this basic structure I can move over and study and get about very quickly. That is the essence now. That's the essence of the tool we have. [There are a 00:06:34] lot of details that I've left out for you, and now I'd like to stop a minute and just make sure you understand we're shifting from illustrative material to the real working stuff, in case you wouldn't recognize it otherwise.</div><br><div>\tWe've used this tool to do our daily work and it's ... Our system has been built ... This time sharing system for about six months now it's been working, and in that time, we've gone from getting one console to getting about six working now, with six more due the rest of Spring. This is our fourth computer in which we've had this kind of a system, so we've learned a lot about user features we want and how to be thoroughly skillful. But this next step about learning how when you're faced with having this in your office all day, as I now do in a very exciting sense, how do you get that to work for yourself? How do you organize your files, what kind of things do you do? To get going on this, let's switch away from the tool we have here [crosstalk 00:07:37]</div><br><div>Dan Lynch:\tOkay, let's cut the film now and get ... Can we cut the film please? Okay, now lets go live with Doug Engelbart. Doug is now with Stanford University and is head of a project that he has initiated called the Bootstrap Project. I think that Doug will give us some insight into his plans for the future. Doug Engelbart.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart:\tFine. Thanks very much, Dan. It's hard to believe that was 21 years ago. It's hard for me to believe it too. What I'd like to do today though is sort of talk to you some about in the general pursuit that I was committed to in those days and I've been ever since, there are differences in the concepts that a person generates. One person will look at a problem issue with one set of concepts and a framework, and another look in another framework picture, and they go about it in very different ways. I began by being very much motivated about what the computers and communication technology could do for organizations. The whole motivation was that by 1962 I generated a think piece that I call my conceptual framework. That's [when 00:09:25] I think I credit it with producing most of the sort of ... things that were very different for the day in there because it was the way I was thinking about \"Ah, you can augment people. Not automate them.\"</div><br><div>\tWhat I'd like to do today is sort of share some of those conceptual things and mix them in with a sequence of explicit evolutionary things we did. Some of which are still sort of different from what's accepted in the flow of things, but I think that they'll be coming. At least they deserve a fair amount of ... I can't read it from here at this angle, so I can just sort of see it's the same slide I started out with.</div><br><div>\tAll right, so the idea of a knowledge workshop grew early in my concept, and the idea of a knowledge workshop that's organized for an organization to support it was there by the very early 70s. The realization that it needed to be an integrated knowledge workshop came also by that time. We were lucky enough to get involved with the ARPANET from the very very first, and because of my interest in organizations and collaboration, I volunteered to start up the Network Information Center. Because of that role we're going to play, my computer at SRI was the second one connected to the ARPANET, and so a lot of my people were involved with the protocols and the establishment of all that through the years. Very early we got into that.</div><br><div>\tThe integrated and the architecture, and the Hypertext, and the role of all of that plays in there. I'd like to sort of show you [net 00:11:19] in with ... Okay, historically, we sort of got shoved into the commercial world in 1978 at Tymshare and selling the service of a system we called AUGMENT then. It was what you saw on that film was NLS for online system in those days. When we went commercial, we changed to a name that people would find some kind of meaning to, so some PR person labeled it AUGMENT.</div><br><div>\tAUGMENT had an interesting history by supporting thousands of customers in dozens of organizations over the network from about 1974 till about a year and a half ago. It got to the point of one very large Air force command with thousands of users put in five name frames, and was using it as an organization information system, and it really did very, very unique things. Then they went out for a RFP to say, \"Let's go worldwide with this.\" The trouble was, it was just before the emergence of the terms computer support or cooperative work, collaboration, Hypertext as something popular. The people that would have to put up money to [port 00:12:45] our system into a modern environment so it would be a candidate just couldn't get the nerve to do it.</div><br><div>\tThey waffled and pulled back and they rewrote the RFP, so it didn't have a lot of the characteristics required that we had in it. A little over a year ago, RFP got won by AT&T for $940 million or something like that, and so then AUGMENT sort of got retired. But, in 1984 the aerospace ... McDonald Douglas wanted to get into the information systems business so they bought Tymshare and Tymnet. Way off in the corner was the little AUGMENT service. I began about five years ago then to trek back and forth to St. Louis to Headquarters trying to interest the aerospace side into the kind of architectural things and the document support systems that we had. Slowly, through having several pilot operations going and all, that has crept in so ...</div><br><div>\tA year ago, McDonnell Douglas fired off a four year program with something like $60 million behind it, to produce and try to go for an integrated architecture throughout the spectrum of design, manufacture, and field support. They've called CAD, CAM, [CALS 00:14:06]. A good bit of the architectural things I'll breeze through, and I'll nick into that. We're getting them very much interested in the Hypertext and it's wide area collaboration sort of thing, the special modes that we built. Now, they're people trying to build requirements for what we call and open hyper document system that would support all that.</div><br><div>\tIf I blitz through, you'd see all this [neat 00:14:34] into into the world ... have to be able to read the [darn 00:14:39] slides. Would it ruin the video? Can you track me if I get down on the floor? I think [my 00:14:50] being able to see is probably more important than ... Very nice, that's my ... I look best in profile. Maybe somebody could read it to me.</div><br><div>\tAll right. In the world that you guys are more or less involved in, the concepts of server and client are pretty important. My assumption is that there are times that a server also functions as a client in the next stage thing. That if we just propagate that a little bit we say \"Well, in general what we want are humans are sort of the ultimate client, and we would like system supporting the humans directly.\" They generally would think of that as complex functionality involving his workstation that supports him, but in turn can be a client to get service out in the network, and this is sort of the concept we went on.</div><br><div>\tIn fact, you'd like it to be a manager for you, that would manage your access in a very uniform, integrated way to all of the servers out there. This is the sort of thing we started working on way back. Then you get [all beyond 00:16:13] you and say, \"Well, conceptually, I'd like to think of it as a whole organization looking at that service window in a unified way, that lets it work as an evolving organization and not as a bunch of people independently accessing multiple kinds of things.\" The inter-operability  ability of the people is going to be very important in this organization.</div><br><div>\tThis is sort of the concepts that were driving us by the very early 70s, so this is a paper that I gave in the 1973 Spring Joint Computer Conference. In fact it's numbered by the same way. It's a file that we can still jump to. Special interest here is item three that we're going to go into, and I can't read the rest of them enough to go into detail. We don't have that much time, anyway. What we're going to do is the equivalent of jumping to item three and opening up one more level, and we see and hear the kind of things about a knowledge workshop. That's why I really was introducing that concept, was saying \"If you're going to do knowledge work, think of equipping yourself with the kind of tools, and the organized way in which your work flows, as you would in a workshop. Think of yourself as a craftsmen in there doing work, and think of the skills that you must achieve etc, to make that work flow. Then think of a knowledge organization as a giant workshop for that, and how do you go to work in there?\"</div><br><div>\tThese are the particular issues that we were dealing with in that talk, and the next to the bottom in there, where we're talking about domains, workshop domains is something I'm going to pick up on. Other items in there about the classes of users that are going to be and must be taken care of, and classes of workstation and terminals. If we go on here, I'll skip that part which ... I can't read that well anyway. Here I'll get into some elevated technology that looking at the very simple model of a person sitting at a terminal working through an operating system to an application package, this could be your workstation. When I use \"terminal\" in these cases, I mean the actual hardware that you interact with, and a workstation in my picture is a terminal plus a processor. The terminal is the display, the cursor control devices, your keyboard, a loud speaker, microphone, whatever else is that which you interact with directly, and the support.</div><br><div>\tVery, very early in the 60s it became clear that there were two parts to deal with in that application package. One was the interaction with the user, and the other was the substantive work. I kept running into the problem, the programmers who did the substantive part of it thought that since they know what's going on inside, that they ought to decide on the interface. With much internal stress on our project, we said no. By 1968, we had actually separated and started evolving a second language by which you describe what that interface was going to be. Then this begins to evolve, and [you 00:19:20] says, \"Well, why not go on from there, to say why not one application independent user interface system that's just your general way that gives you a homogeneous and unified way to look at your involvement?\"</div><br><div>\tWell from there, since we got involved in the networks very early, and like ... By 1968, [out of Hawaii 00:19:40] they were using a radio network that had the collision avoidance principles that the Ethernet had. It was very clear by the early 70s that the technology was going to keep evolving and this would be the general way in which organizations were equipped and working. What we wanted to do is say, \"Let's not get embroiled in the fights about, everything can go in the terminal since many computers or microcomputers are going to get cheaper and cheaper. Let's just talk about the connectedness we want, and let as the technology evolves, the different modules can move back and around in there, depending on the technological support of capacity in your workstation, and speed, and cost of inter-communications.\"</div><br><div>\tThis was the kind of a picture then we get of saying, your terminal equipment is connected through this user interface system to a virtual bus that kind of start in your work station and go out as far as you want. Connect you with all of the different application packages, and that there'd be one special ... Aha! One special segment of that in there that you sort of call your own work place or work shop. Very private feeling like that. The the files n the organization in there should support sort of the multi-domain kinds of things that you do as an individual very flexibly. Then the other things considered to be reached through from that, so, mail and editing and all the things you want to do are in there unified way.</div><br><div>\tThe very first stage of that was saying, \"Well, what we want is a virtual terminal controller so that applications look out at the virtual terminal.\" We had several level virtual terminal specification by the mid 70s and implemented that way. A remote procedure called protocol, that was a very robust sort of thing, by which our system was made. By '76, this was our third generation of all of this, I guess, and it was really working very effectively. What we wanted as the evolution ... [release 00:21:55] the evolution here from any particular terminal. We want to be sure that different users, classes of users, have a chance of evolving their terminals very easily. That provides for one kind of evolution, which was an important thing all the way through. How does you allow the organization's workshop to evolve?</div><br><div>\tThe next one is very important ... Here I just give some examples of three more procedure calls that you can have various ... Oh no, this is a case where a server here serving you, in turn, is a client for a server here. A call can come through to this one, evokes one back to here, and that service is integrated into something in here that in turn serves this person. This model, to us, gave the option for, for instance, AI modules being put into the network in this way. In other words, the evolution could go on very flexibly if all the servers out into the network.</div><br><div>\tThe other one was that it would sense you could actually have different manufacturers and so on, user interface systems as long as they obeyed the same protocol in the same virtual terminal. These concepts of virtual terminals in this sense are fairly strongly embedded in what the McDonnell Douglas's integrated architecture pursuit. They're really going to try to go after that as much as they can. In a big organization, the time it takes to integrate all the different software packages is a huge, huge factor, [it outweighs 00:23:29] off from the cost of the service itself.</div><br><div>\tThis is the other very important thing for us in there, and ... that have a command language interpreter that watched and got every event the user did, and interpreted according to the grammar file, and the user's profile file to know what to do back in the interaction. Occasionally, pass something off here that got converted to a more procedure call and evoked the service that came out and supported the virtual terminal, etc. This gave us the flexibility for individual but at least classes of users to evolve their vocabulary, and the concept of an open ended vocabulary was just with us from the beginning. That grew out of our concepts, too.</div><br><div>\tThat you have to have it, that it can be open ended, and this is one of the things where, looking at the strong trends toward icon pictures, that the sense that it's going to run out of open ended field. We stuck with ... avoided ... They had such things as menus and what you call \"light buttons\", the equivalent of icons, all were conceptually there in the '60s. My sort of simple-minded ergonomic look at it says \"No, they will run out of gas so we will use verbs and nouns, and then, whatever your user profile, this thing will allow you in the presentation of that and the recognition when the menus or icons [are at 00:25:02]. That's fine.\"</div><br><div>\tThen what's very important is to add a script interpreter into the command language interpreter. Then, in this sense, the script language can be exactly the verbs and nouns as the user sees them [in 00:25:20] the profile. It really starts freeing up the evolution of the vocabulary and the operations that go, so that part of evolutionary freedom was very, very important. Another extremely important thing that we began by the very early 70s to want to do shared screen work. I remember doing something, I guess it was probably 1972, with somebody from Rome, New York and I in Menlo Park. We're sharing the screen, working on a document together.</div><br><div>\tThe way by the time all this matured, it's done is a load of special grammar that does your conferencing connection, and you and the guy talk on the phone and the results in another connection through the network. It disconnects the viewers operation path here, so that everything that goes down the line of the virtual terminal here comes down to his virtual terminal. Even if they're using different equipment, he gets as much as possible of the same picture. This guys in control, and they're talking on the telephone. Then you can go through the process where his keyboard and mouse actions, and stuff, act on the service, so you can pass the baton around.</div><br><div>\tWe've been doing that for ... well, pretty regularly I guess that's 17 years now. Here's a picture that five years ago I was in Singapore giving a demonstration in front of a bunch of people and working with a system that was in Cupertino. Supporting that system over the networks, and I was working quite well to show them. Then I called up my buddy Dwayne Stone who lives in Washington D.C. area, and pretty soon we were connected. That's Dwayne Stone's screen projected for all to see. Dwayne Stone's voice was coming out giving them a lecture there. Then he shifted the controls to me, and I was doing that there. Then we say, \"Dwayne, what time is it?\" It was exactly 12 hours difference in time between Singapore and Washington D.C. It was very effective.</div><br><div>\tHere's something that for years that seemed to me was bound to come about that sort of thing. There's nothing hard about the engineering, it's the inter-operability coordination to do it. Because to let that kind of sharing go on, and the executives that we keep worrying about having to learn too much. Say, \"Well, look, you can have staff that are trained that can be like your chauffeur, etc,\" and this is something to do. In fact, in a heavy construction world, if some executive had to move around out through the jobs, and they said a helicopter be just the thing for him. Oh, but he's too busy to learn how to use a helicopter, and if the company then said, \"Oh, we aren't going to buy helicopter for him.\" You'd think that they were crazy because you have a helicopter pilot that's at his service. That same concept ought to be there.</div><br><div>\tThese ways of looking at what's happening in the system are important. This just summarizes the kind of thing we were looking for. The evolutionary freedom and the different classes of users having different classes of workstations and terminals through which they could work were just very, very important concepts. Each of those being able to evolve, and the servers out there being able to evolve flexibly too. So that was the pursuit of support of the evolution with the concept that there was a great deal of value going to be derived from all of this is what pursued us. In the AUGMENT world, we now have a little package that runs in the PC that emulates the highest class virtual terminal that the old system still has, and runs like ... The PC can work and support over network. Then this is just another [feeling 00:28:55] of the picture there of this unified environment. You walk through your local work place and there's many other things to talk about. Here, reach through, and the integration of what conceptually the user feels like when he's in there.</div><br><div>\tLet's jump back to the kind of concepts that in 62 were in that paper that I produced at that point. I was just thinking I want ... I had decided I want to augment people. I have the image that there's a great deal of value and change. I didn't know how to prove it, it just wasn't intuitive and incidentally the intuitive certainty has just increased year by year by year. There's a great deal of value to pursue and we've just scratched the surface. As an engineer I finally said, \"Well, let's see. Where you're starting.?\" Well, you're starting with humans and these are the basic capabilities in the knowledge work arena that I pictured humans having.</div><br><div>\tYou got mortal capabilities, you can grab, and reach, and turn, and twist, and actuate. You got sensory and perceptual machinery that lets you see, and understand, and perceive things. You got a lot of mental machinery that's got some [nice 00:30:09] and cognitive capabilities, and some of it is conscious and all. A bare human being just can't cope with outside world, so what's added? What's added is something I call an augmentation system, and these zones are what's added to the sort of naked-born human being. We all assume there's lots of teaching and learning that's going on, and a lot of unconscious conditioning that goes on to make you fit for the world. A lot of skills in your mortal and perceptual world that you, a lot of times aren't as clear about, but they're there. It's just a lot of skills that we don't appreciate until you watch little children trying to achieve the basic skills.</div><br><div>\tThen out here is whole zone of things that your culture hands you as well, that equip you for coping with the world. If you lump all those together and call it an augmentation system, that's what augments the basic human being, then the challenge is what can we do to keep on developing, evolving that augmentation system? How far can we go towards achieving significantly more capability? Well, our first step was trying to categorize a whole bunch of those augmentation system components. [Some 00:31:21] pretty soon I realize why it comes into some pretty simple parts. A very important thing for me was to say, well, let technology offer us a whole bunch of things that in a knowledge workshop, [from a 00:31:34] knowledge work are these kind of aspects your technology is providing. But there are all these other things that we sort of have taken for granted, but that the society builds and provides for us, and we have to develop skills and knowledge. You have to provide some training, and so it's a very important sort of thing.</div><br><div>\tI said, \"All right, a human system, tool system dichotomy,\" and lo and behold, we've got something pretty radical coming on over here, so what are we going to do about it? Well, next step is to say, \"Uh, almost any capability a human has, that he starts with here, is a composite of functional capability and support he gets from these, plus what he's learned [inside of 00:32:15] here.\" It's all composite, and so with more thinking at such you say, \"Well, it's a very important system, how much gain can we have?\" Well, the next step is to realize [while 00:32:27] that most of the capabilities you have, essentially all of them are built upon each other in a hierarchy. Then I did lots of thinking about this, and you get to realizing that hierarchy capabilities, the impact of something coming in over here that quantitatively speaking, just surpasses in its scale of changed capability, any introduction we ever had before.</div><br><div>\tThe speed, the detail, the color, the communication, the flexibility and portrayals etc, just tremendous. What's going to happen over here is almost every capability level here is probably going to find some way fairly directly to get impacted by this technology that's going over here. You say, \"That's great, we can automate the hell out of what's over here.\" Well, unfortunately that was the first image that people in the mid seventies [ofstuff 00:33:22] took on, and it just swamped out the concept of augmenting. It's taking a long time and it's about time for people to start realizing the concurrent changes that need to go on over here, to find out how you do harness what's [bringing 00:33:36] out here. As you guys within your operability get the functional capability, smoothly coordinate and integrate it so that the power of this is really available through out here, who's going to be working to get the organizations moving? To start exploring and prospecting, and doing invention out there, this side of it?</div><br><div>\tThen what's very, very important is for that co-evolution to take place, and not for one side or the other to start moving and dictating. So that co-evolution is just so strong in there, and so [that 00:34:05] ... A big part of why the architecture was pushed towards supporting the evolution is because that's one important thing to do so the whole organization ... This model works for an organization and an individual by the way. It's important for the evolutionary capability be freed up and the architectural, and the inter-operability issue is just extremely critical. It's a real pleasure for me to get your attention for a while to say, please, you guys are going to have a big impact in here. Whether you're from vendors providing that, or you're user organizations that are looking to this, it's time for both of you to start [feeling 00:34:46] that this is co-evolutionary, and time really to wake up, wake up to use your organizations and say you have to play a much more dynamic part in this process.</div><br><div>\tThat's one reason I left McDonald Douglas this spring to go to Stanford to try to set up a neutral territory, a thing called Bootstrap, and if we get there in the next 15 minutes to through the rest of this stuff, the picture of that process, but ... I really feel that it's ... that that's what we have to get users and vendors poking, and get user organizations in particular really oriented about what they can and should do to start the evolution. One picture that affects people is well, how much gain is there? This character Engelbart that is, as Dan was saying, people said, \"Well, he's crazy,\" and I do mind in a way. It's kind of lonesome being crazy, but it's sort of ... Some way this has been welded into my head for so long I can't shake it or drop it. Even if pursuit of it continually is not very sensible by career development, [it seems 00:36:02].</div><br><div>\tAnyway, here's the way I've looked at it continuously and it's just trying to share [with 00:36:09] you an analogy. I'm not going to read it, I can't see it well enough to read it, but it's ... If you analogy that a human organization is like a biological organism, and then you just watch. Pick a few different representative organizations and look at them and say, \"If that were an organism how would I characterize it? How smart is it? How quick are its reflexes? How much does it seem to know what's going on? How quickly can it adapt to something changing or new, etc? What kind of a look-ahead picture ... How far ahead does its headlights, or its eyes see in time? If it's careening down to through [the 00:36:54] time trail, and the trail gets rougher and rougher, and it's going faster and faster, is it got enough control, and good enough headlights, and good enough vision to be able to see and avoid, and control it?</div><br><div>\tWell, the world is moving faster and faster through a rougher and rougher world, and our organizations are very, very poor as far as that sort of time travel through problem space as a mobile vehicle. To me it's very important, so okay if that's the sense you have of an organization ... [He 00:37:30] says, \"Well, organism-wise we've just had a mutation occur very, very suddenly and recently, as far as evolutionary time goes, of this new nervous system technology that has this marvelous speed, accuracy, capability etc, that just far transcends any other thing our organization ever had to work inside it as a nervous system.\" So you're saying, \"Wow, let's do something about that.\"</div><br><div>\tOne of the things they can do is to, say, plug it in to replace the nervous system we did have with our old organs etc, and, \"Wow, we've done our job.\" That's like automating your old functions, and [he 00:38:15] says, \"No, wait a minute. There gotta be more than that. What about the rest of the organism?\" He says, \"Really, isn't it that the rest of the organism should be released and start its evolution so that it can learn how to take advantage of that new organs, new kind of functionality, new kinds of relationships and coordination between them.? New perception and sensory things out there, new [mortal 00:38:39] things for the organism?\" There really is, to my mind, a gigantic evolution that's going to be done, and with our organizations capability it can be very, very much enhanced.</div><br><div>\tYou say, \"Well, what if your organization you can't sell that the guys?\" You believe it but you can't sell it. Well, some organizations are going to take an evolutionary path that slowly pulls ahead, and if the potential is very high for increase, and somebody gets 6% of that, and somebody else goes after and finds 7%, they're gradually going to pull ahead. If somebody finds a way to get 20% of that potential, they're going to be miles ahead, and if somebody each has the chance and learns how with a strategy to get 50%, they'll just start owning the world. Okay, this is sort of the kind of picture I've got, and I feel like it's just going to start a separation process, just like sort of the speed of diffusion of different chemicals through some media, starts separating them. Pretty soon after a few hours you'll see one twice as far ahead as the other. Where [there's 00:39:46] very small difference in their velocity.</div><br><div>\tI can't remember what was on that slide, and I can't see it. All right, so anyway this way we might have a chance to getting through. The idea for an individual of domains, that there are a lot of different kind of domains where you do different kind of work. The basic question comes up is, what needs to be the interoperability between domains of this kind? If somebody draws them like that and says, \"Oh, every one of those needs to be inter-operable with every other,\" and [you says 00:40:37], \"Oh no, wait a minute. I can pick line X out of that and you can't prove to me that that's got a lot much value.\" I say, \"Yeah that's right,\" but the thing you start doing is start taking away some of those and saying, \"Well, how much money are you saving? And then how sure are you that you're not going to need it?\" If pretty soon you just sort of give up, you just say, \"Well, boy that's right. There isn't any [operative 00:41:02] way as things evolve for me to say that I'm not going to find new methodologies, and ways of working, and conventions that I won't find value in the interoperability of any of those domains.\"</div><br><div>\tThat's a very, very important kind of interoperability thing moved on up from the technology you're usually concerned with on into the humans world, at work. In the end that's what the other interoperability is supposed to serve, isn't it? One of the things about humans interoperability in their domains is the document just supports very, very much, and the files [you own 00:41:43]. This was an early, early concept of saying, \"All right, to be inter-operable in some meaningful way I need email,\" and we started out with a very nice email system in 1970, and sharing files with among our own domains, and among each others. Then the system we called the journal which is essentially like a library that any kind of file you submit to the journal gets taken in and cataloged, and held forever. Was given an identifier number that's always good, so you come back to that journal later and says, \"Give me item 2426,\" and you get it back. It's always there.</div><br><div>\tThen also the control of your external documents, and for that to be cataloged also is very important. This is a just a basic sort of thing about supporting interoperability in that knowledge workshop. Then if you add the fact that you have object level address ability inside those files, and that that supports cross reference linkages so that you can interconnect all of that. For instance, I can send you a message and say, \"Hey Fred, you got to look at, and here's a link pointing off some place. It seems to conflict what you said last week,\" another thing going off there. Both you guys seem to be way off from the requirements, another link. One sentence with three links and the email give you, ties things things together. That is an example, it is just very basic to me in about the way it must be done.</div><br><div>\tWith the journal thing in there like that, when you go on record and have that sort of recorded dialog about things, it's just increases the sort of interoperability of among people. Which after sort of [adds 00:43:31] the time domain of interoperability too. I need to be interoperable with myself, last week. A project in the design phase has to be interoperable back to specification or requirements, and in manufacturing interoperable between them and design, across time and space. It's a very, very important thing to consider.</div><br><div>\tThen you get two domains, two compound domains like two people, and you says, \"I need to be interoperable between those.\" This just raises the level of challenge above standards [in the like 00:44:11], and it's just not going to come about if these guys are using, I better not use commercial trade names, but they're using some sort of [futy 00:44:20] system, and these guy is using some kind of big blue system. You know that they're using different vernacular about what things are going on. The structure of the files, the [have 00:44:37] no concept of address-ability, so I can send you a message, I can point back to something I generated before. You just know that that's not going to be inter-operable with the kind of capability the potential promises, so that organization's going to grow how fast if that's what they provide for you. [You 00:44:55] say, \"All right, that can't work.\"</div><br><div>\tYou step on a little bit and you look at ... that's I think the aerospace one, is that right? Anyway, yeah, manufacturing, so you look at the major functional areas in there that within themselves have to provide interoperability between their individuals as well as between all of these different functions. Again you can say, \"Oh, some of those lines I don't think I'm going to need to really depend upon.\" But you just say, \"Well, what does it cost once you get passed a certain point?\" That interoperability emblem is very much ... levels of that goes on. We'll show you a little bit more of that in fact, you [said 00:45:36], \"Well, here's a big aircraft project. The advanced tactical fighter, and I don't think the [Northrep 00:45:46] was going to be the supreme in one of the [three 00:45:50] teams that's aiming for that thing.\" They're going to have 2000/3000 people working in there. When they get going they'd have to have these multiple tiers of suppliers that add up to be maybe 7000 companies.</div><br><div>\tYou say, \"Look at all those domains.\" Each of those suppliers has a domain and if I can't send you a contract that sites ... I mean if I can send you a document that says, \"Here's a contract,\" and it's got links pointing off to the relevant specifications, and requirements, and standards. You can follow those no matter where they're held and who's generated them, then it's very tidy and nailed down, and the response goes [like that 00:46:31]. Every place you look at can ... If you can send somebody something with links, and if there are common things about the structure so that I can say, \"This link follows to a certain point and shows a certain view,\" as you saw mine over there. You say, \"The payoff would just be immense.\" We try to just look at a domain like that and say, \"How many millions of dollars a year would you save?\" Somebody says, \"200, 500 million?\" Well, I don't know, it's a lot. It would mean a tremendous amount to the vitality of that company.</div><br><div>\tYou've got McDonnel Douglas is going to be a junior partner, and they have to team together, and it's been forced on [it 00:47:13], so they got all the same problems within there of supporting in that. When they team in together, as two big organizations got to team, what's that going to be like? Where they got all that sort of conventions inside in their environment, and they're going to overlap like this with a lot of collaboration in there, plus all kinds of mix in there. [He 00:47:36] says, \"Wow, that's the governments forcing them to do that for very reasonable, logical things.\" The complexity of managing in that is just out of this world, and the people that are trying to get ready to plan and manage that program either they just don't know about any existing supporting system for managing that they feel can do the job.</div><br><div>\tWell, then somebody starts showing them the creaky old augment system, and look how you can do the whole work break down structure hierarchically. How you can jump off from links to things. How the journal makes this record of dialog. How you can keep project status. How you can do this, and this, and this, and they look at that and it's just [inaudible 00:48:13]. That would be fabulous. We don't know anything that could do it that well, so both those companies now are starting working on requirement statement, and as a matter of fact they're seriously thinking about putting some deck twenties in their computer rooms, for a while, to get started using AUGMENT. It's ludicrous, but then they're saying, and they want to hustle about how can they get the world to provide them with some thing that's as good, and upward compatible, etc? They're actually going through that process now.</div><br><div>\tYou look at the whole aerospace industry and you realize there's so much overlap between customers and suppliers, that no one of these clusters of industrial teams can go it alone. You just begin to realize there are just some immense headway still in interoperability that's going to be required. Well, conceptually ... It's not 10:00. Since I can't charge Dan and you guys the 15 minutes that we were delayed, or something like that, so I'll just go through it very fast. I wish I could just make a skip to the punch lines at the end.</div><br><div>\tAnyway, here's some things about the you think about it. Humans when they're thinking about knowledge work, they start out with this beautiful capability of handling symbols, and relationships in their mind. They may not be aware of it at the outset, but after a while culturally they start giving labels, and start developing a language, and start realizing these concepts can be given nouns, and verbs. The relationships between them can actually be put there as syntactic relationships, etc, and you get a language. It's a fabulous move towards augmenting the human. A little bit further [now 00:50:18], this is when I tried to externalize that. I would like to make a map of that internal structure outside to work on, and linear paper is just a very feeble map. It loses lots of the dimensionality.</div><br><div>\tThe computer can hold a whole bunch, so why not start trying to learn about a structure of our files so that they represent better, and better mapping of what's in the conceptual structure of our understanding or an argument that I have. Other aspects of like saying, the span of your conceptual grasp at any one time isn't very great. In fact it's really kind of puny, but you got this marvelous capability of being able to zoom in very, very rapidly. Just travel instantly to some conceptual domain, insert yourself at the right kind of level of conceptual working and deal with it. If it weren't for that, if you didn't have that jumping, very fast jumping capability and zooming, and providing the view that you needed for your own contemplation. It would just be pitifully inadequate as a way to do any kind of thinking or working. We try to emulate that sort of thing, and that's how the hypertext world came, and I really don't have the time to go through that, but all your conceptual structuring in here, that position for jumping, that viewing was very important, and sharing the screens were very important.</div><br><div>\tThis is how that you actually built a system, and you get back to all this so that how you can move around in those documents are being structured like that, make a very, very important thing. This is just ways of viewing the same document very quickly at different levels, in different degrees from the same point, and I won't even stop with the rest. You can go through it that fast if you want to. One of the properties underneath we happened to do way back was add the date, and time, and the identifier of the last person that changed that object in the file. You can still go looking at source code, and some of our source code in this big AUGMENT system, we changed and got this file structure going in 1970s. Some places there's code [we're 00:52:40] identifying with people going way, way, way back. Jon Postel is here, I saw him like that, so his [ident 00:52:47] is probably in there at some places.</div><br><div>\tI just can't get ... I can't get through the rest of the material in any kind of sensible way, so if you'll excuse me I'll just blitz through and get at a couple of highlights. It's like saying, the picture of a community of people working on a shared area as we were talking about, and pretty soon you realize there's a lot of dialog and this is just a cycle of activity that records grow, and people are building and commenting, and arguing about the records. Their intelligence collections about the outside world, all that's being organized. The groups knowledge product that's steadily evolving, I just gave it a generic name I called it a hand book. Then I said, \"All right,\" the handbook and this cycle of evolution constantly day by day. It's what generates in the end the design, or the plan of whatever it is that's [the 00:53:56] community of projects resolves. You say, \"All right,\" to provide that sort of function for communities and projects would be very, very important.</div><br><div>\tThe idea of a Bootstrap is saying, \"All right, let's go after that early, [that would 00:54:10] do a lot value to all kinds of projects,\"  and if you start employing it within an organization above the evolution of what's going on there. It would be very, very valuable, so if we say, here's an organization and its augmentation system. Let's make an explicit project to say we're going to start improving that augmentation system, and say, \"All right.\" Some organizational unit with a human and tool system and I'm setting up an [ASEP 00:54:41], an augmentation system improvement project. In this Bootstrapping sense I just come to say to organizations, \"Look, why don't you start something like that?\" Then what would be really valuable there, there's a lot of these games we're trying to introduce that way. If you invest in this kind of bootstrap handbook cycle capability, that will have a lot of value in here. It will also just do tremendously if you organize your ASEPs in a community that's supported even more better like that. The idea of hierarchies, of communities in a bootstrapping investment among organizations that can lead to consortium, sort of what's just very, very quickly behind the bootstrapping thing.</div><br><div>\tWe're trying to get some user organizations and vendors starting interested, so we're actually holding a little three days seminar. Tiny, tiny seminar by comparison to this in three weeks. Dan arranged that in the registration kit there'd be little fliers that described that, so if a very, very small percentage of your organizations are interested enough, look us up. This is ... Just to finish, this is if whenever we're trying to buy all this technology, this is a kind of thing that keeps me in mind that you're talking about humans working with their knowledge work. This is the way I feel about it. It's stuff that you've got to maneuver and manipulate, and shape up, and it isn't anything like a nice organized database of something. It's like arguments, questions, everything else that's going on and trying to support that, but that's the art of getting things done.</div><br><div>\tI'll say, \"Okay, take that picture,\" and the next one is to say, \"Ah, yes technology really probably can lift this to some new heights, in a sense.\" Okay, that's what I was trying to give you a picture about, what it's all about. With that I'm done. Only five minutes late.</div><br><div>David Brandon:\tWell, I'm just going to say thank you Doug. I mean, it's marvelous. Hey Doug, Your wired man, give me ... All right, so thank you very much folks and off to your breaks, and then onto the beginning of the technical sessions.</div>",

        "full": "<div>Jim:\tHI. I\u2019m Jim Norton and I\u2019m going to show you an application using the AUGMENT system. That application is going to have to do with handbooks, special kind of augmented hyperdocument system to help people keep track of projects and reference materials.</div><br><div>\tBefore we start into the screen probably ought to take a brief look at the keyboard and the special devices that I\u2019m using here. In my left hand I\u2019m using a 5 finger keyset in which I can using chords type characters that I could otherwise type at the keyboard. In my right hand I am using a mouse pointing device. The combination of inputting commands at the keyset and pointing with the mouse is actually a little faster than switching between the keyboard and the mouse, so the keyset will be helping me through this.</div><br><div>\tNow, we should look at the screen from here on, I think. I\u2019m much more comfortable looking at that. This demonstration is about the augment reference handbook, which is a dynamic hyperdocument. We\u2019ll talk more about hyperdocuments as we go along. We\u2019re using a computer system in St. Louis, Missouri connected to that system by a Tymnet connection. In the screen here, at the top of the screen, are some system feedback information, a command line, the base editing system and some special view indicators to show what kind of a view we have at the moment.</div><br><div>\tI want to activate a command that will split our screen into several windows. These are some topics that I\u2019d like to cover. We\u2019ll cover as many as we can in the time that we have here. The information environment that the AUGMENT system supports, I\u2019m going to talk about where it is, what it is, and get some idea about how to access it.</div><br><div>\tThe AUGMENT system supports some computerized libraries called \u201cjournal libraries.\u201d There are many different libraries depending on which organization is supporting them. There\u2019s an augment library, and augmentation system\u2019s division, library and others. There\u2019s information in those various libraries that people want to tie together. Then there\u2019s also operational information; user guides, program documentation, things of that nature, and of course there\u2019s a lot of personal information in an AUGMENT system.</div><br><div>\tYou can see this last view is going into the bottom window. What kind of information are we talking about here? I\u2019m not going to read you the list, but it includes visions, plans, reports, proposals, dialogue, intelligence, indexes, catalogs, all sorts of things. When people of an interest in a particular subject it really helps to have some tools that sort of organize that information for you in advance. This particular way of doing it is called a \u201chandbook system.\u201d There are several different kinds of handbooks that can be and will be developed; project or program handbook, that will tell everything about a project or a program, or reference handbook. These have certain things similar and common with the kind of handbooks people are used to usually in hard copy.</div><br><div>\tI\u2019d like to change the view here, maybe get rid of these windows, yes, talk about the elements of a handbook system. A handbook is really an organized set of paths to views of information in a database for in many different databases. It\u2019s those views and the collection of them that could be considered the augmented handbook. To be able to see those views the handbook system utilizes an overview file, which we\u2019ll look at briefly, hypertext links, view specifications, and special indexes, some catalogs, conventions, special analysis techniques, and special roles.</div><br><div>\tThis view that I brought is a view of the augment reference handbook, just the top level topics. Since this is a hierarchically structured document at the moment you\u2019re only seeing the top level. If a user is interested in an overview of the AUGMENT system itself, because that\u2019s what this handbook is about, then giving a simple command to open up that view shows that you can look into several different documents, other documents that talk about applications and features, mail system, suspense system design. [Inaudible 00:06:25] having the idea that you\u2019d like an overview in mind that\u2019s several different flavors. If we just pick one, say applications and features, the system is gone to the library and found the document that talks about augments application areas and then features.</div><br><div>\tIt's not worth going through this line by line at this point. I really just trying to show you how the handbook system can present information in various ways. One way that we\u2019ve just tried is to take a reference link off to some other part of this hyperdocument. There\u2019s another screen full of augment capabilities. Behind each one of those, of course, lies more information about each topic.</div><br><div>\tClearly you don\u2019t want to look at the commands each time. That\u2019s distracting. I can say that the one that just flashed across the top of the screen was, \u201cPlease jump back to the file we came from,\u201d which as you can see is the view we had of the overview file. Here\u2019s the view before, the highest level. Now, if we look at, let\u2019s say documentation, at this point I\u2019m showing you a little more information. On the second line of each of these little paragraphs are some augment hypertext links. This link at this point, I\u2019ve just marked it, it just changes the view specification at this place. This link under glossary takes you to a file in my directory named \u201cHB glossary\u201d and sets a particular view there.</div><br><div>\tLet\u2019s take a look at the user system. Jump to link, there are the topics. This outline view into an augment handbook simply lets the people that want to prepare this for you organize the various topics hierarchically with links off to various documents. Right now this is linked into about probably 2 million words of information. It\u2019s not completed because it\u2019s only been done recently. It probably would be pointing at 20 million words if it was complete.</div><br><div>\tAt this point I\u2019d like to see something on tools and features a little bit more. I\u2019m really interested in mail. I\u2019m just pointing at subjects that interest me and seeing what my choices are. If I want to have a perhaps a mail system overview, that\u2019s there. We could go on and on this way, but I think that gives that an organization outline overview file can point in related logical ways into a very large database.</div><br><div>\tThis handbook has been under development really only for this last year. Even though the augment work has gone on for 20 years, we finally got around to looking at it and organizing the information this way just recently. The overview file that we were just looking at really contains only a few of the links to other information, because the documents that are referenced there themselves reference many other documents.</div><br><div>\tThere are processes that keep a handbook up to date and managed. A recent run, the end of July, on the augment handbook counted and found something like 250 statements with external links, and 12 published papers. Something like that. Published 12 published reports; that\u2019s what it is. There are quite a few internal links just to make the handbook overview file easy to move around in.</div><br><div>\tSecondary links: I\u2019m selecting topics you can see from the upper window. The overview file really is only the tip of the iceberg. We won\u2019t go through all the numbers. The point is that the database is large and growing. I sort of stepped in a hole there, but we got out of it.</div><br><div>\tHandbook system has to have conventions so that people understand as they come to use it how it works, and as people come to maintain it, how it\u2019s built. If one is interested in how the drafts of new handbooks are managed this document tells you how I did it, and how to do it; file structure, entering information, when people come into the handbook, how that should be, statement names in augment, how they\u2019re treated, links and all the conventions for treating those things are recorded and can be made clear to handbook developers.</div><br><div>\tJust as an example, link delimiters are set in this environment to be right and left angle brackets, and link addressing is handled. If I go back up to a higher level as you can see in the guide to developing these handbooks information on indexes, catalogs, special analysis, special tools, all sorts of things like that.</div><br><div>\tNow, it\u2019s worth having some special tools available to handbook developers and maintainers, so that as they update catalogs and indexes and make views they really have very simple commands, macros in our cases, to index links or topics of the overview file, or further on down to see external links in their context, or to see questions. There\u2019s a set of tools, we certainly won\u2019t go through them all here, that organize those things. One of the tools makes an index of topics in the overview file. This is before you get to indexes of topics in whole journal libraries. Those are similar but different things.</div><br><div>\tThis file sorted alphabetically shows the lead in text from the handbooks overview file and the links at those locations. Maybe go down a little further in here. Mailboxes, discovering [inaudible 00:14:50] McDonald Douglas, that\u2019s where this was originally built, taking that link takes you to a file that gives you information on that topic. It goes on and on here of course. We go back to the topic index. Not quite sure what we have there. Good.  The screen is a little funny for the moment, but we\u2019ll recover from that. There are other indexes; an index that shows where all the links are basically sorted by link.</div><br><div>\tI want to take a different [tact 00:16:09]. A different kind of a handbook would be a program or project state handbook. We were looking at the augment reference handbook, but that has a different orientation and different set of topics. This is a list of topics that might appear in a program state handbook. It gets more into organization, and deliverables, and baselines, status reports, intelligence. If we open up the view just a little bit, you can see that under organization there are quite a few things you want to know about organization. Past those things there are links to the real information.</div><br><div>\tI\u2019m going to return to the augment reference context, and bring in something that's quite different, and that\u2019s dialogue. It\u2019s one thing to have a handbook that lists things of interest to a project, or a reference guide, but it\u2019s another thing to have information in an open dialogue in libraries, maybe messages, messages that have been deemed by the authors to be public enough so they appear here. We\u2019ll call that \u201cdialogue.\u201d In the augment journal dialogue, going back to 1984 and earlier has been cataloged and indexed and links to those catalogs appear here. For just 1990 to date, the link I just took takes you to a numerical sorted catalog.</div><br><div>\tAt the top, of course, there are links to last year. We haven\u2019t got to next year yet, to a keyword index for the same period, and to some special studies of the occurrence of words. We just look at one of these, you can see that on lower levels, lower lines, past the subject, is the author, when it was sent, this was last January 14, and where it is. In each one of these links anywhere they appear can be taken and you get what they point at.</div><br><div>\tIf we stay in this catalog and decide, \u201cNope, we\u2019re interested in key words,\u201d then we can take a link to a keyword index for the same time period. Maybe we\u2019re interested in an article about Japan. Just put in that word. Yup, there it is; the Japan that can say no. What the heck is that about? We\u2019ll just take a little look at it. This was May of \u201990. Introduction. You notice the view that you\u2019ve brought into this file with is really just a couple of levels of it, maybe one line out of each. We can change that so that we see everything.</div><br><div>\tThis article about the Japan that can say no, oh I see, looks like it\u2019s something that stirred up a lot of interest. Clearly we don\u2019t want to go through it here. I see. Yup, Mr. [inaudible 00:20:11]; interesting. We\u2019ll read that another time.</div><br><div>\tWe go back to the keyword index we came from, we might see if there\u2019s anything else about Japan here. There is a message. This is just the start of a trail of dialogue that one can follow in about any direction one wants to. We\u2019ll try one more. Some more journal catalogs, but rather than to go follow the links and really look into the data and just see which libraries are organized. ASD, the augmentation systems division, the old office automation division, OAD, teaming and collaboration, CAD/CAM cals McDonald Douglas organization, cals. There\u2019s quite a few libraries. The documents in those are all cataloged and indexed.</div><br><div>\tThe idea of keeping up on the dialogue on all sorts of topics that relate to a particular product or system like augment,  or to a particular program, or project the dialogue becomes much easier to use and make use of when you have indexes that\u2019ll let you look at them this way. There\u2019s another way of looking into this, of course, and that would be into papers, reports listings. Might just look at that for a moment. Okay, papers, reports having to do with augment, of course, in this case. What about papers? Notice each time I give a command to open up a little level I see a little bit more.</div><br><div>\tPaper one: Special considerations of the individual as a user generator and retriever of information. 1960 something. It\u2019s way back there. Interestingly enough, the message is bigger, but essentially the same in 1990. Let\u2019s see. See if we can go to another topic.</div><br><div>\tI\u2019d like to end the talk about handbook. Just this view. The handbook in this definition and in this context is a collection of views, we were seeing all sorts of views either of organizing files like this overview file, or keyword, or links, or topics\u2019 indexes, or author indexes. There are some I didn\u2019t have time to show. Files from the operations and administration people, special analyses. Since this handbook is on the topic of augment, it can be part of or referenced by any other handbook for any other kind of activity. As more and more handbooks get built with this kind of  an approach, and in newer hyperdocument systems that have come on to replace the AUGMENT system, as those handbooks get developed and start to live, so many of them will relate to each other and make use of the work that other people have done.</div><br><div>\tAt this point I\u2019d like to come back and look you directly in the eye and say thank you for your time. That\u2019s as much about the handbook system supported by augment that I can tell you this afternoon. Thank you.</div><br><div></div>",

        "full": "<div>Speaker 1:\tI'd like to welcome you all and in particular welcome Dr. Douglas Engelbart to the Writer Distinguished Lecture Series. Many of you and most of you have been influenced by the remarkable contributions Dr. Engelbart has made. The ubiquitous mouse, windows on computer screens, hypertext and the very concept of interactive computer machinery. All of these, remarkable as they seem, are only a manifestation of a more fundamental idea that's fueled his inventiveness. That is that the augmentation, expansion and utilization of individual and collaborative efforts in order to handle ever more complex human problems can be aided through the use of computer technology.</div><br><div>\tHe's a pioneer and he's a visionary and we are pleased and privileged to have him share that vision with us today. At the end of the talk, by the way, we have a sign up sheet at the back and he has left a copy of his paper from which he will take some of his comments today. We'll make copies of those available to those of you who are interested. Dr. Engelbart.</div><br><div>Douglas:\tWell thank you. I guess that has to get switched off. I think I like what he says better than what I'm going to say.</div><br><div>\tI guess I may as well just pitch in. If I get started doing too much preliminary reminiscing, then we don't get at the gist of my design for you.</div><br><div>\tOne thing, I'm talking about organizational change and evolution and that's been my pursuit for many years and what has happened quite recently that I'll just introduce a wave to you is the sort of emergence of a specific concept of really introducing higher quality into the organizational operations and start out with the products' mounts getting more expansive. Out in the commercial world, the Department of Commerce set up three years ago this plan for a National Quality Award. They named it after deceased Secretary of Commerce Baldridge, so they call it the Baldridge Award. In October last year a special issue of Electronic Business was devoted just to that quality with a lot of very interesting articles about the, this is an industrial, the industrial organizations that have taken onto this. In 1978 or 88, Motorola won the first prize and last year Xerox won it. More and more I'm hearing- I visited IBM two or three months ago and their president has said, \"We are going after that award.\" There's a whole corporate pursuit. Kodak I find out is also and Deck, yes, we're really going to get up for this. There's also strong move for this in the government.</div><br><div>\tWhat I'm talking about now in general is a strategy that's been evolving with me for decades literally that was based upon the thing that organizations need to be a lot capable and here's the strategy for doing it, because it's very complex, etc. I'm going to walk you through some of the strategic concepts and a little bit of the specifics and in the end, sort of say well then, within organizations this is the way I would choose to, or suggest. Man machine. I would suggest the way in which we go after this pursuit. Let's start out with, first, how does thing crack?</div><br><div>\tThis is a statement that actually triggered me into all of this. It was 39 years ago, almost some time to the week or the month or something like that that this dawned on me. I was trying to pick someway to reorient my career because I'd realized that here I was in my mid-20s and I had a steady job and I was going to get married and all my goals were now taken care of and to have no more goals than that made me feel kind of embarrassed. Then what I did was overdid it about picking up a goal that's sort of been the bane of my life ever since. The realization that this is the kind of thing that was happening, even then. That all our problems seemed to be getting more complex and more and more they're getting urgent. It's increasingly difficult to cope with them as they get complex and in any degree of complexity it's increasingly difficult to cope if they get more urgent. The product of those two really means a measure of difficulty for coping and in 1951 I was saying, \"My golly, that's exceeded human capability to cope. If we can't cope, we're just sliding downhill faster and faster into more complex thing and we're going to crash sometime. Boy if I could do something about that.\"</div><br><div>\tI got this crazy picture about interacting with computers and sitting at displays and working. You know what, the nearest computer then was someplace I guess with the whirlwind and maybe something like that. I'm sort of embarrassed by it. Anyway, that's what launched me.</div><br><div>\tI had this driving picture about what could happen that seems to exceed what most people were thinking about what could happen. This is sort of one way to think about it for me. Compare human organization to a crude biological organism. The way our organizations are now. Slow responses, poor sight, lousy perception, ponderously clumsy, doesn't understand its own workings, and on and on. You get the idea. It's not the organization you work for, but it's some of the others that you've seen.</div><br><div>\tAll right. Then along in that world of slow evolution, etc, a slow mutation produces a new nervous system, technology if you will. Hugely better in all dimensions, sensing, remembering, associating, perceiving, reasoning, coordination. This is what's happened in our technological world. In the parallel you'd say, \"So that something biological happened and came up. So does that organism just replace its old nervous system, automate it and then that's where its future stays?\" No. Out in evolution of organic things you know it takes off from there because it begins to find out it can start having new organs that can interrelate. With new functions and new specialties. It sets about evolving the rest of its organizational structure and function to become a new, different and much more capable organism.</div><br><div>\tThat's what just dawned on me, this intuitive picture. My God, we get organizations that get really reflexive, quick, aware. They are much more aware, can ingest what happens around them and digest it and make it part of their scene, of what's going on. If they pick goals, they're much better coordinated at picking up and moving after it and changing and moving. Knowing what's going on. Much more efficient utilization of all the component capabilities it has. I said, \"You know what? Maybe.\"</div><br><div>\tThere are many other reinforcing sort of concepts about what the future organizations can become. That's what sort of drove me in some strange way. An image of so much change. All right, if this technology can support that, how do you go about it? I just said, \"Well, we're going to augment the human.\" The you have to have some sort of strategy. Let's start out by augmenting the intellectual work, I called it. By 1968 I read a book by Peter Drucker that talked about the emergence of the knowledge activity. Knowledge worker, knowledge work, knowledge organizations, knowledge industries. I said, \"Ah, that's a better term. Augmenting the knowledge work is a way to go after all of this.\"</div><br><div>\tThat's not the whole solution, but that's a good way to do it because if you can augment, increase significantly the ability to do tough knowledge work, that's the component of effort that's going to be involved critically in trying to do the rest of your improvement of that organism.</div><br><div>\tBy the late 50s I realized, you really needed an appropriate way to think about this. Nowadays they would call it a paradigm, but that hadn't been popularized at that time. I found a beautiful article by some gooks at Rand who were doing in their multidisciplinary work they've really begin to find out that you formulate some new program and it takes multiple disciplines and you try to bring in people from the different disciplines and they look at it and says, \"I don't see the object of going that. Our discipline's already doing that.\" Or something of that sort. I was experiencing exactly that same thing. Information retrieval people would tell me, \"I don't see that you're talking about anything more than information retrieval, and we're already doing that. Why are you off there waving this banner that's sounds so strange? Why don't you come here and do this hard work with us?\"</div><br><div>\tThey really being very irritated with me about it. Emergent AI group like that too said, \"Well, we're doing that. We're going to have these machines that are so smart that'll do that.\" I said, \"No, I'm interested in boosting the human's capability. I'd be very happy for the human and an AI module to work as a team, so I would say the sort of augmented team is what I want instead of the artificial intelligence, as an end goal.\" We didn't get along very well on that either, so I said, \"Well, I'll go off and make my own framework.\"</div><br><div>\tThat framework isn't generally understood as an issue when you open new pursuits. When you grow up in any given discipline, you absorb in your professional training, a framework like that and that's how you view it. When the paradigms shifts hit the fan, as the saying goes, you're trying to make plans and pictures about this future environment and you're firmly embedded in the old paradigm. If years later you went back and see how you wrote, described what it is you want to do, in terms of the then acceptable framework, it'd be embarrassing the way you just sort of didn't see a lot of the whole picture. Of course, I don't want to get so personal because you're experience with it is always watching the other people that don't get it about what you're proposing to do. It finally dawned on me that I was guilty of that same thing and then to a great relief, I found that I could just say that's a human capability that everybody has.</div><br><div>\tYou find out that this kind of framework is embedded in your culture and a lot of it you just absorb unknowingly as you grow up and that that kind of cultural framework is one of the things that gives us enough inertia and stability so that we don't gyrate all over the place and change but it is- The basic problem is that in accommodating change is coping with that inertia culturally.</div><br><div>\tInappropriate framework may lead to wasteful mistrials, widely ignored possibilities. In this for instance, this computer supported cooperative work issue about computers could be useful for cooperative work. Now it's getting to be an exciting thing with conferences, et cetera. It could have emerged, that's what I was aiming at for many years. Why did it take so long? Some basic cultural perception of what computers were for and what you could do with them.</div><br><div>\tNow we don't want to think that we suddenly get enlightened and that's going to be all over. That's going to be where this- any time the rate of change is above a certain rapidity, because there's a certain time constant to the adaptation culturally. As long as the rate of change stays up, we're always going to be floundering that way. Unless we find a way, instead of just depending on inheriting it, if we can start consciously cultivating that. That's one of the real challenges because the rate of change in our whole culture and society is really, really going faster than we know how to cope. I'd better go faster too, huh?</div><br><div>\tWhat I do, I started thinking like a nice little engineer about ... In the next slide or so, a basic conceptual model that really takes a long time to describe, but I just said, \"Look. You're trying to do something with a human and human organizations, but how does a human deal with the outside world?\" If you just take a bare human that's got some latent capability to develop perceptual skills and motor skills and sort of a mental machine there, some of who's activity you're conscious of, without training and everything, you're helpless.</div><br><div>\tSocieties had to develop a complex system of language, custom, tools, methods, so that the humans tiny grasp- All of this, the best they can do is grab something small or do a little bit of mental work. Very, very tiny little contributions. Somehow those tiny things could cope with large tasks and problems. It's in here. Your culture indoctrinates you to unconscious things, you learn a lot of conscious things you can do, the rest of it is out of control, of course. Then there are lots of things you've learned. Perceptual motor skills. Most of those things you all learned so that you can operate with a whole body of organizational and customs and artifacts in the outside world. These shaded areas, as they've developed, that's what augments that human so the human can cope. It's a very important thing and to me I realize, \"Oh. We ought to think of that as a system.\" It's that system which has a chance now to be improved effectively and I assumed that some academic discipline would be dealing with such a whole system, but no.</div><br><div>\tI called it an augmentation system and I dearly hope someday to see that that's, we start getting people who study that as a whole system who's architecture's very important. A little bit we'll show it. This was emerging about 1961 into something specific.</div><br><div>\tIt evolved to this and I don't have time to go into all the things that this does because this is sort of the fountainhead of all kinds of things that emerged and looking at it like that to say, \"All right, this whole bundle is what makes an individual or even it could portray for an organization, that you have these capabilities within the people and they have developed skills and knowledge through training in order to do that. What are they skilled and knowledged about? Well, all of what the technology offers and for here I'm including here the things for the knowledge work domain and not for all the physical activities you do. None of that. You've got certain media that you can deal with and all of these kinds of functions plus more and more that you can elicit from the base of capabilities that your technology offers. That is integrated into all of these things that human does.</div><br><div>\tI said, really you need to consider the fact that there really are these two co-operative systems and that all through the years without our sort of being aware of it, we would think about the inventions here in the history books and the history books don't tell you that much about the inventions here that went along concurrently, but it's terribly important to realize that co-evolution of those two things is the way it happened and the whole system over here is very very complex. Sociologists fight over it. Anthropologists say no, it's this. Psychologists say no, it's this. Heaven help you, the MBAs will say no it's and organizational thing. Anyway, there's a lot to that.</div><br><div>\tAs I looked at this and just- My God, here I am, an ex-engineer sitting off in the corner of the world, and trying to say I'm going to do something about that. It obviously needs some real strategy or framework if you're going to so something seriously. If you want to facilitate the evolution of that, then one of the things that came out of this by the mid, early 70s or something was the way the overall architecture of an organization's information support system ought to be. I was involved with the ARPA net from the time in 1967 it was said we're going to do it. I volunteered to develop and run the network operation center because that was really in line with the strategy I wanted to do. We really watched while all that was happening.</div><br><div>\tBy the early 70s I knew it was going to be a network. Obviously a network organization and that you really wanted to do a lot to support the continuing evolution of different classes of workers inside of that knowledge thing and their functionality and the skills as well as the evolution of the functionality you could provide inside the system. There are provisions we built and had running in the system we had going at SRI, Stanford Research Institute. It's funny, through all that time in the 60s when I was promoting and pushing that, so the interaction with ARPA and then [BB&N 00:18:42] and people at MIT and during those years some even from Lincoln Lab. I watched the birth of [miter 00:18:47] go on and all that. It's kind of a kick to come back in the midst of all that and I'm looking around for some of my old friends and I've realized that they've judiciously retired, I'm sure.</div><br><div>\tBecause I saddle myself with this thing even though I'm old enough to, I don't have the sense to quit. I've got this large unfinished agenda first. Maybe another twenty years to try to get it moving.</div><br><div>\tA lot of things, the architecture came out of that and then them saying there are a lot of dimensions over here that are going to surprise us because we didn't grow up thinking about it. It just isn't in our mind to be switching through the candidates to change over here, we just sort of accept them. There's going to be many many that we stumble on that start emerging and we'd better get ready for that. One of them, I thought well, fundamentally down here language is just such a marvelous, marvelous invention. What's going to happen to that? A good bit of all this knowledge work is just dealing with essentially our linguistics and our concepts. Oh yes, it's helping us externalize our concepts, Oh great, well then you can think ahead to think of the whizzy wig way of externalizing making paper and no, no, wait a minute. That's only using a part of what you can do here. Why think of paper? Once you get it in the machine you could structure  however you wanted to make a map of your concepts.</div><br><div>\tI started developing the idea of structured files and then this is, oh boy, and you can jump around inside of that so there comes the addressability and the links. You can mix all your different media in there. The whole thing, I decided, it'd be very important to start, very useful to start here with some new dimensions is what now is called hypertext and some things we did that are beyond that today because once you get it started, that can evolve. It's very hard to make the transition from flat to structured paginated things over to this hyperworld, so let's get started right away.</div><br><div>\tThat's what we started in our lab in the 60s. I'm going to run some video of what we did in 1968 at a computer conference. I risked an immense amount to use research money that the sponsors would have denied knowledge of if I'd failed and it'd become public that- In leasing some video lines, the thirty-some miles with one relay in it form SRI up to San Francisco. It was a big auditorium in the civic center that can hold two or three thousand people and a twenty foot screen and a great big video projector at the time that did a beautiful job. I was sitting off to the side here and we didn't have available easy modems then so we had to make our own to get, to put down there to the SRI. I was sitting there running a system and had a video monitor in front of me which I saw things and our display system was very complicated to have provisions for having twelve displays to work in our laboratory, we had electronic assemblies that would fill this whole area here like that with display generator driving little tiny direct displacement CRTs with video cameras looking at that with video amplifiers piping available to pipe the video out into our laboratory.</div><br><div>\tWe had all that video we could pick up and beam to San Francisco including camera views form down there and up in the stadium there was a camera screwed onto the side of the monitor that could catch me face on and another one overhead that could see my hands and in the back we had a booth fixed up where these four video signals, two from the laboratory and two from the podium, could be switched and faded in and out and mixed with what was projected. Off to the side we put a best quality monitor we could and a special camera to pick that up. Video recorders were only then only things that used tape this wide and were in studios, they weren't portable. Anyway, we had these movies for 90 minutes of that and four years ago there was a conference on the history of the personal work station. For that Xerox Palo Alto Research Center helped with their video facility that we converted those movies to video and then I pulled out a bunch of clips from that to make a short twenty minute thing that I'm going to run.</div><br><div>\tThere's two things. It sort of says, well this is where we were then and what we could do, but it's also the explanation I was giving to the audience then is almost exactly what I'd say now. It says, okay that's where we were and since then we've done as much as we could with a very very irregular source of support for what we're wanting to do. Let's run the video, all right?</div><br><div>Doug Video:\tI hope you'll go along with this rather unusual setting and the fact that I remain seated when I get introduced and the fact that I'm going to come to you mostly through this medium here for the rest of the show. I should tell you that I'm backed up by quite a staff of people between here and Menlo Park where Stanford Research is located some thirty miles south of here. If everyone just does our job well it will all go very interesting. The research program that I'm going to describe to you is quickly characterizable by saying if, in your office, you as an intellectual worker, were supplied with a computer display, backed up by a computer that was alive for you all day and was instantly responsive to every action you had, how much value could you derive from that?</div><br><div>\tThis basically characterizes what we've been pursuing for many years in what we call the Augmented Human Intellect Research Center at Stanford Research Institute.</div><br><div>\tLook what else we can do in here. I've got this file that's structured. If I want to see what's in there, I can walk down the hierarchy levels and see. There's another thing I can do. There's a route I've said I have here. Here, I'm afraid I'll need a different picture than view. So here's what I drew with the picture drawing capability. It's a slight map I start from work and here's a route I see to have to go to to pick up all the materials and that's my plan for getting home tonight. If I want to I can say, the library. What am I supposed to pick up there? I can just point to that and oh, I see, overdue books and all. There was a statement there with that name on it. Go back. What if I, what's am I supposed to pick up at the drugstore? Hmm. I see, interesting. All right? Market? Oh, I've already seen that, [inaudible 00:25:48] like that. Gee, that's too much.</div><br><div>\tAnyway, so we have this feature of structuring our material hierarchically. Being able to move around it very well. When we get a hierarchy, such as I can show you here now, I can do things if I want to, just say, I want to interchange produce and canned materials. Bingo. They're all numbered rightly if I care to look. Interchanging them very quickly. Cans are going to get interchanged with produce. They do it and all gets renumbered.</div><br><div>\tI've ways of studying over, making different views, moving around, going to specified points and modifying the structure. At the same time I've seen that I have a repertoire of different entities like character, knock off that character, replace a character, make that \"P\". I have entities of all sorts that I can say I want to do operations on and this basic structure that I can move over and study and get about very quickly. That is the essence now. That is the essence of the tool we have. There are a lot of details that I've left out for you.</div><br><div>\tNow I'd like to stop a minute and just make sure you understand that we're shifting from an illustrative material to the real working stuff, in case you wouldn't recognize it otherwise.</div><br><div>\tWe use this tool to do our daily work and it's- Our system has been built, this time sharing system, for about six months now, it's been working. In that time we've gone from it getting one console to getting about six working now with six more due, the rest this spring. This is our fourth computer on which we've had this kind of a system, so we've learned a lot about the user features we want and how to be fairly skillful. This next step about learning how when you're faced with having this in your office all day as I now do, very exciting sense, how do you put that to work for yourself? How do you organize your files? What kind of things do you do?</div><br><div>\tTo get going on this let's switch away from the tool we have her and talk about some of the general features of the program. Some of the ways it's built to get back a little later to the nature of our usage of it.</div><br><div>\tThat program involves about 17 people together with a special laboratory facilities we have. It's sponsored by government agencies exclusively. ARPA, NASA and RIDC now and in the past, AFOSR, NESD and these are the  people that first staked us many years ago.</div><br><div>\tIt's been a goal oriented pursuit for many years and I think that we can just go off and get a quick little picture I sketched to show. This is the staffing over the years from 1950 on and it's had a slightly bumpy history. During these years there was only one of us.</div><br><div>\tI can go back to where I was and say, let's continue on in this file. That link took me out to a different file, to a statement for that view and I jump back to this file where I was and now within this file I make a link to another to say the HIRC is pursuing these goals. Basic goal: improve the effectiveness with which individuals and organizations work at intellectual tasks. What does their effectiveness involve then? Better solutions, faster solutions, solutions to more complex problems, the better use of human capabilities. Really thinking about that.</div><br><div>\tA corollary goal is, besides improving the effectiveness, to develop a system oriented discipline for designing the means by which greater effectiveness is achieved. That's very important to us. The approach for this should result in the system oriented discipline.</div><br><div>\tLet me just show you how I constructed this file. You'll notice underneath there with that and that. There was just a link hidden here that went back to this view with a slightly different view parameters. To give you that view. All right there's another one hidden there. It says the general approach for us, empirical. We're pursuing this monstrous goal, monstrously difficult, to, by building and trying, empirically and we're approaching it evolutionary-wise because we feel that it's a whole system problem. You need to get a person in that environment working and looking at the many aspects of his working system that are involved in his effectiveness. That's many more things than just these computer aided tools and a large system like that, we need to do it evolutionary-wise because we can't be analytic enough about it at any one point to decide what best our next thing should be. We can only decide from here as well as we can analyze it, where we can invest our next resources to get the most return at an increase of the effectiveness of the system we have.</div><br><div>\tThis item down here is a term bootstrapping applied in a sort of loose sense. We're applying that to our approach. We're saying we need a research subject group to give them these tools, put them to work for them, study them and improve them. We'll do that by making ourselves be the subject groups and studying ourselves and making the tools so that they improve our ability to develop and study these kinds of systems and to produce in the end, this kind of system discipline.</div><br><div>\tIt's a struggle doing it that way, but it's beginning to pay off.</div><br><div>\tI've given you an overall picture about the program. That's out of the way and I can just move my marker down and say let's save that version. This tool in pursuing those goals, one of our principle tools is this computer aid system. Let's talk about it as a system. There's a link sequence to jump in there too. When we talk about NLS being the online system. A very general term. It's going to be NLS for many many years. An online system that evolved. Right now we consider it to be primarily an instrument, a vehicle, for helping humans to operate within the domain of complex information structures.</div><br><div>\tWhat do we mean by operate? Well, compose, study, modify is the place we started now. We know there are  many analytic things you could do, but we want to get around, study and modify. Further information about what does complex structure mean? We're talking about complex structure and emphasizing structure because we say, although the content represents your concepts, there's a structural relationship between that content entities that should represent the relationship between the concepts of human thought.</div><br><div>\tWe never can do that very well within your text, so inside the computer we can represent that quite well. In fact, we can represent information structures on the computer that would generally be far too complex for you to study directly. NLS serves as a tool to roam over that, navigate through a complex structure. Being able to find you way and be navigating, move about it rapidly and be able to see what you want to see at any given point. It's how we think of NLS as a tool.</div><br><div>\tThese are all very important concepts to us because these together, the bootstrapping, have told us where to start. We start by building a instrument that we can sit at and work during our day to organize the kind of working information we need as a task force developing systems. We need to write our specifications, our plans, our programs, our users guides, our documentation, our reports and even our proposals.</div><br><div>\tThis device over here is unique to us and we always have to justify and explain it. We'll do it in reverse order. We'll explain it first. It provides for you the one hand equivalent of what you can do with a keyboard. There are five keys and normally each finger sits on a key and depressing any one key at a time produces a character. Any two keys at a time also. In fact any combination of depressing, of which there are thirty one combinations.</div><br><div>\tIt will offer you a character. If I hit \"W\" it will say delete word. The arrow moves back and forth to give me feedback. My tracking spot changes, that gives me feedback. Now it tells me, since it's an arrow, that it's armed, I can do something. We get a lot of feedback. Let me restore a view like this to show you. This is more normally the way we work with feedback up here. Where here I'm shown ... it's not working. That's an echo register that normally gives you the last six characters that you used. It's not working. All right.</div><br><div>\tThe last six characters and left shifts continuously so you can look up any time and see what have I just struck and that's for a good feedback. Here are characters that show me the different viewing parameter, view specs. They get large at times at which I can add, hit single strokes that change those view parameters. Each of those means something to me and their being large at particular times tells me I can get very quick abbreviation for changing the view. I can say, all right, I'd like to go to produce, go to produce they get big. I'd like to say, one branch only and let me look just that low and I see it. I can say, I'd like to see one line only. I can see it. These ways I move around, the way I get feedback up here, the way I use both hands to coordinate to tell the computer what command and what short little rules I want. All carefully designed to go together to make the repertoire.</div><br><div>\tWe talk about the devices and now the nature of the dialogue and the kind of feedback we get from the computer for each of the discrete character strokes and actions that the user goes through when he's making, when he's executing a command. That system's really represented to a user by the repertoire of commands he has, by the function of each of those commands and by the controlled dialogue he has for each of them. They all together go in making a design and to do it well you have to be very careful about the nature of the functions in that repertoire and the natures of the way they're controlled.</div><br><div>\tWe've developed a very special language for talking with extreme precision about these controls. Both the command functions and the control dialogue for them. A little bit later when we tell you about the programming, Jeff [inaudible 00:38:01] will bring in some special examples to you of the languages we've used actually to program at high level these functions and the controlled feedback that we get, these controlled dialogues.</div><br><div>\tI'd like to link to Bill and I don't know what his terminal is right now. I have to ask for somebody to connect me to him audibly. Bill, will you come in through this intercom?</div><br><div>Bill Video:\tHello Doug.</div><br><div>Doug Video:\tHi. I need to know what terminal you're on, Bill.</div><br><div>Bill Video:\tThirteen.</div><br><div>Doug Video:\tOkay. I'd like to have him see my text. This special thing, if I label 13, will switch over so on his display he sees my text. I'll execute it. Sure enough it does, but what's that, running around? Well, if he's looking at my text, he'd like to have something to say about it. We put on a marker, a tracking spot, that he controls. He's sitting there in Menlo Park looking at this text and he can point to it, but we've carefully reserved for me the right to control and operate on this. My bug is more powerful than yours, but we can have an argument.</div><br><div>\tThat's what they call a bug fight.</div><br><div>\tIn case you haven't been listening, Bill, we've been going through lots of examples and setting up a collaboration here so that we can go on into information retrieval. We set up now audio coupling and now we're both looking at the same display and that'd be very handy to work. We can talk to each other and point. Maybe later I can hand you the chalk on this blackboard like saying hey, you control it. Let's stay this mode now and add another feature that hardware-wise is available through the kind of display we have. I'd like to see you while I'm working on it, so before I can do that, I'd have to set up my display in a certain way.</div><br><div>\tSet it up so that I see a [inaudible 00:40:00] like that that leaves a corner up there and I say, now computer, do the automatic switching that will bring in a camera, picture from the camera mounted on his console such as the camera mounted on mine is.</div><br><div>\tHi Bill. That's great. Now we're connected. Audio. You can see my work, you can point at it and I can see your face, we can talk. Let's do some collaborating. You're silent.</div><br><div>Bill Video:\tWhat do you want me to say?</div><br><div>Doug Video:\tThere's nobody here but a large audience, Bill.</div><br><div>Bill Video:\tAll right.</div><br><div>Doug Video:\tAll right.</div><br><div>\tLet's go talk about information retrieval. A lot of things I've been showing them has been jumping around and finding your way relating back to the portrayal I gave about NLS as an instrument on complex data structures. It shows them how we can get around and find things. I showed them the content analyzers to help locate things.</div><br><div>\tOkay. You know how to file, kind of classifying retrieval stuff. Why don't we switch to it.</div><br><div>Bill Video:\tBy the use of a hierarchy here, I mean, working down through the hierarchical structure of the file, making use of the categorization that's built into the file. This we've seen several times. Let's, as another example, to really make this clear. We've talked about the desire to get hard copy of a file. Wanting to get something printed out. There's quite a large system that takes care of making a file for hard copy. You're able to specify how you want the hard copy to look by giving various directives. One of the things you might want would be roman numeral page numbers.</div><br><div>\tLet's go off to a directive file and see what the directive is to get roman numeral page numbers. I'm into the file now. Here's the first level of the hierarchy. Let's open up page formatting. We want page numbering, so we open that up. We find, yes, here it is, roman numerals. We find out the directive, yep, your bug's right on it already Doug. Here's the directive we want.</div><br><div>\tWe've worked down quite a way into a hierarchy as you can see.</div><br><div>\tThis is quite a nice way to be able to quickly find what you're after.</div><br><div>Douglas:\tOkay.</div><br><div>\tWhich me is talking? From three different periods.</div><br><div>\tIt wasn't just outlining, a whole document, so any one of those lines that usually would appear can open up to be a whole paragraph and the clipping at level and the clipping of how many lines and all that, just were built in from the outset. Over the ensuing years that evolved to have a lot more functionality in it and more application domains and the architecture of it was generalized so that you could integrate lots of different functionality of sub-systems very flexibly. Mail systems and all that got integrated and ...</div><br><div>\tAll our source code is written in there and it was structured from the outset naturally because it's so easy to structure here, so that was even before it was publicly or generally interested in making structured programming. Very flexible ways to use links. Either explicit one pointing to places or implicit ones. Implicit ones are like a, like a pronoun is an implicit link. When I say, \"It was hot.\" The \"It\" you can, because of the syntax and the context you sort of implicitly go back and find that reference, the antecedent that it stood for.</div><br><div>\tWe could use a lot of that with appropriate conventions inside the computer files too. Since there's such as generous use of labeling, addressing and flexible navigating, your source code for instance, you see a procedure column and you're not quite sure what it does, you can just evoke a command that will follow this implicit trail. You say, I want to, jump name externals' what they use and it goes through that indexing arrangement that's set up and the next thing you're looking at is the source code for that procedure. When the printout would fill a shelf this big on AUGMENT now, it's a very large system.</div><br><div>\tAny piece of data like that is just that close. One quick link. I use that same thing in our integrated mail. Every mail item is given a label that's part of the identifier. Tells what mail group it's from, what's your personal identifier is and a five character code that sort of fixes it in time. That's sort of at the head of every branch of material there, that's a given message.</div><br><div>\tInternally we keep the hash code of all such labels and such so it's very easy to find, put which file in where. When I use the same kind of indexing thing. Whenever I see any mail item referenced by that head or label I can just say, jump name external, click and no matter it's on an archive basis from six months ago, I just go right to it.</div><br><div>\tA lot of very flexible ways that this is used and through the years it moved into more and more organizations. Mid 70s we started, we actually were running a for-charge service over the ARPA net to any organization that wanted to start exploring the use of this inside the organization. There were some very interesting applications of that, but they generally ran into the problem that the inside people would start using it on a small scale, get very enthusiastic and then the natural thing they want to do it plan for sort of and extension into the organization. They budget out to a certain height, so it had to be reviewed by a guy far enough up, who didn't have personal involvement or experience and he says, \"Well, this is strange.\" They tried to explain to him, it's all very strange words, so he turned to his IMS colleague and said, \"Well what is in this, Jake?\" He says, \"Well, I don't know, but God, my instincts are that if it were any good you'd see it in IBM and other people, so I wouldn't play with it.\"</div><br><div>\tTime after time it would crash for various reasons like that and one of the really dramatic times was a few years ago. I think I'm jumping ahead. In the mid 70s, when office automation was beginning to be very popular and all sorts of research groups tended to come toward it, including AI people and almost everybody would look over at ours. They were doing more flat files and more conventional stuff and they just didn't get it, what we were trying to do. Our architecture was very sophisticated, front ends and back ends and all. They thought, \"Oh, you're very baroque and complex and you had this complex whole bunch of commands.\" Well, of course our vocabulary had grown by then.</div><br><div>\tThey would say, \"Well, we're going to put an AI module here that will start understanding the user and make a model of what the user knows and understands so the user will not have to learn much at all, you see.\" Who do you think won out? Pretty soon I was out of resource funds and SRI shut down my laboratory and something like 14 people altogether migrated over to Xerox park and took a lot of stuff with them. Xerox park somehow just culturally rejected all of this NLS structure and they took the mouse, but the key set thing, that's too hard. That really is very simple to learn and its amplification power on flexibility and speed is very significant.</div><br><div>\tAnyway, I essentially got banished and just by luck and perseverance we got SRI instead of just shutting down everything, that they owned the commercial rights to the NLS system so why don't you see if someone wants to buy it? Oh. It turned out that various time sharing companies thought that we could get into office automation. Like buying something at a rummage sale, Tymshare Cupertino picked us up.</div><br><div>\tNo one else seemed to want to do this and I was very interested in keeping it alive so I went along. There followed some very dismal years with the commercial world learning what they're facing and a lot of problems and no money being put into continued development. Then McDonnell Douglas bought Tymshare and Tymnet in their acquisitions to go into the information systems business commercially and I took the opportunity then, because I was really interested in heavy knowledge work. I knew you couldn't walk in as a seller of this and make the about one visit or so that a customer will put up with you, to get this commercially of interest. I could, without really a lot of- Now nobody knew what I wanted to do, but in a big organization, if you do it anyway, you know how the story is, but you run the risk, which I ran of trotting around in the aerospace side and slowly the architectural things that we developed and the reasons why you'd have them for a large organization, including remote procedure calls and virtual terminal specification and the like. A grammar driven command language interpreter that lets all kinds of people's command languages evolve flexibly.</div><br><div>\tAll these things that began to be bought when McDonnell Douglas launched two years ago a sizable program they called a CAD/CAM/CALS to integrate their architecture of the life cycle of the big programs. Also in parallel, they started doing some pilot uses of this, the NLS was renamed AUGMENT out there and enhanced a bit as a customer would sort of pay for it, but not very dramatically. It still is kind of dramatic and Air Force Communication Command picked it up among other people that did. They wanted to really go after an organizational wide information system.</div><br><div>\tOur system was running on deck 20s and they ended up with five such mainframes on the base down at Scott Field at Illinois. They had a very dramatic things they were doing throughout the whole organization. We had a public and private key signature system that you could sign things and then the Defense Department, the government I guess ... It's really beginning to happen, my memory. My wife says, she looks at me whenever I complain about it and stomps, says, \"The problem with you Doug is you can't remember how bad your memory used to be.\"</div><br><div>\tAnyway, that was very dramatic, but again, when they started to go out for an RFP for worldwide buy and they functionality that they wanted out of the AUGMENT system was clearly to be immersed in the RFP, but the General wanted to talk to some vice president or somebody could say that McDonnell Douglas would get busy and start porting it to modern platforms so  they could count on having it available [inaudible 00:51:21].</div><br><div>\tThe particular guy that owned it at that time was at some component far from us who's business experience was in small business data processing with mini-computers and he was so cautious and everything that the General lost his cool and stormed out and they rewrote the RFP to water down very much what the requirements were and a year or so later, AT&T won that for worldwide installation for something like 940 million dollars.</div><br><div>\tThere have been a whole series of things like that, that were hard to take, but they taught a lot because the paradigm shifts and what happens is a reality out there. For all of the ensuing evolution that's going to go on, that's the kind of thing that we face. The problems of that.</div><br><div>\tLet's do some more transparencies. Just to continue a little bit about the early picture of the, of what it is that we're trying to do for humans, the idea of mapping an external map of your concepts was important. It is also important to realize that this is why we [inaudible 00:52:37]. Look how quickly I can jump, like that. My focus can jump to any object on my whole repertoire of concepts, that is if I haven't forgotten.</div><br><div>\tNot only that, but it moves to almost level of abstraction you're willing to deal with. My automobile, boom. Oh, the dashboard, boom. Oh, the fuel gauge, boom. What I'm really interested in is whether it's electric or pneumatic, boom. It just moves around like that. I just thought it was very important when you're making this external map, as well as trying to make a good reliable map is to provide that really moving around and jumping. Just scrolling is just, I don't know, we can jump. Not only that, when you get there you'd like to arrange for the level of abstraction if you have a hierarchical organization, I'd like to look how deep in that I want to look and what kind of a view.</div><br><div>\tThat jumping and viewing came out of that and a bunch more. There's a way of-</div><br><div>\tYeah. This is sort of a model of the 1960s sort of thing that we were building and I just don't have time to go into it in detail, but in here to say yes, we were motor driving our tools sitting on here. These things set up a computer stored file that I can provide both content and structure with annotated text and graphics and a lot of attention to naming and addressing the elements, the objects inside of there, which gives you a lot of flexibility in both jumping and remote manipulation. Any one of those addresses can be used at any time as well as a direct select click to operate on any object you want in there. As you learn about your way around, it's very flexible.</div><br><div>\tYour file position is now a very explicit sort of thing when you're moving around and the viewing and filtering and the windows and such is a very important thing when you get there, put on display. Perceptual mechanisms can get the kind of things that provide the understanding.</div><br><div>\tThen, other people being able to see it was important and other people being able to share files, so this was the image in the 60s and it matured to some extent.</div><br><div>\tThank you.</div><br><div>\tI want to talk about it at quite a different level then, very quickly. Anybody working in a technical world realizes that inter-operability between technological models is very important and its purpose generally is to avoid having information islands between which electronic communications cannot flow. All the work towards standards has been developed on that. What's really important also is to begin looking for humans, that you assume that there's a similar purpose inter-operability to avoid having information islands between human knowledge work domains. We sort of have figured that this takes care of it.</div><br><div>\tIt does in a way, but if you realize that that intercommunication between our knowledge work domains has been and continues to be very largely a matter of paper. The whizzy wig did very well at that.</div><br><div>\tYou say, all right, I've got a couple domains and each domain is usually compound. For an individual you've got all the activities you're in a domain and I'd be willing to bet that for most of you, they're not all that terribly interoperable. They will be sometime, but when yours is very interoperable that means all of the connections you really flexibly can integrate and use all that stuff. What about between you working with somebody else? What if they buy a different system? How interoperable are you two for sharing and working together?</div><br><div>\tThen you say well, you consider it, domains aren't nice little circle things all drawn off, they've got all these funny shapes, which is a good thing because that's the way the whole work gets done. The basic thing is that paper is the way in all of our domains we do interchange. Desktop publishing whizzy wig, that's really been a great help. Using the computer just to automate that whole process of paper exchange between people. As we're going to extend significantly into online access, online study, online collaboration. That requires a great deal more inter-operable coordination. That's just beginning to do a few.</div><br><div>\tIf you look at the history of CALS, with what I gather from it, it started out that I send you an electronic form, but it's going to be coded in a way that you can map it into whatever publishing or editing system that you have so you can print out what you want there like that, so I can bring in from different sources, maybe an STML markup thing-</div><br><div>\tAt McDonnell Douglas, we pieced together and look. Look at all the compound domains that are needing to work together. Someplace in there there are customers, right? Almost forgot them, see. Then we really started looking and you can look at CALS and in a CALS world, there's a huge domain out there for their acquisition work and then there are all their logistic support. That opens up in a whole big world and that world's starting to say, we plan to standardize, et cetera. All these companies are now hustling about, how do we comply with CALS?</div><br><div>\tLook you guys, you've got so much going on there that for the most part is probably a more complex set of knowledge work going on that needs coordination. You need a whole bunch of study about providing for that interchange among yourselves. I've been just trying very hard to get them to realize that just following CALS- Then I've learned to my glee that CALS is starting talk about pages of technical documents. When I read the spec on the first such thing I got, it's remarkably like AUGMENT, that's great.</div><br><div>\tIn McDonnell we, thank you. In McDonnell we've done some pilot operations which were really to get people very enthusiastic about what you can do within a very complex project. All sorts of ways you can use. From source code, for specs, for writing, for work break down structures and the like.</div><br><div>\tThen we just said all right. One picture about the ATF program that they were doing. Some guy was in there, says, \"Boy I need that.\" Not only inside of this, but look, when we get going into manufacturing, that is if we do, we've got a structure up there of up to six thousand companies. For many of those interchanges, they're highly technical, complex, recursive and legal. If we could facilitate that such that I can include the links, explicit links to things like specs and things like that and change waters out in that world and facilitate it and people trying to guess how much that would save. They get up to 2-300 million dollars and they say well, it's probably more than that. That much a year in an environment like that.</div><br><div>\tI've been trying to talk to more and more larger organizations and say that the economic thing every year of getting this sooner would be worth a tremendous amount. How soon do you think there'll be something in which you actually can have what we started calling an open hyper-document system, meaning that among all of those players and within them, no matter what platform you're working on, you can get that kind of inter-operability such that you were seeing in the film, 20 some years ago.</div><br><div>\tThat's a real challenge, but if you wait until the normal process of the vendors all fighting to come out with what they call hypertext in documents, and finding out what will really work in here and what the users really need in that environment, which no one really seems to be getting yet. Hypertext is so immature out in the world in general. He says well, there'd be very important to try to accelerate the process of looking ahead to see what the requirements are really going to be, getting experience to see how you'll harness the stuff. What changes it makes and all the organization and roles in there. It's a very important thing that's worth an awful lot every year and for industries that are fighting for competitive position or the economic situations are decreasing, getting worse, it's an important thing to consider.</div><br><div>\tThe model came out of the AUGMENT world like this. You sort of saw our sharing files and moving around. If all the different domains say some segment of the files can be shared that way, well then email, which we call throwaway mail because it isn't very well managed, et cetera. It's sort of like getting a telegram. What do you do with it? You save yours and the guy who sends it saves his and if I want to refer to one of his early ones can I count that he's got a system he can go get it? All that is very flexible.</div><br><div>\tThis is innovation we did by 1970 so that by the same sort of process, submitting and sending an email item , I can take any size document and it goes into a library and gets cataloged and that library has a name, a journal name. The system guarantees forevermore that that copy can be retrieved whenever you want it in exactly the form it was published. It's in there and cataloged and can be received and we add the hyperlinks to all of that. It's an extremely powerful system. This sort of makes a record of the dialogue. When we first implemented that, I locked up this. I said, \"There's so much question about people to get the experience of what kind of a memo writing through the system you do.\" You're going to get people to put it in here rather than just wrap it up in an email package. I put the lock on this. We couldn't use the throwaway kind for the first four years. That everything everybody wrote in email became a permanent record in this catalog journal item.</div><br><div>\tThere are a lot of interesting stories about people that just couldn't stand it. One guy quit. Somebody else never got something in there. I kept saying, just put your anticipated picture first to start with of what your design is going to be. \"Oh, I just can't, because it's going to be there forever and I just can't, it isn't ready yet.\" Pretty soon you got them past that hurdle and people would start using it, employing it and using it for all sorts of miscellaneous things like, \"Let's all meet at the Dutch Goose for beer after work.\" There's a lot of that in there.</div><br><div>\tThe number of items in that original journal is now over a hundred and thirty one thousand and going back to 1970 and it's just a tremendous history of the way the thought and the designs and the arguments, et cetera went through all those things. We were trying to get it saved a little bit. Then there maybe have been 20 or 30 such journals I'll send to different customers, all of which show lots of history. It's an extremely impact high end value thing which for some reason just hasn't appeared in the world in many other things. Neither is that shared screen which we've had working in our system since 1972 regularly. Not with the video one, but you share all the rest of the screen on the phone. We've been using it internationally and such.</div><br><div>\tThank you.</div><br><div>\tI didn't talk about the external document but involving the control and cataloging and back links on that is a very powerful thing. This just shows how you have document ready to submit. Submit a form like and email with a bunch of fields you can do. You submit it. The data goes in and updates the catalog, the permanent repository gets a copy of it that you can't change, the assigned number attached to it and a citation notice like an email gets sent out. You get that email and it just tells you this journal one and here's it's copied to and any comment on and a link on it that will point off to the actual document that you can get anytime you want to. Documents 1972 or something like that, I can just go, click.</div><br><div>\tTalking about a big reference base. Hypertext is emerging now in something like hypercards or supercards comes out and look. I can take an existing body of knowledge and I can integrate it in there and fix it so that people can sit down at the work station in which that's stored and can bomb around inside that gloriously. It's a beautiful way to make it so that I can study and move around inside there. It's getting lots of people using it so this other generated knowledge can really be that sort of thing.</div><br><div>\tThen you say, well next step.</div><br><div>\tNext step is sort of said, well, call this reference material a handbook if you wish and I can get multiple people producing and looking at it. They get the data there and this is sort of controlled information to bomb around it and somebody's sitting off the side can fix it up for them like that but it's not something that the community can [inaudible 01:05:59]. The next step is to provide for the community of users to generate collaboratively the evolutionary handbook like that. The term handbook just grew in my vernacular.</div><br><div>\tThat's a new kind of dance.</div><br><div>\tThis cycle of things of which a lot of contributions by all the people, and if when they're recorded and they point right to the current state of any given design or plan or something like that. A lot of that dialogue about it. You bring in material from the outside world, external documents, intelligence, caller information, your community and integrate that into this coherent hyperworld like that. People can develop structured indices and all to help you find about it and the current state of this thing is a dynamically evolving thing.</div><br><div>\tThis cycle around here where the community's busy developing it and every day using all that material and bombing around it. It's what sort of happens in a very disjoint implicit way anyway as the knowledge product of a project or community evolves. Let's say, look, we've got a chance of making that be a very coherent, dynamic environment in which the current state of this design or something and all the rest of your expectations and plans and commitments and trial ideas and such are right there in a nice organized way and very attainable by everybody.</div><br><div>\tJust that idea came on strategically as if we put a lot of energy and focusing on making that really work. That that not only has a tremendous payoff in any project area you know of but it's going to have ability if you deploy it right to be harnessed in very important ways in the process of change and evolution.</div><br><div>\tIn the trial operation we did within say the NASA program, everybody in the community has, they jump to a locator. This top level view they'd get, they've got these choices, so they jump, open up this one and they'll get this one. NASP? What are there? Oh, these are different things describing within that locator. Oh, I want to do the project itself. Bingo. That's probably a link off to- Oh no, maybe this is still another level within that locator file. I see, okay are these things offered there? Let's go to that. That'd probably be another thing. I said, oh, I want work breakdown structure. Boom. Then I go to a file that's a work breakdown structure file. The hierarchy there is just great. You're dropping down there, it says, oh, these are all these things that are available, let's go down and see those.</div><br><div>\tYou drop down until you actually get down to the task assignments, but at any place you can have links pointing off to any sort of supportive reference material. People that, since we've got this big complex project to manage, they just drew all that. It's a very simple utilization of the thing. For having status reporting and many other simple things that just fall out of beautiful applications much less the very heavy work associated with designs.</div><br><div>\tThey're busy trying to specify what this open hyper document system could be in the outside world. To me it's, you know, starting the years ago and a lot of it by two or three years ago I was saying, it's got to be something that's more than within one aerospace company if you want to do this. It's got to be industry wide. You'd better start talking to other people. It was very hard to get the permission and if you did get a vendor to start talking, well, come over and talk about it. Well, there marketing people get very nervous. Well, it's got to be something legal, what's in it for us? No, we don't want to open, we-</div><br><div>\tI finally decided that I should probably set up some kind of neutral platform in order to get this kind of cooperative pursuits going. That's when I decided I would leave McDonnell and try to do it. In the end I got the chance to set up something called the bootstrap project within Stanford University. There, to try to get people moving, they've agreed that we could set up a trial platform and support the AUGMENT running on one of their old deck 20s that we could start getting a community of people to start do this bootstrapping we're talking about. I'll explain a little more about that in a minute.</div><br><div>\tWe start giving these three day intensive seminars and there's some flyers back there describing all of that. We've had four of them now and the interest has grown quite a bit to the point of those organizations are beginning to talk among themselves about formulating the kind of community that I'm going to give you a brief description.</div><br><div>\tIn the strategy I've had for years, it's always been that if you've got an organization and you want to apply a significant strategy about how it changes, that organization needs a change process inside. You say well, let's categorize inside a given organization that has a given product, and this could be a division, a company or whatever you would like to talk about it. There're people there and they're augmented with these people human processes and the tools already and doing their work to produce it. If you want to improve that, your only choice is you're improving that augmentation system, so here's the improvement project itself.</div><br><div>\tImproving this augmentation system. If it's explicit at all, you can identify it as an activity and it might be distributed, whatever. You're just saying, look, that's an important thing, so if you've got something like that in an organization then we can start talking seriously about what kind of strategy would be best. This total quality management thing coming along and one of the central things about it says continuous improvement. They all have high level intention and assignments like that. You're getting, in that sense, a B. When they say total quality, you're saying look. They're beginning to say it's more than total quality of just your product, it's total quality of the organization. You say, great. This is what we've been talking about. There's lots of opportunity for change and real strategies for doing it.</div><br><div>\tOne of the strategies is saying, how do you get this thing up to speed and improved? You go through a lot of reasoning to say that the concern about how to improve that has very little proprietary nature and it's very common form organization to organization almost no matter what they do in their A activities. We call it the C activity that supports B, then we're talking about hey, if you started out with a collaboratively run, C community and you started thinking strategically about that doing a lot of things.</div><br><div>\tIn a sense, Miter is serving a role like that for some people and other sense I get that Miter's serving a B role and if you look at Miter itself, who's it's B and who's it's C, you realize there are a lot of ways to employ this kind of picture of an A, B and C. The real bootstrapping would come in to say, look, if I can find things to make this kind of a community work a lot better, as a prototype and it's a handbook cycle kind of prototype, then it really could hand across to there when it's enough. These people can participate and really see it and those are things that as rapid as possible can get up in there. I get accelerated, I get gains in all three levels and you really get the kind of compounded interest that would make things go.</div><br><div>\tThat's been the dream for many years and that's what I'm talking about with bootstrapping organizations and there are some more elegant sort of ways you can look at that. You can say well, let's really augment that. Really, let's do that in a very intensive way, in fact. Next.</div><br><div>\tHe says, well, how do I do that? Well I get a B unit there that's improving that. An improvement project, knowledge workshop improvement project if you want to. That's going to be very explicit in booming that to keep that ahead and then I say well, how do I improve that? Well, I can feed that back because if this one's all busy improving- Anyway.</div><br><div>\tThat's throwing it way too fast but just to give you the impression that there's a lot of ways to start thinking about the way that that feedback can go. Where you can invest in here. The rate you're investing in here. What's the role of pilot operations in there. What's the role of such things as who does the exploration for a given organization about what advanced technologies and methods are available to it. When they do that study, how do they disseminate it and make it available inside the organization? This kind of a tool is going to be natural for that.</div><br><div>\tThat's the same kind of thing this thing wants to do, so let's get that intelligence collection and integration, something that'd be a very basic pursuit in here.</div><br><div>\tLet's go. Yes. Let's go. These people listen too slowly, it's-</div><br><div>\tAnyway. Information. All these lessons learned comes down into it, the external world comes down to it, their own internal stuff and that digestion, it's like.</div><br><div>\tThen a lot of value goes back that we can talk about. Next slide.</div><br><div>\tHow's that?</div><br><div>\tI just want to point out that these are the- The recorded dialogue that's really an integrated part of all these three things. Community intelligence collection and such, making it really available and a community handbook. These are the kind of three specific focus to put in there that are really- we've got a lot of headway in learning how to do it, but we've never had the chance to really cultivate it. That's what we're going-</div><br><div>\tLast slide please. How do you like that?</div><br><div>\tThis is sort of a picture of that feedback. The community like that who's output is to be augmentation. Everything that generates probably can come back in here, unit. It's a beautiful design, a multiple feedback loops. Thank you very much.</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tThanks very much Dr. Engelbart. We have time for a few questions, if there are some from the audience.</div><br><div>Speaker 5:\tA microphone or a-</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tWell, why don't you stand up and speak loudly.</div><br><div>Speaker 5:\tI'd just like to ask you about the issue of vested interest in the United States. Most of the technology we have in running organizations, operations research and so on, dates back at least to World War Two and this technology [inaudible 01:16:18] help us win the war. You have to contrast that with other countries that didn't have so much in the forms of investment they had to protect. Japan's scope robotics, [inaudible 01:16:26] just going right to cellular phones. I'm wondering if by the year 2000, this new evolution and technology that you foresee and that's going to change organizations, do you think that we will, the United States, will be viewed as a leader in this or do you think it's going to be like robotics, somebody else, some other country will do it before we will?</div><br><div>Douglas:\tI'm quite pointedly trying to give America the best chance. Is what I've had in mind for years. In a sense, it's going to depend on who's culture really picks to it, but I sort of feel like it could become something to go parallel with the total quality thing and U.S. could really potentially jump in the lead on this. That's what I hope.</div><br><div>Speaker 5:\tI guess what I was asking is do you think that the American psyche and the American culture are more compatible with this viewpoint than say, some of the Eastern cultures, for example?</div><br><div>Douglas:\tThere are a lot of levels of the cultural impact this would have. For instance, the Japanese apparently do a lot of consensus building. Does it have to be face to face? They might like the consensus, but this wouldn't work for it. The United States has a lot of individualistic feeling, but it's beginning to emerge that we've got to do more cooperating. It just might start moving because a lot of this total quality thing for instance is, if you're a winner of a Baldrige award, one of the things is, you've got to start sharing your scheme for the rest of the people. We'll just see because the alarms are ringing all over the places in the boardrooms and everything else that we really have to do something. I say well, come and talk to me about this strategy because it's been cooking for many years. I'd love to have it become part of a dialogue.</div><br><div>\tThat's really what I'm trying to do, is get a going forum to really start looking at this from the points of views of different kinds of organizations. We get both vendors and General Motors and Kodak and Boeing.</div><br><div>Speaker 6:\tOne question I had was, it occurs to me that you're going to get the organizational change only if you've got the perception that there's a problem.</div><br><div>Douglas:\tExactly.</div><br><div>Speaker 6:\tPart of what you're saying is that, if disaster comes tomorrow, most organizations might recognize the need. Might. Okay, we have the history of the British Army and other sorts of things to demonstrate that that's not necessarily the case.</div><br><div>Douglas:\tRight.</div><br><div>Speaker 6:\tWhat can you do or what techniques have you seen over your experience are capable, are useful in generating the perception that perhaps there is that need two days before disaster?</div><br><div>Douglas:\tI think that there's a lot of people broadcasting that sort of thing already. A very effective book was just published by Rosabeth Kantor at Harvard Business School called when Giants Learn to Dance. She wrote the Chains Masters too and she's just saying, \"Look at what we're caught with. The tremendous increase in all the pressures to change and the tremendous increase in the opportunities and the decrease in available resources, because there's so many more people trying to get into the game of changing,\" and sort of like that. We're really in a bind.</div><br><div>\tIt's setting the stage for, yes, we need a strategy. Then the business about any one time, the evolution of perceptions, about do we need it? Or if we need it, what are the opportunities? How much change is coming? Et cetera. Those are part of the framework and the only way I've seen it really change is via experience. Experiential exposure. The words and the gestures can mean a little bit, but when you come have to divide up your budget and different people want it and they're all the people you've fought with or been your friends for years, it comes actually time to try and take out any significant hunk of that for something new and different. You've got to have some kind of experience that sort of says that all these young so-and-sos that are sort of telling me what we ought to do. What do they know about running an organization? They need-</div><br><div>Speaker 6:\tBe careful, lest you make the case for shooting management.</div><br><div>Douglas:\tNo, because whatever you'd replace them with would very soon be acting the same way without that kind of experience, which wouldn't be so good. The same way goes, maybe our organizations are all going to have to die and we get a new breed. That's a tremendous waste and so I just say, look, there will be a new ones popping up. One of the interested people coming into these seminars and going like this is a venture capital firm. We've got all these start ups. It's time, they could start in a brand new way. Hustle, hustle, hustle.</div><br><div>\tThat's great. The real challenge comes within our institutions. It's more than our organizations, it's out whole institutions. We can't just replace our current legislative system with a new one or something.</div><br><div>\tThey all have that very similar basic needs and the growth of perception is just going to be some kind of a snow-balling thing and the best way I could ever think about it was to start a sort of a trial community, funded well enough, participating enough. We've got a lot of the characteristics growing about how it'd have to become. One of the specific things that can start working on are helping in the CALS. People helped them CALS and helped the organization see what something like this open hyper document thing, how- Do a really dialogue while they're using these things. In as representative a way as they can about what are they going to need downstream and what's the trade off between closing in on some pseudo-standards or leave it open for awhile? The dialogue about that and just in intelligence would be very worthwhile.</div><br><div>\tThen, part of the strategy is to make it so the exposure to the executive levels inside these organizations is right, so they have a sense of that is doing and can see it. Then they can start bringing some of that same kind of trial prototypes inside their organization and again, by ingesting the lessons learned from different organizations' prototype pilots done  to the C community and back up you can learn a lot from everyone else's. There's a great deal to learn about how big a pilot operation you need to test whether this if going to work over a division. Is five people enough? Ten? Fifteen? Twenty? By the time I get up to ten or fifteen people it's going to be very expensive to outfit, train, equip a bunch of people and if it's going to be a significant pilot you'd probably have to take them offline for a couple months to get them in gear. Boy, that's expensive and how can I justify that?</div><br><div>\tWell, if the first trial runs I can share it by buying into something where a lot of people are doing it Shared risk, multiplied gain. Anyway, they're just, all these decades this has been on my mind. I've been watching and interpreting and re-integrating all the observations. I could be have gone way off being put, at least I'd like to get the dialogue going and experience of sharing this, because if it's right, I think it's a lot of payoff. That's what I want to see. I want to see it tried before I sit down and quit.</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tJust one more question.</div><br><div>Speaker 7:\tHow much of a road block do you see towards this evolution coming from the patentability of the look and feel of software.</div><br><div>Douglas:\tWhoa, oh, oh. I guess everybody heard you, huh?</div><br><div>\tI don't know. That again in the cooperative sense ... you're saying what general group social professionals might start doing. Maybe they'll just decide to pay the bill of that'll succeed and let that fight going on. One interesting thing is that I think some of that look and feel is that if you look ahead to the sort of size of evolving vocabulary of function and types of objects that you're going to be dealing with in there, that some of those metaphors and looks and feel are going to run out of gas. That's true in any natural language, that you move into some discipline, that the further you go into it, the more refined and larger becomes your vocabulary. You're effective choice of what I'm going to do and how I'm going to execute it, if you're limited to pidgin English, Oh, I've got an icon for each one. I've got to got through a menu or, no I can hit control something for doing it, that's a very limited kind of vocabulary. We just were trying to prepare for open ended vocabulary way in the back and we see what it means.</div><br><div>\tI have a feeling that those early things they're fighting over now, people are going to laugh at, like buggy whips or something. Those are just my intuitions.</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tWell, thank you again very much, Doctor.</div><br><div></div>",

Toward that end, the following needs for interoperability between knowledge-work domains will have to be met, and something such as the \"open hyperdocument system\" must become available for widespread use.</div><br><div>As computers become cheaper and we learn more about harnessing them in our cooperative work, they will come to support an increasing number of different domains of knowledge work. Moreover, the sphere of computer-supported activity within each domain will steadily expand as more function and more skill become employed.</div><br><div>It is predictable that increasing functional overlap will occur as these expanding domains begin to overlap. It has become apparent to me that someday all of our basic knowledge-work domains will be integrated within one coherent \"organizational knowledge workshop.\" This leads to thinking about an over-all, integrated architectural approach to the ever larger set of common knowledge work capabilities emerging within a multi-vendor environment.</div><br><div>Much has been accomplished to date in standards and protocols in the highly active field of networked workstations & servers, where \"interoperability between hardware and/or software modules\" has become a central theme.</div><br><div>This paper considers the \"interoperability between knowledge domains.\" This interoperability theme will be increasingly important for a workable CSCW framework as the scope and degree of CSCW increases. Dramatic increases will predictably create a marked paradigm shift about how to organize and operate cooperative human endeavors. I think that two phenomena will yield changes and a paradigm shift that will make this interoperability of paramount importance:</div><br><div>with a relatively unbounded technological frontier together with immense and growing economic pressure, the speed, size and cost of computers, memory, and digital communications will continue improving by geometric progression;</div><br><div>awareness and importance of CSCW is emerging, with a predictable trend toward our doing more and more of our personal and cooperative knowledge-work online.</div><br><div>Assuming an inevitably gigantic scale for our inter-knit \"CSCW world\" provides some important guidance for the continuing investment of our business resources and professional time.</div><br><div>For one thing, each year earlier that an effective degree of knowledge-domain interoperability is in place within important organizational or institutional domains could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars -- could mean the difference between vitality and sluggishness.</div><br><div>And for another, we would prefer to avoid investing our research, product development, or organizational-change resources toward ends that won't be interoperably compatible within that future, radically different paradigm.</div><br><div><br>INTEROPERABILITY IN AN INDIVIDUAL'S KNOWLEDGE WORKSHOP</div><br><div>To begin with some very basic knowledge-domain interoperability issues, consider your own (future?) \"Computer-Supported Personal Work\" (CSPW). Assume that you have acquired a fairly comprehensive, online \"knowledge workshop,\" and that you have found better and better software packages to support the kinds of tasks shown in Figure 1:</div><br><div><br>ONE PERSON'S KNOWLEDGE WORKSHOP<br>Figure-1. Each functional domain is a candidate for working interchange with all others.</div><br><div>Consider what you will some day have when your individual workshop inevitably becomes truly integrated. Between the E-Mail and the task-management files, or the status reports, or whatever, you really would like to tie these functional domains together with a flexible free-flow of information and linkages.</div><br><div>What kind of interoperability do you have now? I happen to think that the interoperability provided today within most CSPW domains has a great deal of improvement yet to be pursued. But I'd resist any serious argument about this unless it be approached within the context of a coherent \"CSCW interoperability framework\" such as outlined below. Let me say in warning, though, that from such a framework I will contend that the marketplace for CSPW will change drastically as CSCW takes hold within our larger organizations and their inter-organizational communities.</div><br><div><br>INTEROPERABILITY IN A GROUP'S KNOWLEDGE WORKSHOP</div><br><div>Suppose that you and a colleague each have a fully integrated CSPW domain, comprised of nicely interoperable sub-domains as in Figure 1. And suppose that you want to work together online. Consider the interoperability between your respective knowledge-work domains, as in Figure 2.</div><br><div><br>KNOWLEDGE DOMAIN A / KNOWLEDGE DOMAIN B<br>Figure-2. Close cooperation between compound knowledge domains puts new demands on knowledge-work interchange.</div><br><div>Now you're faced with a new challenge and a new problem. You might set it up so you have a few lines that cross between domains, but why stop there? When do two people in intense cooperative work NOT need total interoperability? In fact they depend on it heavily in the paper world. Why not online?</div><br><div><br>INTEROPERABILITY ACROSS TIME AND SPACE</div><br><div>Yet another example of multiple domains is found in the familiar time-place matrix shown in Figure 3. In many cases, activities in the different quadrants involve the same substantive work content. Is knowledge-work interoperability between the quadrant domains an issue? Very much so. For example, face-to-face meetings need to flexibly utilize anything from the whole organizational knowledge base, and the meeting's records should immediately become an integral part of that same base for later-time work.</div><br><div>(quadrant showing Different/Same Time/Place<br>Figure-3. Collaborative processes generally considered within four separate domains.</div><br><div><br>A POINT ABOUT ONLINE GROUP KNOWLEDGE WORK </div><br><div>The matrix in Figure 3 is very neat and ordered. Here in Figure 4 I offer another picture of multi-domain, group knowledge work which isn't so cleanly laid-out. This reflects how I feel about the various knowledge-work domains with which my CSPW domain must interoperate.</div><br><div>(what the grid looks like in actual practice, not neat quadrant of separate activities, but all over the map<br>Figure-4. Consider some knowledge domains with which you intersect significantly.<br>5a1<br>The purpose of interoperability is to avoid having information islands between which information cannot flow effectively. Since we grew up in a paper-based framework, we've given little thought about how much exchange and interoperability support we really do have, and how much we depend upon it. To be interoperable in our CSPW world we could simply print out and hand over the hard copy. With WYSIWYG screens and Desktop Publishing, we're doing that with nicer paper, faster.</div><br><div>As we inevitably move from computer-supported paper generation and exchange to computer-supported online creation and exchange, we will need the same level of interoperability. And as the number and scale of knowledge domains involved in a given CSCW \"web\" increases, so does the need for \"online interoperability.\"</div><br><div><br>INTEROPERABILITY ACROSS KNOWLEDGE DOMAINS </div><br><div>To appreciate the extraordinary complexity of heavy industrial knowledge work, and the associated requirements for interoperability, consider the important functional domains within a large manufacturing organization producing a complex product, such as an airplane. It is a serious enough challenge to provide effective interoperability among the knowledge workers within any one of the domains in Figure 5; just consider the inter-domain challenge. And then consider that some of these domains, such as customers and suppliers, exist \"outside\" the organization, each with its own equally complex multi-domain structure.</div><br><div><br>MANUFACTURING ORGANIZATION<br>Figure-5. Each functional domain is a candidate for working interchange with all others.</div><br><div>THE LARGE MATRIX ORGANIZATION</div><br><div>An interesting example comes from my time at McDonnell Douglas Corporation, where I marvelled at how something as complex as one of their airplanes gets a business plan, and gets designed, manufactured, flown, and supported. Look at any given project or program (\"P1\" through \"Pn\" in Figure 6), and the functional support that's required (\"F1\" through \"Fn\"), and the exchange that needs to happen within this matrix.</div><br><div>(grid showing intersecting knowledge domains<br>Figure-6. Consider the domains within a matrix organization of projects and functions.</div><br><div>Each function has to share and exchange working information with many programs, and each program has to share and exchange with many functional support areas. Wherever there isn't mutual interoperability, the workers at the domain intersections will have to suffer with inter-domain switching and converting -- which is very expensive. Depending upon this kind of functional program matrix will require knowledge-domain interoperability across the whole organization.</div><br><div>THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY AS A CASE IN POINT</div><br><div>To really appreciate the magnitude of this situation, let's look inside one of those aerospace programs.</div><br><div>A Large Aerospace Program. McDonnell Aircraft Company is participating in a bid to build the Advanced Tactical Fighter (\"ATF\") for the Air Force. It's possibly one of the most technically complex products anyone has ever dealt with.</div><br><div>On top of that, they have an urgent mandate to start practicing \"concurrent engineering,\" where the designers have to work concurrently with the manufacturing engineers. This will require intense back-and-forth cooperation between the two knowledge domains, which no one really knows yet how to do on such a large scale.</div><br><div>Also, significant design and manufacturing problems are often delegated to the first-tier suppliers shown in Figure 7, so the cooperation with that tier is also close and intense. Then the first tiers hand off to the second tiers, and so on. So, all-in-all, you have something like 6,000 companies cooperating -- each a separate, complex, knowledge-work domain. They are expected to keep track of all business- and technical-exchange records throughout the design and manufacturing process:</div><br><div>(supplier pyramid with McDonnell Aircraft program at the top 2000-3000 people, interacting with  multiple tiers of suppliers below, each interacting with the other<br>Figure-7. Islands in supplier hierarchy of a major aircraft program would be very costly.</div><br><div>I should point out here that the arrows in the diagram represent the legal flow of contracts being awarded. The actual exchange of documents would be shown as a two-way flow of continual negotiation and refinement throughout the design and manufacturing process -- developing specifications, proposals, change orders, testing records, and so on. And for any part within any airplane, the manufacturer must later be able to identify when it was delivered, by whom, and even who was the shop foreman at the time of assembly.</div><br><div>Also, a program of this size in the aerospace world would typically comprise a 10 to 30 year life cycle. So when we talk of Different Time / Same Place, and Different Time / Different Place (Figure 3), the definition of \"Time\" includes decades, not just hours or days. Even in a short time span and without turnover, it is not unheard of for a project team, in any industry, to occasionally lose sight of some important design decision trails, and consequently waste time and money repeating old discussions or past mistakes. Consider the likelihood, and the cost, of such lost history occuring in this long-term environment.</div><br><div>To comply with the Department of Defense's (DoD's) forthcoming Computer-aided Acquisition and Logistic Support (CALS) mandate, all documents exchanged between the DoD and its contractors must be transmitted, updated, and managed in a standard, computerized form -- a truly gigantic interoperability challenge.</div><br><div>Two Companies Teaming. The situation is even more complex: as with most new, large-system, DoD procurements, the Air Force requires ATF bidders to be joint-venture teams comprised of major aerospace firms. In this case, McDonnell Aircraft is teaming with Northrop Aircraft. Figure 8 shows how Northrop would form its part of the program, with several thousand workers internally, in close collaboration with several tiers of suppliers:</div><br><div>(same as Figure-7 but with Northrop Aircraft as the lead company)<br>Figure-8. Islands in supplier hierarchy of a major aircraft program would be very costly.<br>8h1<br>And then picture the two companies as a team (Figure 9), and consider the intense demands for interoperable recorded document exchange across functional support and project domains within this ATF-contractor team -- within each company, between the two companies, and between them and the DoD (remembering the CALS initiative).</div><br><div>TWO AEROSPACE COMANIES REQUIRED TO DO 'PROGRAM TEAMING' (shows two interacting knowedge networks)<br>Figure-9. Close cooperation between large organizations puts new demands on knowledge-work interchange.<br>And then consider Figure 10 and all of the recorded interchange between these two companies and their supplier hierarchies, throughout the multi-decade life cycle of the program.</div><br><div>(shows the two supplier hierarchy pyramids having to interact at all levels in the supply chain)<br>Figure-10. Close cooperation between large organizations puts new demands on knowledge-work interchange.</div><br><div>The Web Of Aerospace Relationships. Now consider all the other large-program webs of aerospace contractors, suppliers, and customers represented by the small sub-set shown in Figure 11. A great many of these suppliers and customers will work with many of the same contractors. The complexity becomes staggering. Within such an inter-knit web of cooperative knowledge domains, there is no practical solution for effective interoperability other than industry-wide standards -- adhered to by contractors, customers, and suppliers.</div><br><div>(shows multiple supplier hierarchies now including Boeing, Lockheed, and all their customer organizations)<br>Figure-11. With common customers and suppliers, an aerospace industry can't afford islands.</div><br><div>And every other large industrial sector must also achieve CSCW interoperability. And those sectors must themselves interact effectively. The CSCW-interoperable web will cover the world, as has clearly been or will be done for transportation and communications (e.g. telegraph, telephone, radio, or TV). I think a strong case can be made that the cost of NOT having total knowledge-domain interoperability would far exceed the cost of achieving this interoperability.</div><br><div>So how will this urgent need be satisfied -- for intense, computer-supported cooperation across the knowledge domains of our rapidly approaching future world? It would seem that our \"CSCW future\" must include something like the solution characterized below as \"an open hyperdocument system.\" And if so, then all of our research, product development and application exploration should align with and properly affect the concepts and principles by which this future state is pursued.</div><br><div><br>TOWARDS AN OPEN HYPERDOCUMENT SYSTEM</div><br><div>Several years ago at McDonnell Douglas Corporation we coined the term \"Open Hyperdocument System\" (OHS) and began to define the associated functional and interoperability requirements for the kind of wide-area online cooperative knowledge work described above. This followed several years of careful study, and some pilot trials -- one of which involved thousands of knowledge-workers using a prototype system containing many of the required capabilities.</div><br><div>Note: McDonnell Douglas is poised to move forward with requirements such as below as the basis for functional specifications and a workable procurement process.</div><br><div>In the following, I assume a need to provide basic capabilities so generic as to satisfy both the CSPW and CSCW application requirements over a broad spectrum of knowledge domains within a wide variety of organizations -- including for instance universities, standards groups, and the U.S. Congress.</div><br><div><br>SOME GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS</div><br><div>In an open hyperdocument system, basic standards for document architecture are of course important. But beyond that, facilities for creating, transporting, storing, accessing and manipulating the hyperdocuments are embedded within an open, interoperable information-system environment, and the combined functionality is available within the knowledge-work domains of every class of worker (working from any vendor's terminal/workstation of suitable capability). Under these conditions, the role and value of hyperdocuments within groups, and between groups, offers very significant improvements in productive knowledge work.</div><br><div>Two unique issues differentiate this new environment from document-support systems to date: (1) interlinking between objects arbitrarily located within a large, multi-topic and extended-history document & data collection; and (2) extensive, concurrent, online utilization for creating, studying, organizing and linking within and between the many overlapping and nested knowledge domains.</div><br><div>These differences introduce paradigm shifts that produce different system requirements from those that have been evolving in the predominantly CSPW marketplace. For instance, WYSIWYG will give way to WYSIWYN -- \"what you see is what you need (at the moment)\" -- providing different options for how you'd view selected portions of the document space in your windows. The WYSIWYG view would be but one option (and likely to be utilized with decreasing frequency). Other expected shifts are implicit in some of the following suggested OHS requirements.</div><br><div>Besides special, \"document-system architecture\" features, full achievement of large-domain CSCW gains awaits two things:</div><br><div>widespread implementation of integrated, open-system architectures for the underlying hardware and software structures; and<br>widespread adoption of new knowledge-work processes (or, \"knowledge processes\").</div><br><div>To me, these new knowledge processes are especially relevant. They will involve new systems of skills, conventions, roles, procedures, methods and even organizational structures. I believe that they will provide a much more effective matching of basic human capabilities to the heavy knowledge-work and collaborative tasks within the functional human groupings that we call \"organizations,\" and within the mission-specific groupings that we call \"projects.\"</div><br><div>In my experience, truly effective new knowledge processes will emerge only via a co-evolutionary process -- new knowledge processes and the new tools evolving together in real working environments. Explicit evolutionary pursuit with numerous, well-run pilot groups, seems called for.</div><br><div>From this is derived the position that a really good set of requirements and functional specifications for an OHS can only emerge from solid prototypical experience, in which advanced knowledge processes were developed and exercised along with advanced tools.</div><br><div>Note that the following list was derived from extensive experience with the evolution of the AUGMENT System (an OHS prototype owned by McDonnell Douglas) and its concurrent application within numerous real-work pilots.</div><br><div><br>ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF AN OHS</div><br><div>Mixed-Object Documents -- to provide for an arbitrary mix of text, diagrams, equations, tables, raster-scan images (single frames, or even live video), spread sheets, recorded sound, etc -- all bundled within a common \"envelope\" to be stored, transmitted, read (played) and printed as a coherent entity called a \"document.\"</div><br><div>Explicitly Structured Documents -- where the objects comprising a document are arranged in an explicit hierarchical structure, and compound-object substructures may be explicitly addressed for access or manipulation of the structural relationships.</div><br><div>View Control of Objects' Form, Sequence and Content -- where a structured, mixed-object document may be displayed in a window according to a flexible choice of viewing options -- especially by selective level clipping (outline for viewing), but also by filtering on content, by truncation or some algorithmic view that provides a more useful view of structure and/or object content (including new sequences or groupings of objects that actually reside in other documents). Editing on structure or object content from such special views would be allowed whenever appropriate.</div><br><div>The Basic \"Hyperdocument\" -- where embedded objects called \"links\" can point to any arbitrary object within the document, or within another document in a specified domain of documents -- and the link can be actuated by a user or an automatic process to \"go see what is at the other end,\" or \"bring the other-end object to this location,\" or \"execute the process identified at the other end.\" (These executable processes may control peripheral devices such as CD ROM, video-disk players, etc.)</div><br><div>Hyperdocument \"Back-Link\" Capability -- when reading a hyperdocument online, a worker can can utilize information about links from other objects within this or other hyperdocuments that point to this hyperdocument -- or to designated objects or passages of interest in this hyperdocument.</div><br><div>The Hyperdocuments \"Library System\" -- where hyperdocuments can be submitted to a library-like service that catalogs them and guarantees access when referenced by its catalog number, or \"jumped to\" with an appropriate link. Links within newly submitted hyperdocuments can cite any passages within any of the prior documents, and the back-link service lets the online reader of a document detect and \"go examine\" any passage of a subsequent document that has a link citing that passage.</div><br><div>Hyperdocument Mail -- where an integrated, general-purpose mail service enables a hyperdocument of any size to be mailed. Any embedded links are also faithfully transmitted -- and any recipient can then follow those links to their designated targets in other mail items, in common-access files, or in \"library\" items.</div><br><div>Personal Signature Encryption -- where a user can affix his personal signature to a document, or a specified segment within the document, using a private signature key. Users can verify that the signature is authentic and that no bit of the signed document or document segment has been altered since it was signed.</div><br><div>Access Control -- Hyperdocuments in personal, group, and library files can have access restrictions down to the object level.</div><br><div>Link Addresses That Are Readable and Interpretable By Humans -- one of the \"viewing options\" for displaying/printing a link object should provide a human-readable description of the \"address path\" leading to the cited object; AND, that the human must be able to read the path description, interpret it, and follow it (find the destination \"by hand\" so to speak).</div><br><div>Every Object Addressable -- in principle, every object that someone might validly want/need to cite should have an unambiguous address (capable of being portrayed in a manner as to be human readable and interpretable). (E.g., not acceptable to be unable to link to an object within a \"frame\" or \"card.\")</div><br><div>Hard-Copy Print Options to Show Addresses of Objects and Address Specification of Links -- so that, besides online workers being able to follow a link-citation path (manually, or via an automatic link jump), people working with associated hard copy can read and interpret the link-citation, and follow the indicated path to the cited object in the designated hard-copy document.</div><br><div>Also, suppose that a hard-copy worker wants to have a link to a given object established in the online file. By visual inspection of the hard copy, he should be able to determine a valid address path to that object and for instance hand-write an appropriate link specification for later online entry, or dictate it over a phone to a colleague.</div><br><div>HYPERDOCUMENTS IN A GENERAL INTEGRATED ARCHITECTURE</div><br><div>Besides the aforementioned Hyperdocument Mail and Hyperdocument Library features, there are other important CSCW features that are dependent upon an \"integrated system\".</div><br><div>Shared-Window Teleconferencing -- where remote distributed workers can each execute a related support service that provides the \"viewing\" workers with a complete dynamic image of the \"showing\" worker's window(s). Used in conjunction with a phone call (or conference call), the parties can work as if they are sitting side-by-side, to review, draft, or modify a document, provide coaching or consulting, and so on. Control of the application program (residing in the \"showing\" worker's environment) can be passed around freely among the participants.</div><br><div>Inter-Linkage Between Hyperdocuments and Other Data Systems -- for instance, a CAD system's data base can have links from annotations/comments associated with a design object that point to relevant specifications, requirements, arguments, etc. of relevance in a hyperdocument data base -- and the back-link service would show hyperdocument readers which passages were cited from the CAD data base (or specified parts thereof).</div><br><div>Similarly, links in the hyperdocuments may point to objects within the CAD bases. And, during later study of some object within the CAD model, the back-link service could inform the CAD worker as to which hyperdocument passages cited that object.</div><br><div>External-Document Control (XDOC) -- Same \"catalog system\" as for hyperdocument libraries -- with back-link service to indicate links from hyperdocument (and other) data bases, for any relevant material that resides offline or otherwise external to the OHS.</div><br><div><br>THE INTEROPERABLE OHS ENVIRONMENT</div><br><div>Here's what the share-and-exchange domain within an open hyperdocument system might look like:</div><br><div>(shows a standard knowledge infrastructure supporting 'Throw-Away Mail', shared files, a 'Journal' of permanently recorded documents, and an 'XDOC'  collection of any accumulated hardcopy documentation or tidbits -- such that any given item in any given knowledge domain can be shared across organizational and software boundaries while the hotlinks and other embedded attributes of the file retain their integrity and inter-operability)<br>Figure-12. Interoperable knowledge domains share and exchange documents.</div><br><div>The requirements outlined above form a basic support platform for any group knowledge work effort, with interoperability across time and space (including all quadrants of the Time / Place matrix), across knowledge domains, and across organizational domains.</div><br><div><br>THE INTEROPERABILITY INVESTMENT</div><br><div>It could take a lot of effort and expense to get such knowledge-work interoperability. You might say, \"Why don't I just do the part that's important?\", as in Figure 13, Choice A. Someone else's idea of what's important to share and exchange may look like Choice B:</div><br><div><br>(shows three different knowledge networks A thru C, where A has the most gaps in its interoperability, and C has the most interoperability, 'compare the value of interoperability B versus A; or C versus either')<br>Figure-13. Providing for extensive interoperability will be expensive.</div><br><div>As more and more of the knowledge work in each domain is done online, then the benefits of a comprehensive degree of CSCW interoperability will rapidly increase.</div><br><div>How do you decide how far to go? You'd compare the value of A vs. B, or B vs. C. And you'd say, \"Well, let's see, with each successive choice I'd save more money, wouldn't I?\" So how much more? We don't know how to quantify it yet. But, once you start finding a way to make some of the major sub-domains interoperable, by the time you've picked these selective lines in Choice A or B, what would be the incremental cost in dollars and effort to get Choice C?</div><br><div>But the real question is, what does it cost in dollars and effort NOT to have the interoperability.</div><br><div><br>THE OHS MOVEMENT</div><br><div>I asked people familiar with complex aerospace projects, \"Well all right, let's make a guess -- if the kind of hyperdocument interoperability we are talking about here were installed for instance under the whole design & manufacturing operation of this ATF program, what might the yearly dollar benefit be?\" They look back and forth at each other for a while ... So I offer: \"$300,000,000 a year?\" And they look at it and say, \"At least.\"</div><br><div>User organizations must realize that they can't just sit back and wait for the standards groups and computer vendors to deliver this, because there hasn't yet been enough orientation or application experience in this area. It seems necessary for the larger user organizations to take responsibility, to become pro-active -- e.g., with exploratory pilots, active development of associated knowledge processes, and cooperative requirements definition -- and then show the vendors that there is a sizable market for this.</div><br><div>But they must also realize that it isn't just a matter of specifying, procuring, and installing the resulting system -- they have to learn how to employ it effectively in this extremely complex environment. And they must realize that they have to cooperate more intensively than before: The stakes are extremely large; there is too much to learn and events are moving too rapidly; the resources and degree of stakeholder coordination involved are both very high.</div><br><div>To find this effort emerging from within the aerospace industry seems likely enough to me: it is the most complex work environment I know of, and a most urgent candidate for harnessing the benefits of wide-area CSCW and effective knowledge-domain interoperability. But other large organizations also have pressing needs for exactly this same capability -- for example, car manufacturers, computer vendors, government agencies, consulting firms, universities, consortia, and standards groups.</div><br><div>To me there is a real need for a cooperative movement -- among large organizations that are heavily dependent on group knowledge work -- to coordinate planning and operation of advanced, cost-effective pilot explorations in this area and to share the experiences and results. This relates to what I am currently doing at Stanford University with the Bootstrap Project: exploring with a number of larger organizations how a \"cooperative, CSCW community\" could be set up and run to provide both valuable pilot-application experience and substantive knowledge products.</div><br><div>One of the first projects of this community would be to collaborate on the requirements for an open hyperdocument system, and on a procurement approach. The community would employ a prototype OHS platform (initially AUGMENT from McDonnell Douglas) to collaborate on this and other related projects. This hands-on experience will be an important part of the exercise, and should provide valuable insight into how to employ these capabilities effectively. Similar pilot trials will be launched within member organizations.</div><br><div><br>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:</div><br><div>This work was sponsored by grants from the Kapor Family Foundation, Sun Microsystems, Inc., and Apple Computer, Inc.<br></div>",

They tell us they would and they gave us some briefings that are very impressive and very very bright guys doing great things under there, but there's the difference about living with a lot of this stuff, some of the details will get you. We have to see. Small talk people tell us they can do a fast prototype in 4 months or something like that, just exactly like it.

How much experimenting with the application did they have time to do? Today the vendors don't. They're pushing for it out. Who's going to start doing that exploration in trying to do it in an objective way and trying to really push in the heavy knowledge work domains that you can get to parallel, be pilot operations. You can compare notes to see. Somebody doing it in computer-aided software engineering may think they need all kinds of exotic things in there, but if you generalize on it and come back you can find out that a lot of times it's the same conceptual need as you have over in this kind of work.

You're going to have file servers. The journal system there just has to be grouped servers for the publication thing and it's just got so much power to be able to put a document in that journal and then just tell somebody about it later or it's there for proof. If you're going to have any constructive dialogue that gets recorded in there, you have to have these nailed down things that you can point at, that you can go back and find out why a decision was made. There will be a chance if that record is there like that.</div><br><div>Audience:\tWe're in danger of overstaying our welcome so thank you very much again.</div><br><div></div>",

This year we are truly delighted to have the person we have speaking for us this evening. To introduce him, is indeed quite an honor. I will introduce him by presenting him with an award which truly recognizes his similar contributions to the field of computer science and computer engineering. This is the computer pioneer award for the IEEE Computer Society. This award was established by the computer society to recognize and honor the vision of those people whose efforts resulted in the creation and continued vitality of the electronic computer industry.</div><br><div>\tThose folks who have truly made a difference and have changed the way we fundamentally think about that which we do build and use. Doug Engelbart who's receiving this award this evening joins a list of people that is truly stellar in the field. Those of you who follow the field with any kind of historical perspective will recognize the names that I will read of the previous recognized Pioneer Award winners. Understand only then, the role in which Doug is esteemed to be placed, Jeffery Chu, Art Burks, Harry Huskey, John Atanasoff, Nick Rochester, Jerry [Hadad 00:01:46], Bill [Vanderpull 00:01:47], Nick Metropolis, John Kemeny, Ivan Sutherland, John McCarthy, Dave Wheeler, Ellen [Plis 00:01:56], Kurt Haag, Jim Pomerene, Peter Nauur, [Hadrian Van Vainguden 00:02:03], Robert Evertt, Art Samuel, Ronald Johnson, Klaus [Vath 00:02:09], Frederick Bauer, Marcel Hoff, John Cork, Ralph Plummer.</div><br><div>\tThese are people who have had truly distinguished careers in this field. We are absolutely delighted to be able to recognize the contributions of Dough Engelbart. Those of you who saw the series that was on PBS some 3 or 4 months ago on the history of computing, recognized the segment I'm sure in which Doug's pioneering work in human, computer interaction was presented. Doug currently is director of the Bootstrap Institute. He was born at Portland Oregon. He served as US Navy officer and electronics technician during World War 2 and received his BS in Electrical Engineering from Oregon State University in 48. He worked at NACA before it became NASA Ames lab until 1951. Before going out to earn his PhD in double E at the University of California Berkeley. His thesis was in applying plasma phenomena to digital devices. The work resulted in the issuance of a dozen patents.</div><br><div>\tHe stayed at Berkeley as assistant professor to 1956 when he left for Stanford Research Institute now SRI International where he worked on magnetic computer components and studied digital device phenomena and miniaturization scaling potential. This work produced another dozen patents. In 1959, Dr. Engelbart launched the SRI Augmentation Research Center which he directed until 1977. The center provided him with the opportunity to pioneer modern interactive work environments for which he is being honored by this award. Using his NLS as the exploratory vehicle for research into the knowledge worker organization the basic results not only included the development of 2 dimensional editing, the concept of windows, cross file editing, uniform command syntax, the mouse, promote procedure call protocols, mixed text graphic files and structured document files, ID of processing, hypertext and many more things. It basically became a paradigm of thinking about computing and something that changed the field dramatically. When he left the center he had, had some 47 members. It is with great honor and distinction that I present to Doug this medal for the society. It reads, Dr. Douglas C. Engelbart human computer interaction pioneer award of 1992. We'll put this there.</div><br><div>Doug:\tWouldn't it be funny if I truly became speechless? There were years when I was worried. I was surrounded by a wife and 3 daughters in the 60s. At the dinner table it was very, very hard to get a word in that's why ... I managed to surmount all that. The next hazard is for me to forget what I was going to say. More and more as you get old, you find yourself stumbling, you can't remember the name of your street or something. I have this wife sitting here whom I owe a great deal of how to get here. Thank you Ballard. She's not normally not one to make great jokes but she did a classic about me. One about the 30th time in a month I complained, \"God I can't just remember like I used to.\" \"Doug, the problem with you is you can't remember how bad your memory used to be.\" With that, you guys are going to be lucky to get a coherent talk.</div><br><div>\tWhat I really try with you is really weaving into a story about what I've been trying to do for many years. A real thread about paradigms. I didn't even know what it was until maybe 10 years ago. I found out they had other names for it. Then thinking back I realized that the issue of paradigms was something that had an immense effect on my life. Not all of it was particularly pleasant. I really thought it was worth a lot because as a theme was announced I really truly feel that probably the biggest single factor in limiting how well the technologies that are emerging can be integrated into society to produce really beneficial positive benefits et cetera. The biggest single factor limiting how rapidly and effectively we can do that is in the shifts of paradigms.</div><br><div>\tThe paradigms have to shift in order for us to integrate that stuff so that it can be really useful. John C. Brown [inaudible 00:08:17] concerned today and I'd like to just talk about that. First off, I'd thought I'd read the definition of the paradigm. I'm reading it from a book by Joe Barker whose today's guy who goes around talking a lot about what are paradigms and how much they affect your life. First to drop paradigms forward was Kuhn in late 60s in the structured scientific revolutions. He wrote, scientific paradigms are accepted examples of actual scientific practice. Examples of which include, law, theory application and instrumentation et cetera. These provide models from which spring particular coherent traditions of scientific research. Men whose research is based on shared paradigms are committed to the same rules and standards for scientific practice.</div><br><div>\tLet's go down Adam Smith in the Powers of Mind, a shared set of assumptions, the paradigm is the way we perceive the world, water to the fish. The paradigm explains the world to us and helps us predict its behavior. When we are in the middle of the paradigm, it is hard to imagine any other paradigm. The book goes on to explain a lot of the effects of paradigms, how they get shifted. The basic thing in there though that I want to bring about is that if you have a different paradigm about the way that you look at things, there are things that you just don't perceive about what could be in a different paradigm.</div><br><div>\tI wasn't exactly prepared for that. The thing that kicked me off that pursuit was 41 years ago. It established for me a whole new paradigm, I got engaged. The next Monday driving to work, I started to think, \"Well I've better settle down and think about the road ahead at work.\" I thought, \"Jeez that's funny, now I got a steady job.\" Which to a depression kid is an essential thing.</div><br><div>\tIt was a nice place to work but it was like a hallway down to infinity with nothing but a few spun doors and no great events. What's my professional goal structure? Steady job? Well then I got more thinking about what professional goals. By that evening, I'd said, \"You know what I'm going to do is try to develop a set of professional goals for what I really want on my profession.\" Some horrible thing then happened as I made the terrific blunder of just trying on for the hell of it. What if you set as a professional goal to see how much that could benefit mankind?</div><br><div>\tWhat's the most I can do in a career to benefit mankind? I warn everybody against it, don't try that. I was 25 going on 26, idealistic enough to stick with it. I said, \"Well I'll put in there enough money to make out all right, there ought to still be a lot of liniments.\" I spent weeks thinking about, what would I do. I tried all kinds of crusades in my mind. I really need better economic theory; I'll go study and generate a brand new economic theory. Jeez Doug, you're 6 or 8 years behind the other kid that would be doing that's a bad head start. \"Well I'll go to education, the world needs that.\"</div><br><div>\tThen I realized that I can't, I'm a bit behind. What kind of crusades could I join? I kept thinking about them. I'd read enough about some crusades to realize that, yes you can go drain all the swamps in the mosquito infested areas. You could cure malaria, you could get rid of malaria, but the natives would overpopulate right away and the side effects would probably be bad. One day after several months of this, it suddenly dawned on me; you know what the problem is? The world is too complicated. The problems we're facing are too complex and there isn't enough time to work on them. Just while trying to figure out how you can best contribute. Just within minutes, something dawned on me, there is challenge. How you can help human organizations and institutions better cope with complexity and urgency click into place and has been locked ever since. I'd been a radar technician during World War 2 and had electrical engineering degree and I knew enough about the computers could print and do funny things. I knew what radar could do about any kind of a spike on a scope.</div><br><div>\tI knew that if a computer could print punch cards, it could do anything you wanted it to display. If you could sit there in front of a display and interact with it and get all kinds of really interesting new symbology. Because a computer could really work with you, you could do new ways of thinking. Other colleagues could be sitting at workstations or tied to that same computer complex and you could be collaborating. That launched my career. That was in the spring of 1951. A month or so later, some unsuspecting girl actually went ahead and married me. What did I do right away? Drag her off to Berkeley to graduate school because they're computers there. It's a long strive, it's a long thing.</div><br><div>\tTurned out that what I was talking about doing was way too radical. \"Interactive computing? We don't even have our computer working yet.\" We got to travel down to UCLA and see their first Western Automatic Computer the SWAC was sitting there working. I had been to graduate school 8 or 9 months before I went to that trip. That's the first computer I ever saw. It maybe 500 words of memory and mean free time failure of less than 10 minutes. I think all the guys were excited using it. You can imagine that there is some guy sitting there with a paradigm of what you can do with these computers interactively someday. You ought to get started thinking about it and computers were in that state. I had to do some thesis work, any interactive uses of the computer was out. They just didn't just believe in it. It was expensive and it's too crazy.</div><br><div>\tHow about manipulating symbolic logic? How about interactive teaching machines that are right there with you? Too radical, so I took some component research and got out. I was told then, \"If you keep up talking what you're talking about, you'll be an acting assistant professor forever.\" I believed them because of the way it was communicated to me. I decided I could go to SRI and figured that if any management any place in the world could be talked into exploring this, I could potentially get a research contract with SRI. Meanwhile I'll be a good boy working [inaudible 00:15:55]. Working my own patents and got credibility. Also had the experience of working my way very rapidly into a professional fraternity. That's great; I'd be on national committees and talks organizing things. This was in about 3 or 4 years.</div><br><div>\tI've never had that experience since because then I got enough credibility that I realized that I want to start this thing about using computers. I really mean it, that if I don't get started here I'm going to leave and go someplace else. \"Well we'll give you some part-time chance to do it.\" Little later I got a grant from the obscure forest research office. I went within about 2 weeks from being somebody who had reputation to being able to write clearly, talk clearly, invent well. Instead of like that, the needle just went down like this. Not for you guys it went like this. First think piece I wrote, my boss looked at it, \"13 pages? I can't even tell after the first 4 pages what you're talking about.\" I said, \"Yeah I know it, it takes a while to describe each concept.\" \"Well look here's a paper written by your friend Bill. It's a proposal.\" A whole proposal takes 1 page. It's been a work on an algorithm for switching theory.</div><br><div>\tI look at it and yeah that field is all established. The whole vocabulary is there and it takes about 2 sentences to describe the problem. A couple of sentences to describe an approach and a few more like that. I can't even get you to understand all this page is about what I'm trying to do. That was my fault; this was my first bumping into paradigm. It's been there over and over again. What I like to do is, let's see first is I'll be covering a little more history. Then extremely lucky after a few years to get research money from ARPA. The [inaudible 00:18:03] NASA and air force, that lasted me until over 1 years. Quite a long time in that community. What I had done before that in preparing for this whole thing is in the late 50s realizing that I was implicitly assuming that computer power was getting faster and cheaper and smaller.</div><br><div>\tThat would only come about with miniaturization. In those days they were talking about building integrated circuits with transistors. There was a lot of talking and discussions. I got a grant to do a study on making things smaller and electronic components particularly. This was very exciting after about 3 months of that, I realized when I discovered dimensional scaling that's really an art in physics that you can do a lot of interesting things with dimensionalist numbers and the like. To anticipate the sorts of variations that are going to occur in devices and phenomena if you change the physical scale. That cleared up for me and they're all kinds of phenomena that we haven't any experience with because we don't play with things that small.</div><br><div>\tWhen you get down to very small, you've got a whole little dictionary of interesting concepts and phenomena to harness into devices sop no worry at all if there's one. Today pursuit of nanotechnology is just, I'm just convinced that it's going to come. Anyway I was convinced enough that I could go on after this stuff that I was trying to do about interactive computing and problem solving et cetera. Because I felt very confident that the digital power is going to be there. The next thing though was quite dramatic for me to learn as I was reading about all that is in biology there were a number of very interesting treatises about what happens when you scale living organisms. How big could a tree be? Well it turns out dimensional scaling itself that the fiber strength limits you that you can't have a tree like 300 feet or something.</div><br><div>\tThere's the absolute limit of which a tree holds itself up. Things like the smallest mammal north of Spitsbergen is a fox because as they're smaller their surface to volume ratio goes up and they maintain all the warm blood and stuff like that and many, many things. It was just very interesting. One thing I did when I gave a talk about the dimensional scaling of components was talk to them like this and say, \"What do you think would happen if you looked around, somebody played a trick on you and made everything you could see 10 times bigger in every dimension?\" The way your eye spans, they'd be nothing changed about the perspective of things.</div><br><div>\tDo you think you'd notice it? Well it turns out, you'd certainly would because the strength of any object is proportional to its cross sectional area. The load on it goes up with the volume. Every muscle in every structural thing has essentially 10 times the load to carry. Your chair is built for you that's 10 times as heavy. Your body is then that you'd fall to the ground and you'd break your bones. You'd have trouble breathing; you'd have trouble ingesting food. No one could come to your help because no one else can move or something. That would be rather drastic. That stayed in my mind. Later I want to ring that bell on you as we get going. Anyway, the system we built carried us out. By the mid-70s the system we built with hypertext interactive things and all that was very dramatic but it just didn't fit the perspective that everybody else in the research field and the computer field and the office automation field perceived as how computers should be used.</div><br><div>\tSimilar things like the mouse and other things we've done were credited very nicely but we lost our research funding office shut us down, \"You're not being relevant, you're going in the wrong direction.\" SRI replaced me as manager of the lab I built up because I apparently been doing bad things. People actually suspected me of being sneaky and misleading people. It turns out that once you get on the other side of the paradigm it's as though you're a political radical and people are slightly impressed. They expect what you're going to say. They shut their ears; it's a very interesting phenomenon. There were quite a few like that throughout the years. It was very bruising, I lost my lab, I lost my job. I had to go out in the commercial. It turns out we could tell everybody let's take that system up.</div><br><div>\tThey decided to auction off; I went off to the commercial world, the industrial world. It was a very rough life with very little leeway for giving people a chance to try things new but we learned a great deal of that. Am I bitter about all that experience? Well I'm bruised a little bit about that. What it reminded me off is the time I fell off a runaway horse, a real runaway horse with its ears rigid running as fast as it could run. Totally unresponsive to reins or anything else like that just went crazy. Went over a ditch and got to the next choice and it went in a way I didn't think it was going to go so I fell off. I thought I'd done very well because I was bareback.</div><br><div>\tWas I mad at the horse? No. It's a fact of life. [Inaudible 00:24:11] start looking and realizing how totally human is this business of the paradigm and how much every one of us can just totally go along not recognize things. I watched my own experiences a few times too. I don't generally publicize them. I was totally blind to things. A few years later I was kind of sickened by it. How did I ever think like that? You can ask yourself, if the ARPANET had as much success as it did between when it opened in 1970 and the early 80s when the personal computers came out.</div><br><div>\tHow in the world could all the personal computers be built assuming that when you sit there at your desk and not be interconnected. You couldn't tell anybody, Steve Jobs said, \"Nope, you don't have to be bothered by time sharing or anything like that.\" IBM people built theirs, came out in the market, no provisions for it. You ask yourself, how many years? That's almost a decade, at least 8 years. 8 years of lost opportunity for the world to really start thinking about to do to connect your personal computers and interact and really have significant mail. Everybody in the ARPANET was using mail, FTP file transfer. The time sharing systems there were operating as servers. We actually had a server model back and forth, anyway never mind. Those are examples. How do we keep from suffering like that?</div><br><div>\tWhat I want to do is go through how did I generate some of the models I did. They're still sitting there as something trying to get the world to listen. Tymshare is a company that bought us auctioned from SRI. McDonnell Douglas in 1984 bought Tymshare and Tymnet and a number of other organizations to start a new line of business out of the commercial world, virtual information processing. Through those experiences, it was really interesting to go on and actually provide change. The system is commercially used by thousands of people. Some of them in big organizations with dramatic kinds of capabilities that aren't there yet in many other systems. We had lots of experience and about 5 years ago I kept trying to get McDonnell Douglas and others to realize what they got there is something that's really a very basic thing. If it's going to be used for opt in the world it's going to be involved with collaborating among a lot of organizations and they couldn't see that.</div><br><div>\tI decided to leave, go raise a flag on a little independent thing called the Bootstrap Institute. What I'm really trying to do now is get the world to look at this framework, this way of thing. In among those there's a strategy for how we can improve it. I'm going to get independent and try to sell the strategy. I'll start showing you some of that strategy. Is this all accepted? Can you turn on the slides please? Maybe I shouldn't have pushed the forward button. 1962, making a think piece. It was a very important step. The most important thing I ever read. There was a funny little report from 2 authors from [Ryan Corporation 00:28:01].</div><br><div>\tThey're talking about how to organize multi-discipline projects. They said you're going to suffer if you just bring these different disciplines together. You'll get this kind of harassing they'll say, \"Our discipline is already solving that.\" Or this is a trivia problem, it isn't worth working on et cetera. That's the same thing through the 50s I was experiencing. I said what you need is to have a framework, a conceptual framework that's appropriate for researchers going to do. The process of generating a framework was called a search. I said all right I'm going to make a framework because I couldn't get anybody to listen. I spent 3 years then in 1962 published a CRI report. A year and half later it came out as a chapter in a book.</div><br><div>\tThat's 30 years ago and the framework that I felt there just steered me as straight as anything. I really like to talk. What to do? I said there you need to have more interaction with the display. We did research and came up with this kind of device. We got to have displays instead of typewriters because in the future that's the way you're going to work. Why waste time on a technology that's not going to be there in the future? That's a basic strategic issue, we should still be listening a lot. why waste time doing experiments in your organization with technologies that are going to be out of date in 5 years or 10 years? Let's just generate the video display. This is a workstation terminal, interesting bullpen where we all did our work. Group meetings 1967 all of us around a very flexible out laying processor doing our work.</div><br><div>\tThat indication [inaudible 00:29:53]. 1968 I talked the computer conference into letting me have an hour and half session. This was the Brooks Hall in San Francisco, 20 foot screen. This is the kind of video projector they had in those days, was very powerful black and white. Up in front we had a workstation for me that was engaged with the monitor here with the TV camera catching my face, another TV camera moving down in the back of the room. They sat there with the controls of switching and frame splitting. I got excited ant turned around. They could split the frame and get the picture of me along with what I was showing. Split another way and I could show the way that we were working. That was the debut of the mouse. This other key set here is something we brought along so you can code in the characters you wanted to. You very seldom had to take your hands off this combination if you're just moving around and navigating and doing things. John was managing the invisible interface.</div><br><div>\tYou see people working like this, the speed and flexibility and invisibility of doing that it's unparalleled and anything else going on today so we still live like that. That's the key set and the coding code which I'm not expecting you to memorize. When Jeff Wilson would come on there to show the way we organize our source code and stuff, they could just bring his face right up in the back and he's telling everybody. He's 35 miles away down at SRI doing that thing. They zoomed in and watched his hand working on here as he was telling people he was unconscious of them showing that. It was very dramatic just the way he would talk and moving around.</div><br><div>\tThe way that hand was really moving like that. Bill [Paxton 00:31:50] came along like that and switched over and was showing us the retrieval schemes that you could use for this hypertext structure thing like that. We did a lot of that shared window stuff. The architecture of it by the mid-70s had it built into the system. I'm here giving a demonstration that's projected up on the screen. We call up somebody else in Washington DC and pretty soon it's his screen and he's running it and telling them over the speakerphone to us. We were doing that as a matter of course. What's a little bit different about this is Ballard took this over in Singapore. The other guys in Washington DC were just 12 hours apart. We were interacting very effectively on 1200 [inaudible 00:32:37] I think that was at that time.</div><br><div>\tA lot of history, a lot of technology, a lot of experience out in the world. What is the paradigm stuff have to do with that? I made a map of if it starts out as an objective of making organizations a lot more effective. I said, first new paradigm is what you have to do to look at the whole capability infrastructure. The next one is there is a whole system that augments humans to provide that. The next one is you need to provide the co-evolution of the elements of that pragmatically. Then a question, what's the most payoff if you're trying to do that complex pursuit? Search of an investment criteria because the scale of the job we're really creating a whole system augmentation thing for any organization. It's immense scale job so you can't just plow straight ahead. In fact what's an investment criteria? I ended up with a model about what improvement process elements are that could lead to a bootstrapping strategy.</div><br><div>\tWith that I said, \"What's the most effective technology to go after first?\" The capabilities from this infrastructure that would be best to go after early are something I gave the name of CoDIAK capabilities. It needs to have global inter-operability. The best support for that would be a multimedia open, hyper document system. That's how the 1960s something like that came about. Deployment targets, advanced pilots, improving, getting this whole process started. These are photographs taken from a multimedia presentation I can give. I'm going to walk through that and there's more than we can talk about really. I'll try to hit, a high spot would be here and here and here and here and this so we'll just see. I'm pretty absent minded but I can fight fast enough.</div><br><div>\tThe objective, high performance organizations, not getting into too much detail, I don't have time. That's what I really want. Thinking that today's organizations if you think about them as social organisms, what kind of functional performance capabilities do you see today that you liken it to very sluggish dumb, dimwitted, near sighted organisms. By the way I'm not talking about whatever organization you come from of course. The approach that I involved after all we've seen the reason there is what I call the capability infrastructure. That there is a big infrastructure capability built on top of what I'm going on.</div><br><div>\tThis little box representing multi-level capabilities that provide an infrastructure while higher level capabilities depend upon the integration of capabilities of lower level like that. The whole infrastructure capability is there to look at. We've never really seriously looked at that before. In fact I started around another paradigm window that opened for me. You don't find anybody who's talking about that little thing. No discipline seems to be responsible for it. Well what's this augmentation system? Well a whole system augmentation comprised of what I ended up dividing it into 2 categories, subsystems. A tool subsystem and a human subsystem.</div><br><div>\tLet's just take a detour now and look at that. What we have to start with is Mr. and Mrs. or Miss Human. They very rapidly became very oriented about the knowledge capabilities. Here's some simple engineering model. We have motor mechanisms by which you can affect the outside world. You got sensory perception mechanisms by which you can observe and perceive what's going on. You have mental apparatus can process all of that. In fact we often get the model of what we're talking about all the conscious in that little circle. That's really what's important. I used to draw that very large then conscious just started a difference to my better educated wife I would put it in there. In the ensuing 30 years, I've really learned a lot about how tremendously important that unconscious part of mental mechanism is. The conscious part is very important too. I don't mean fancy psycho-therapeutic talk about the unconscious. I just mean there's so many things that you filter out to observe better.</div><br><div>\tMany amazing talents you have that you don't know come from where. That they're unconscious. What happens to capability infrastructure? Very primitive people or even animals you find they're getting a lot of skills, knowledge and training or modeling after the society around them and they'll build a capability structure. It doesn't come with the machinery. What comes with the machinery is a latent capability to absorb skills and to sense things and generate perception. You have to adapt to an environment before you develop a capability infrastructure. There's some kinds of skills and knowledge you have to build that are meant to provide that limited capability infrastructure. Well as the world progressed and you've started being social with customs and methods and language et cetera, that capability infrastructure got much more sophisticated. Started doing a much better job of harnessing the latent capabilities.</div><br><div>\tIn other words, this system over here augments the human in order to produce that capability. This was just immensely important to me to do it. To talk about paradigms, what I'm unfolding for you is my private inner thing that's been driving me. This unfolded 32, 31, 30 years ago. It just had a tremendous impact, but it also set me apart and created a great deal of isolation. It generated the thing from which I got this pretty award. As all this grew and I've been very interested in reading anthropological studies of primitive societies to find out, before they had artifacts of any great degree, how sophisticated this could be actually. Develop a capability infrastructure that's amazing. I began to think more and more about language as being an augmentation invention that was incredibly powerful and beautiful. That turns out what I spun out on. Then you say the societies began these artifacts.</div><br><div>\tThat further enriched and all that but at introduction of every artifact would cause concurrent shifting and orientation over here. This was a big thing for me to start realizing. This evolution of this augmentation has been going on since way before history. I was thinking I was going to come along with some jazzy new stuff over here and revolutionize it and alter people. It's already augmented, tremendously beautiful, sophisticated thing. What I should do is go out and find out what professional disciplines deal with this augmentation system. Surely somebody must, it's so important, big vacuum paradigm issue. Somehow that system is not something vocabulary visible so I had to give it my own name the Augmentation System. It doesn't go over very well, it takes a long time for me to get people to hear about it and talk about it. Pretty soon they're talking about some technology over here.</div><br><div>\tIf it's social scientists, they're talking about something just over here. You're saying, \"God dang it, please listen.\" It's an integrated system that co-evolved. You can't just come along and throw something brand new in here and think that's going to automate this side. That it's going to start a set of evolutions in which the co-evolution will make something different here. As this part evolved, we got say like the 1960 or 1970 era where we had lots of sophisticated stuff in here. At some point, that was quite a system. As you introduced all the computer technology, what's happening? Boy are you changing the world. Especially the information and knowledge stuff. Are you changing things over here especially for the language and then a whole bunch of other stuff often here will change.</div><br><div>\tHere's that scaling study I did. Because at every natural organic organism environment, the change of part of the dimensions of it in any significant scale would produce qualitative differences past a certain point. You change the scale quantitatively, you get quantitated differences. It's inevitable comes the point at which you get qualitied differences. That unless you're prepared for it and orientated comes as a complete surprise. Aeronautics people realize that an airplane if you build an exact scale model one tenth size wouldn't fly. Unless you change some of the other things like the density of the air and still wouldn't be practical.</div><br><div>\tThere's one way of looking at this is as if in some biological organism you suddenly introduced, very suddenly in terms of the evolutionary scale which was physiologically evolving. If you suddenly produced a brand new nervous system that was tremendously accelerate speed, flexibility, capacity, processing, memory et cetera, sensory perception. If all that nervous system suddenly were tremendously enhanced, do you think the organism would now be a little faster, a little smarter? Hell no. it would start inventing brand new organs, brand new working relationships between them. Probably its limb structure would change because the coordination could be so much better. It probably would change the way it's [inaudible 00:43:39]. It just be a very, very different whole organism.</div><br><div>\tPushing on this and then along in the mid-70s, they started talking about office automation. I just got flooded right out of the system. There's no way I could talk to them about, \"Hey you don't automate all the old things. You may just for the fun of it.\" The real power is going to be changing this to so you can really harness that. Carpentry changed a great deal when you got new tools and new materials. Why do you expect that our knowledge work isn't just going to change drastically? I concentrated a lot on this language area being such a magical thing. I said, hey one [inaudible 00:44:26] things about the language was when we started externalizing, take the symbols in our minds that represent thoughts and concepts and relationships that we have in language et cetera.</div><br><div>\tWe find a way to externalize them. Here's an external representation that conveys some knowledge and ideas and reasons et cetera in my mind to give you. When printing became flexible and powerful and the world adopted it and there was huge changes in that whole system. Then we went along and along came computers and what do we think of them? We don't think of it as a new medium that supplants that old stiff flat non-changeable 2 dimensional thing. We now got a multi-dimensional medium that can make a much better map in that medium of what's actually in our minds if we stop to think about it. I just said wow knowing that you can really make your media. You're going to have a much more accurate map.</div><br><div>\tThis thing, you got to put it all our relationships [inaudible 00:45:32]. Wait a minute; you can get the computer interactively to help you establish that. Great, so maybe you can make them. Many internal points and things like that it'd be a real mess to read. Wait, you can get the computer to act as an instrument to look at that complex structure and give you a view that supports your need for understanding that moment. Structuring, viewing, what's next? Moving around. Yes you can be much more mobile because the computer can give you a view around. Great, mobility and viewing all sorts of relationships. I said, that's a dimensional change. Changing all this whole system it'd be very handy to go about its evolution by establishing some of the major new dimensional things. Then letting them evolve because it's very hard to evolve into a completely new thing. I said why don't I build this thing and kept going.</div><br><div>\tThat's where the hypertext media thing came from. It's out of that and this model. It's still to me extremely important and a lot of other stuff came out of this model. In fact I got 8 minutes and 53 seconds left to tell you the next 30 years. Maybe I can just get absentminded about it and we'll never even mention it. Trying to get ideas crossed people in those days about this. Why would just being faster make it any better? One day I came into work and type that there and says it's beautiful. Next time you sit in a lecture or something, try to write. The photographer that went to take this photograph really cheated a lot.</div><br><div>\tThat's no way it would look like when we write. Big scrawling letters, every once in a while there was a gap because you had to rest. It's just a happenstance of faith that I must push through in our design and engineering gave us writing tools that were more flexible in that. Think of the difference it would have been had it been that? I said, \"Okay listen to that? What if it goes the other way?\" You can't just summarily figure out what's going to happen there if you go the other way and make it smarter. Here's another thing. There's this whole thing about if you make much changes in that human system people are going to have trouble. They're not going to want to change. You got to make it easy to learn, and to use. Been fighting that all these years, said wait listen.</div><br><div>\tThere's a paradigm issue here. Easy to learn for whom? Natural to use for whom? Like ice skates? Easy to learn, natural to use? For the ice skater. You get on the [inaudible 00:48:37] skis. Suppose people are just gotten this wheeled vehicle stuff that just gets started. You can come into my showroom and look and get on right away and pedal off like nothing, easy to learn so that of course is the way to do it. This stuff, you fall over, it's going to take you hours to learn. It's confusing, you have users rebelling. The world just gets better and better at tricycles.</div><br><div>\tYou say, \"Go look in your organization.\" How am I going to get past the tricycle stage? To really learn what new vehicles for thinking and moving around information would be like. I'm not going to get it by building a 2-wheeled device and getting to people, \"What do you think?\" the funny thing about is, I bet you if we had a quiz in this room about how many people can't ride bikes, you wouldn't say anyway. Everybody can ride a bike. What do you think you do when you ride a bike? Could you describe the detail algorithms about what your body when you ride along and turn corners and start and stop on a bike? I bet you couldn't. Because I got turned on once I was going to make 2-wheeled car. I loaded it with gyroscopes and such until one day I was motorcycling up trails. Some guy with great big Harley Davidson slipped. Three of us had to stop and help get it upright because it so heavy. It really made me think, he doesn't move along a freeway like that, balancing himself. I got to thinking about, you steer the wheels under you.</div><br><div>\tThey fix the steering on the front end of the stuff. If you tip the bike a little bit, that automatically turns the wheel. You ride on your hands by shifting your weight. I could ride it on my hands; I could ride backwards with my hands. I can ride forward, turn around ride backwards without even getting off the bike. You start thinking about that. How many of these guys are tremendous racers? You say, how many of the skills that we've developed and use every day are we unaware or unconscious of what we're doing? You have to be consciously aware of some skill before you can acquire it. No, perfect proof right there. You can go start using it. There are latent capabilities and skills and human and the knowledge work.</div><br><div>\tThat I'm just dead sure because we haven't even started exploring what you can do with that new medium. With the new processes and new methods and new conventions and the new ways we map our concepts out there. The new way we portray to ourselves. That we can harness and do a much better job in matching to what we have here as machinery. Because the current conventions and the way we do it match in an image of here's the hard copy and here's this other. Without thinking that that's not the way that God particularly tended for us to read or think. it's kind of a wonder, did God intend us ... There's quite a controversy about whether there's machinery in here that's exclusively established for language or whether we're just a smart general purpose thing that can adopt to languages.</div><br><div>\tMany of that, having spoken languages. They assume it occurred after we stopped evolving, certainly written languages did. You say is there a God given way in which to externalize our images or portray them to ourselves? No. We got all this perceptual mechanisms that is very sophisticated. That we're probably just hardly harnessing it to the tasks and capabilities. I've been sitting on that for 30 years, driving forward like that through. [Inaudible 00:52:34] two other models that we need to go after. Don't worry; you won't get of that easy. I only got another 47 slides and 3 minutes. Once in a while I do give up; I might give up the 3 minutes. Pragmatic co-evolution between the human systems, that's just what you have to find. If you're going to have a strategy it's got to be a real founder strategy recognizing humans for what they are.</div><br><div>\tBeautiful creatures that they need to co-evolve all of this in the organization. What would be the most payoff to go after? What first capability improvement would you go after? We need an investment criteria. Any useful strategic investment criteria? Yes indeed. Here's what I start to do there. I want to call it the ABC model of improvement. I want you to hear that because it'd be really interesting for me to have this community take a look at this and ask me to dialogue with me. Ordinarily what you think about what goes on in your business, all the activity, classify that as A activity. Everything you think about doing, from product development, noise-making, hiring and firing. All that stuff. Then you say, I've got a human and a tool system underneath it that provides it its capability.</div><br><div>\tNow I know that I need to improve some of that capability infrastructure. I want to get about it so let's do it. Well it says, if you're going to do that, halt any activity that's improving the augmentation or the capability of doing the A work. It could be done by the same people or whatever. Just call that B activity. If I come up with a strategy put in place. Say, I got strategy that can improve; I want to talk to your B people. I want to talk to who's in charge of B. One of the funny larks out there, again it's a very dramatic thing that people don't talk about that. I had to start thinking like this in order to try to say, why was I missing out? I'm trying to talk to people. Even worrying is if the urgency by which organizations are faced with change and challenge are steaming up and complexity is steaming up, things are getting better and better.</div><br><div>\tHe says, \"Without your knowing that maybe, if you're starting to get better and better at improving yourself there's activity going on.\" The C activity that improving that. This was very important when I start thinking 30 years that's too big a challenge for research or something I got to do. Why not strategy? Basically we look at that and say are there capabilities that you could go out and pick? There are lots of things that you could do to improve A. suppose you started isolating, thinking what are those capabilities I could choose to improve A? That if deployed appropriately would also improve B? That one investment will not only get me a step function here, but a first riveted for the next thing I improve on. Once more pretty soon I was thinking about this one.</div><br><div>\tThen that's lead me in the past few years to spend a lot more time thinking about what goes on in the C activity world. I have yet being able to find some company that can answer that for me clearly. What's your investment ratios through A, B and C? Who's in charge of C? You probably find a quality person nowadays and B et cetera. Is that the whole infrastructure? Well no. it's down to manufacturing. Why not whole? You want to improve this, what's the mechanism, the process, the budget and stuff that's improving your improvement process? It turns out that it really starts to get some collaborative things. That's where 30 years ago, the business about supporting a certain knowledge worked. Basically it's collaborative, collective knowledge work or developing. That's where the CoDIAK term comes from.</div><br><div>\tThat capability as a concurrent development integration and application of knowledge. There isn't any name for that collection and capabilities that's underlies everything. It's the capability you guys are exercising now. You're gathering some new information, knowledge that you're going to integrate into what you're developing and what you're applying. Those processes are all going on concurrently. Going on concurrently within you and within you colleagues. Your team is doing it concurrently with other teams and with other parts of the organization. That's a constant thing going on. Facilitating that turned out in ways that to deploy it would have the highest leverage of any act than they would think of in these 30 years.</div><br><div>\tThe bootstrapping came out saying; we're going to go after CoDIAK very heavily. To do that I'm going to push as far ahead and as fast I can in the technology that will advance it. There are practical things about how you make big advances like moving from a tricycle to a bicycle. You don't do it by a whole bunch of people. You're trying to encourage to make it once, you got to do it by small teams. Then they find ways to move other and transfer the technology. The whole technology transfer is something you'd like to facilitate. The CoDIAK process, that's great. After they start working on those concepts, you get to the place where you say, \"Between 2 different organizations, the C activities are not that much different.\" If the A activities might be very different but C aren't.</div><br><div>\tA activities might be highly proprietary by the time you get down to C; it's easy to make an argument. Like the quality people are sharing a great deal of stuff in here. All right, why don't I get special kinds of shared C work and C community? A special consortium, that's the bootstrapping strategy I started talking about. I can go through the rest of all the details and all that. The real thing would be a C community, consortium in the ways it can bootstrap its customers are your B people. Everybody in some real endeavor ought to have a customer that they really quality support. Who's supporting the B? B is the customer you see in your C community. A is the customer. Your outside customers are customers there, so you've got that whole thing focused on that. You got to know your customers. A has to keep knowing about what's going on out there. B has to keep to knowing too. You want a 2-way flow, technology transfer, lots or lessons learned and objects et cetera.</div><br><div>\tThe model for how this community can work is a model for all kinds of projects collaborating projects going inside. The model for all that community can work is a model for how consortiums can work. A model for how the, a real network or business organizations. You think of some of the proposed new ways organizations can be structured. People are much more flexible when they're in working relationships et cetera. That's setting up the model for that. I'm just so convinced that augmentation, the whole system approach is someday going to produce really extraordinary capabilities in organizations. I'm so convinced that the world needs it immensely that I absolutely cannot retire or sit down until this bootstrapping gets a start. Because I really feel that's a strategy that could a difference. This pledge I made 40 years ago how can I die without having tried it? I almost tried dying 5 years ago but I got cancer and got over that.</div><br><div>\tBecause how could I finish this if I die of cancer? One of the interesting things, it could almost seem like an accident that I got invited here. Looked over the papers and heard the thing, read what's going on. It seems like it's a very novel community as it stands now in order to take on some of these things, the organizations. It'd be interesting to work more with you. The world needs dialogue and I need people to interact with because being of on a paradigm that is different from the world, it really shows you. How envious would I be if you guys, all you've got a community. The things that are important, you can come and talk about, interact. You have the same vocabulary.</div><br><div>\tI haven't had anything like that. That really makes the difference. Until communities get going and share some of this. What I would really like is if it's in some way could start walking in to see, how many of these concepts, about augmentation, about capability infrastructure, about ABC models, about the CoDIAK. Theirs is a key one about the deployment in C community. How many of those concepts fit within your role? I wonder if you could quiz on that tomorrow afternoon. I'm going to wrap it up; I'm only 7 minutes over. I really welcome the chance to come and pour all this out. Thank you very much. Who's absentminded?</div><br><div>Speaker 3:\tThat gives you an idea how heavy that thing is. Really an impressive piece of metal. Thank you Doug for a very inspirational message and I happen to agree with you. This community is one that will flame in infinity with the bootstrap construct and the bootstrap project. Anyone who has some ideas on how we can pursue this further [inaudible 01:03:43] would be glad to hear from you. The reception in Doug's honor will take place now. It's not raining but we didn't take a chance, its right down the hall in front of the reception area. Don't stop at the first food station or we'll never get through. Go on past, there's three more tables. Thanks again Doug for a wonderful talk.</div>",

        "full": "<div>Oregon Background</div><br><div>Jon Eklund (JE): I want to ask you something about your education and background you went to High School, where was that?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart (DE): In Portland, Oregon</div><br><div>JE: Portland, I know you were born there and then after High School...?</div><br><div>DE: I started in Oregon State college in Corvallis and I guess that was 1942, I think. I went down and enrolled in electrical engineering and one of the reasons was I had heard about an exciting new technology in the military called RADAR and somehow there was a training you could go through to learn about RADAR and didn't particularly have aspirations for any other military career so I figured I'd get ready for it by taking electrical engineering. I didn't have any career plans, but that was just coming out of the depression and my father had been dead since I was nine. So there wasn't much to orient me about a career, but I was interested in getting an education.</div><br><div></div><br><div>RADAR and the Navy</div><br><div>JE: So you did electrical engineering for a couple years and then went to the Navy, is that right?</div><br><div>DE: By the end of my sophomore year, if you were in college in engineering you were getting deferred. But, they dropped all that and so I got drafted at the end of my sophomore year, and when you get drafted you can opt for different choices. So, I took a test that the Navy was giving for the RADAR, trying to screen people to go into this new technology. So, as an enlisted man I got to get drafted into the navy and go into their year long training program.</div><br><div>JE: So, your plan sort of worked, you did get yourself ready for RADAR. Now you were in RADAR for a couple years, or?</div><br><div>DE: Well you trained as an electronic technician, which means that you took care of Radios, SONAR, teletype transmission, and RADAR. So that, you were responsible for maintaining their equipment. So it was just one of the enlisted men's ratings.</div><br><div>JE: So, you probably got hands on that you wouldn't have gotten in engineering.</div><br><div>DE: It was just a good training altogether being responsible for, as a technician for maintaining things. For whatever background I've had it was a good introduction into a lot of aspects of technology, wave propagation, antennas, amplifiers all kinds of things. I was sent over to the Philippines and the interesting thing about that is, we were loaded onto the ship in San Francisco Harbor and going to be sent out there to help replace, one of the places in the war that Navy's were taking a lot of casualties was the kami-kazi's were hitting right under the bridge and that was happening to communication centers so, if you were one of the technicians working in there you were wounded. But, anyway's the ship backed out of it's berth and started around San Francisco and we were all up on deck watching things, it was a converted freighter. A bunch of whistles started going off and firecrackers going off and we thought everyone was cheering and we were thinking \"Do they do this for every ship going away\". Then the captain says \"Japan just surrendered.\"</div><br><div>JE: Perfect timing.</div><br><div>DE: Oh boy. So we all started shouting \"Turn around, turn around!\"</div><br><div>JE: So, you still had to go to the Philippines anyway?</div><br><div>DE: Yeah, there was still a lot of stuff to take care of things needed to be demobilized, and y'know.</div><br><div></div><br><div>NACA</div><br><div>JE: Interesting. So then you got out of the Navy, and that was around nineteen forty-six.</div><br><div>DE: Yeah, it was the summer of forty-six so I went right back to Coravallis to join the thousands of other serviceman, G.I.'s and by forty-eight finished...</div><br><div>JE: So, you went back to Coravallis and finished up your degree in electrical engineering.</div><br><div>DE: Spring, of forty-eight and for some reason took a job with the NACA at Haines Laboratory Mountain View, California down in the San Francisco area.</div><br><div>JE: What were they doing?</div><br><div>DE: Well the NACA is the National Aeronautic Commission or something, it was the forerunner of NASA so that became a NASA laboratory. So it's wind tunnels and aeronautic research that was going on. So I was hired as an electrical engineer to work and help make them. So I was working with motors, twenty-five thousand horsepower motors, and all kinds of things.</div><br><div></div><br><div>New Ideas for Computers</div><br><div>JE: That could be fun. But, at some point you discovered the job over at Stanford, is that what happened?</div><br><div>DE: Well what happened was I had been there for two-and-a-half years and in December of fifty I got engaged and that somehow, up till then I was assuming I would just work there, but that just kind of shook me out of some kind of orientation, something made me try to look at what my career was and I realized that I didn't have any more goals and a steady job and getting married and living happily ever after. So, as I explained on the video I overacted and worked over the next three, or four months to see what could a career goal be and by February or March, somewhere in there, I committed to, by saying \"I'm going to commit my career to trying to make it\" let's see \"see how I can maximize my careers contribution to improving mankind's capability for dealing with complexity and urgency.\" Somehow I said the world's getting so complex and everything happening was urgent and our ability to cope with that is not increasing as fast as complexity ad urgency is and that can only spell a higher and higher probability of global disaster if we don't do something and then let me see what I can do. Then I got the image of the way computers could help interactively and the RADAR technician training let me realize easily that a computer could make anything happen on a display screen and engineering anything you do...</div><br><div>JE: Had you worked with computers on any of these jobs?</div><br><div>DE: Oh, no. The nearest working computer was probably in Baltimore. I just read a book, that's how I got this image and I said \"Okay, I commit.\" and that has been the commitment ever since. So what I did then was look for a way to get into that field and at Berkeley they had an O and R project to build a general purpose digital computer and it had been going on for three years or so. Then I went up and entered graduate school there and started learning what there was to know about computers. It wasn't until nineteen fifty-three, I think, when I saw my first working computer.</div><br><div>JE: Was that in the west or did you go east for that?</div><br><div>DE: No, it was at UCLA. The bureau of standards was building computers, so they had...</div><br><div>JE: SWY (?sp?)</div><br><div>DE: Yeah, SWY, Williams two number. Mainframe time to failure, about fifteen minutes, two hundred and fifty words, or something, memory and everyone was so excited. So, can you imagine somebody talking about interactive computer use at that point, y'know, it sounds very unreal.</div><br><div>JE: But, you had a sense of what could happen.</div><br><div>DE: Yeah, I just thought \"Well, it could do that\" and it was clear by then the interest in computers both commercially and military was very, very high so that you knew there would be a lot of development. So, I said \"All right. That looks to me like the best way I could pursue that commitment I made.\" But the strange thing, I finally got my Ph.D. and was teaching.</div><br><div></div><br><div>SRI</div><br><div>JE: At Berkeley?</div><br><div>DE: Yeah, and people kept saying, \"If you keep talking about this kind of professional, no one's doing that, your peers won't except it, there's no place to publish it. You'll be an acting assistant professor for ever.\" So, that's when I decided to go to SRI and in between I tried starting my own company, for about a year. Some of the patents that came out of my Ph.D work... a string of maybe fifteen and I thought that I could get into a business, and if I could make a bunch of money off that then I could do my augmenting. But, by the end of the year I realized that a: semiconductor technology was going to bypass what I'd gotten. I was doing plasma, gas plasma things, so semiconductor plasmas were a lot better. So, I dumped that and applied to SRI thinking if any place in the world could, y'know, I could sell any management someplace about trying to explore this augmenting thing. So, I had to sort of subjugate my interest and go there and start working for a new board and having those patents was such help for keeping SRI. Pretty soon I started generating more patents in what they were working on, magnetic components, and built up sort of enough credibility.</div><br><div>JE: Was this memory, or was this...?</div><br><div>DE: No... a fellow named Hue Krane conceived of ways to cores that had multiple apatures instead of just one, that this very interesting way with a continuing series of driving pulses you could actually store states in them and propagate it down shift registers. It actually had gain and energy so that you had stable plus' and minuses and you could store and move things. I worked in that area for a while then just very about what I really wanted to do. So, finally got a little bit of part-time support for starting to think clearly about this augmenting thing.</div><br><div></div><br><div>Augmenting Human Intellect</div><br><div>JE: So during this period you were trying to sell some of the management at, or whatever level, or your colleagues at Stanford.</div><br><div>DE: SRI could spend some of their internal R and D money they kind of gave themselves , then I got some money from a small airforce office for scientific research in Washington, and there was enough there along with SRI's contribution I could work full time for a couple years and produce what I called, something entitled Augmenting Human Intelectic Conceptual Framework. I sent David, did you see that?</div><br><div>JE: Oh yes. I certainly did see that.</div><br><div>DE: Well, the second thing in there was the report I published on that.</div><br><div>JE: We're going to be looking at that for a long time, there is a lot of stuff in there.</div><br><div>DE: That sixty-two report, I wasn't given enough time to put it together to see what it was and so I was really pitching to try to get support to do that and was applying quite a few places and one of the interesting anecdotes about that is, one of the places I was applying for support, the National Institutes of Mental Health were trying to support computer usage for various kinds of support for thinking or working or something. So, actually sent a sight committee out and they said, \"This all very interesting\" but finally when they assessed it all they said \"Well very interesting proposal about what you want to do but, what you want to do requires quite a bit of sophisticated computer programming and since your way out there in Palo Alto where there isn't any, we don't think it's justified to put our money out there.\"</div><br><div></div><br><div>Enter ARPA</div><br><div>JE: Little did they know.</div><br><div>DE: So it wasn't until opened it's information processing techniques office, JCR and Rip Liner came to do that, and he was talking about manned computer symbioses and timesharing. He said \"Well just out of embarrassment I have got to give this guy money because he's talking about the same kind of thing as me.\" But, I learned from other people some time later that he also felt that way out there, there wasn't much chance but he sort of was forced to give it anyway.</div><br><div>JE: So you cobbled together essentially a group, now this isn't ARC yet is it?</div><br><div>DE: No, see that was just me and there were a few people I was trying to talk with but mostly working on that report was totally solo solitary work and...</div><br><div>JE: Did you meet much resistance as far as just working on the report?</div><br><div>DE: SRI didn't want to spend the money, as soon as I started doing that work, the papers I'd write, the think pieces, people would look at and say \"Gee, we used to think that you were such a clear writer. Look here, you've got twenty pages trying to describe some thing. I look all through that and I can hardly figure out what you're trying to talk about. Now look, here's a one page proposal by Bill over here he describes his problem his approach and all that in one page.\" So, I said \"Well that's really different. Here there aren't even the terms to describe.\" There was enough suspicion in fact which the first money that we started to get they wouldn't even let me be the project manager because they thought y'know \"Look, it's so vague and so...\" So, it wasn't until the second year, I'm not sure that should ever get published.</div><br><div>JE: Not until the second year could you actually get your hands on your own money.</div><br><div>DE: Then the sponsor found out about it and it was just real luck to be able to get support because as it turned out the particular approaches I was taking and the rational behind it weren't shared by not only by the SRI people but by the sponsors that, just parts of it that they came to appreciate or something and some reason or another hung on to give me the support for the years. As it turned out later that there was a big feeling in the research community that I was on the wrong track and that \"Oh the mouse is a cute thing\" and a few things like that, \"Working with displays, yeah that's good but here we're doing it better, now people are going to menus instead, and you're too complex\". So we had things like client server architectures built into it with remote procedure call protocols working and, built into the system and just a lot of architectural things that were, everyone just pictured them as being way too complex.</div><br><div><br>Aumenting Systems</div><br><div>JE: These had fallen out naturally from your vision of what a computer could do for groups of people and they're working to augment their...</div><br><div>DE: That'd be your augmented knowledge workshop and it would be, therefore groups of people and they're all looking through their windows into a common workshop and you would have to have the things like servers and such and such that you could all get access to and electronic mail built into it by nineteen seventy and as I mentioned in there the system called The Journal which, y'know a document gets submitted to that and it's like publishing. Taking that out in the world there are lots of real world applications, it's just a huge winner kind of capability and it's funny the world just hasn't heard that yet or something. But, what we found through the years when we got shut down from the research kind of world in nineteen seventy-six and I actually got removed from my laboratory directorship and they were just going to shut it all down, we convinced them that they should auction, y'know that the system we built was rugged enough to be out in the commercial world, they had the commercial rights so they should try...</div><br><div>JE: Try actually selling it.</div><br><div>DE: So, after three months of...</div><br><div>JE: This is the augment system.</div><br><div>DE: Yeah, and Tymshare happened to be the winning bidder and it was a steal. They're the ones that we named it augment.</div><br><div>JE: I see. What had you called it?</div><br><div>DE: NLS.</div><br><div></div><br><div>On to Xerox PARC</div><br><div>JE: Oh yeah, NLS, that's right. Online system.</div><br><div>DE: So, quite a few of our people, a few of them had already gone over to work at socks parks when it started in seventy-one or something like that and they sort of made it clear that they were interested in almost any of our central guys who could come over. So that when this close down started it was just a real mass exodus over there. But, Tymshare when they bought the system needed some people to operate it and they said \"Well, we'll take any of the crew that wants to come.\" So, I showed up with it. The perception that they had picked up from SRI was that I was off the beam, not to be trusted. So it turned out they wouldn't even let me talk to customers.</div><br><div></div><br><div>Tired Approaches Towards Computers</div><br><div>JE: That's funny because they bid essentially on the system and the group and so forth, and you had created it. Very strange, people are odd.</div><br><div>DE: Well, we're all wrong like that it's the way our...as I mentioned there the paradigm people operate on what there assumptions are a lot of them unexamined assumptions about how things are and where they're going, that it's a time of change that's faster than paradigms are shifting so, what are computers for etcetera. Still the biggest impediment for me is that my perception and vision of what the technology can mean when we learn how to integrate it into our organizations and life and how much will change in order to harness it, has just consistently been much different from other peoples...</div><br><div>JE: Well that certainly is true, I love the, I think it was in, I read quite a few articles and one of them either about you or that you wrote quotes a colleague of yours saying he wouldn't know what to do if the response was faster than twenty minutes.</div><br><div>DE: Yeah, that was the guy that started computer science at Stanford.</div><br><div>JE: So just a total sort of batch mode mind set.</div><br><div>DE: Yeah that's right and the other was \"What, use a computer just for editing\" and I said \"No, wait a minute, when your on-line there's a lot more you can do. While your there why don't you get the computer to help you with all these other little things.\" and they'd laugh \"You mean automatic line-wrap\" and they would just laugh. \"You want to use a whole computer just to do that?\" and I said \"No, it's your whole vehicle of working so while you're there look at all the things it can do for you.\"</div><br><div></div><br><div>New Paradigms</div><br><div>JE: You had thought about interfaces, I take it, very early. In the sense that it's really through workable interfaces that you get to the machine that can augment your work, I mean if you had a bad interface how could you augment, your intelligence and your capacity for work. So, I suppose that's where your were thinking about things like word-wrap, full screen editing, all of that.</div><br><div>DE: And more. You know, it's the interface between a human and this whole augmentation system, which is so much more than just the technology, it's all of what I call the human system and y'know the clothes we wear, the facilities we have, the language we employ, the methods, the conventions, the customs. All of those things are things we've had to learn and interface with. So, you're interfacing with a lot more than just your pencil or something. And so, look as all that changes we can consider... Do you know what matching impedances is?</div><br><div>JE: Mmm-hmm</div><br><div>DE: Right, it's like saying \"Hey, look you've got machinery in here, metal machinery and all kinds of motor sensory machinery that can do terrific things, \"I can ride a bicycle backwards\" people skateboarding all of that stuff, things that y'know we didn't think natively we were evolved to be able to do, so what makes you think that the conventions for externalizing our symbols or communicating or manipulating them in any way are an optimum match to our basic mental motor sensory capabilities. That whole interface can change the very language and the very structure and the very modes we portray our symbols and communicate and think. They could totally look for redesigning to make a better match and we never had the opportunity like that. So we think that that's the way knowledge, the hard copy is the way knowledge goes and people still are armed with \"Hey, desk-top publishing and whizzi-wig is the way to go\" and I kept saying \"That was the way but don't stay anchored with that look at the options\" and so the whole thing about hypertext and structured and all the optual views we built into the system and the way in which you also stay oriented about where you are in that knowledge space and all the optual ways in which you can get to other places, or reach to other objects on there to manipulate them. People all do the point and drag stuff as that's the way to do it, well that's a new way to do it but if that's the only way you're missing a tremendous amount.</div><br><div></div><br><div>Combining Chords</div><br><div>JE: I noticed that your involved with or had designed or at least worked with a number of input devices besides the mouse. There were several keyboards that worked on the principle of combinations of...</div><br><div>DE: Chords.</div><br><div>JE: Yeah, chords and that kind of thing.</div><br><div>DE: Yeah that was distinctly, I had to force that in to that. That was part of it and the two together, we demonstrated that in sixty-eight but people just out of hand rejected that keyset thing</div><br><div>(Break in tape)</div><br><div></div><br><div>New Ideas/Old Traditions</div><br><div>JE: Yeah, for the tape I was just saying that your, the interfaces that you created for that nineteen sixty-eight demonstration, IEEE was it?</div><br><div>DE: No, it was the fall Joint Computer Conference. They had two a year and that was the two computer conferences.</div><br><div>JE: Right. And that interface still looked good when I first saw it in the nineteen eighties so it must have been a real revelation in nineteen sixty-eight if not a total shock but you were saying the reaction was kind of mixed or?</div><br><div>DE: Well it really seemed to build a lot of excitement or something like that but the strangest part about that was we thought that during the next year we would see a lot of interest in pursuing that it was almost as though it didn't relate to the real world there would be people who'd come by and see demonstrations and say \"Wow\". But I began to realize over the following years that somehow it didn't connect with their perception of their own future. Y'know it's as if you'd gone to some laboratory and seen some people strap things on their backs that let them levitate and move around and \"Oh that's all very interesting but that has nothing to do with my own future\".</div><br><div>JE: Gosh, that is surprising, I must say. It's very hard for people to see, myself included.</div><br><div>DE: Well this is one of the biggest single problems. I keep saying that the perception people have of the future, of what it's potential is, of what there is to do about it etcetera, is the biggest single problem in mankind's ability in the future to harness technology and really take advantage of it...</div><br><div>(End side 1)</div><br><div>JE: ...implicit assumption that's not examined.</div><br><div>DE: That the large parts of our world that are being taken for granted and they're not being examined ever or being considered as candidates for change, for explicit planned change. And yet the rapidity with which really dramatic scale changes are occurring in what the capabilities of technology are, are such that by the time that really gets integrated into the whole, our whole social human system there's a lot of adaptation to be made. That's why we were talking about this, how you match impedances really with</div><br><div>JE: Yes, and the impedance of computers personal computers actually if you think about it is still rather high, I mean computers are still really too hard to use.</div><br><div>DE: But when I talk about matching impedances it's sort of...</div><br><div>JE: To get resonance.</div><br><div>DE: To get the maximum transfer of power is what impedance matching is all about so the maximum transfer of knowledge and directed capability and as a matter of fact that hard to use thing is just, that's another image which you'd say \"Alright, okay Jon you have to reexamine your own paradigm there\".</div><br><div>JE: And adjust it to the computer.</div><br><div>DE: No, adjust it to what it is that will let you best harness the computer. I make analogies like in automobile world or something like that if you'd ask people in nineteen ten when you could still buy different kinds of cars from people what their perception would be of how it was all going to get integrated into our world and they'd never have conceived of how much complexity there is in all you have to know in order to ...</div><br><div>JE: That's right in one of the articles here. It's a good analogy of all the skills you would need to keep the thing going down the road</div><br><div>DE: And another thing I point out is if you get these self propelled wheeled vehicles that make an interesting way to get around if that easy to use kind of picture was there everybody would still be riding tricycles cause a bicycle is just something that's totally more difficult. There's no natural way to think about riding a bicycle in fact most people don't even know what it is their body is automatically doing in order to ride a bicycle.</div><br><div></div><br><div>ETLANTU</div><br><div>JE: Now what is the acronym that you developed ETLANTU or something. Easy To Learn And...</div><br><div>DE: Natural To Use.</div><br><div>JE: Natural To Use, right, yes.</div><br><div>DE: So anyway that's, I finally made a paradigm map. Twelve or thirteen boxes around a sort of a loop. If you start out thinking a serious objective make organizations much more capable of coping now I call it boosting their collective IQ's. The different stages in the way I thought about it and developed the approach in which there are really different ways of thinking that sort of have to be admitted to the dialog in order for me to say \"There's the picture\".</div><br><div></div><br><div>Outline Processors</div><br><div>JE: Y'know one thing did bother me a little bit when you were talking about, or one of the articles was talking about this and that is many of your concepts have made the computer easier to use. The famous ones are the interface devices or conceptual devices. So you see this as sort of a two way two agent street that is that people should work to develop the skills that allow them the best impedance matching and the computer also we have to do things with the computers to try to aid that matching is that sort of the idea.</div><br><div>DE: Right, I can outline processor y'know it's really sort of a way in that which people can do well at trying to get things organized in the hierarchy and the outline processor really helps as you learn how to use it. But it's a, y'know that's an unnatural, we've never had that sort of thing before but why avoid it because it's different. Cause I remember one of the best software guys that came and worked for me just like this he says \"I don't think that way and your not gonna make me start.\" and I said \"Okay\". But, you work there a while and you very quietly start realizing how easy it is to tuck these things down and rearrange it and then when he started doing his programming that way he just became a convert.</div><br><div>JE: I don't know if I understand the outline processor concept as well as I'd like to. I use the outliner in Microsoft Word a lot, I mean I do a lot of outlining before I write is that the sort of thing that your thinking about. So the say Microsoft Word outline features is sort of an outline processor.</div><br><div>DE: Yeah it's sort of like saying why wasn't that introduced at the outset in word processors. See we were trying to, that was part of the sixty-eight thing and part of our system from the beginning. Y'know you specifically establish that in your document. Another paradigm issue is what's a document and as long as the orientation is that a document is this printed thing then what you have in the computer is just getting ready for it and is whizzi-wig. So if you start using an outline processor and start folding things etcetera and different views then your sort of shifting away from the normal.Well way back there we said externilizing your concepts and your symbols outside has been one way that technology's from ppapyrus on up, we get use to that there's a lot of conventions for doing that. Well if we externalize them into this other medium of which were going to work then there are just a lot more options for the way in which that can make a better map of what's in your head. That's what led me directly, thinking like that it was just like \"Oh, jesus\". The computer can show all sorts of relationships that you can't show on paper and so why not, and the computer help you get that there and get that structure relationships and he;lp you view it and help you move around, so why not.</div><br><div></div><br><div>Management Organization and Transformation</div><br><div>JE: The sixty-eight presentation is that, do you see that as one of the high points or the high point of the work you were doing at SRI, or was that just another station along the way?</div><br><div>DE: What we had to show by then was just along the way and y'know every year after that more and more was added and then the experience of working with organizations out there and getting more and more clear about how much shift there would be and actually more respect for the complexity of changing organizations and learning pragmatically about all of the very natural impediments to bring it in. But,nobody that's serious about working on his job was ever sort of indoctrinated into his career role or something with the orientation of how much change that'd be coming about, so to introduce that and to have people suddenly think that \"God, I've worked this long to become a manager of this etcetera like that and suddenly your expecting me to move into a different working mode etcetera in which, hell, in the first place I'll look stupid and I don't have as much time as the younger guys do to change and what happens to me?\" so he says \"Oh, you gotta start, you have to provide for a lot of the very natural things.\"</div><br><div>JE: It's fascinating you've been saying this really since the sixties and yet it's been very hard for large organizations to really incorporate that into their actions because the greatest, over the years through the late seventies and eighties the greatest complaint on heard was that organizations were not spending enough time really thinking about the effects of this change that your talking about here so it must have been just as hard for the top management to get thinking about this as it is for the kinds of people your describing to actually make the shift.</div><br><div>DE: The job and working environment for the top management is going to change a great deal too.</div><br><div>JE: I imagine that they are going to resist that.</div><br><div>DE: Who that they feel understands their world is going to them a different world. Y'know the consultants that are out there that talk about high level strategies and management in organizations they're not oriented yet for the change that's coming. Indeed who's responsible for mapping that future, that's the kind of thing we got into in the video and the change in the organizations is something that has just always happened really slowly and organically and the opportunity now for terrific change to gain terrific advantages is there but there is no precedent for making that conversion rapidly there aren't the processes, there aren't the improvement processes there, there aren't the ways,... I've got, some of my slides, if I talk about what I call the tool system is all the technologies that we apply, hardware and software and the human system is all the conventions and methods and all of that and I sort of laid it out in a two-dimensional plane and I say we're down here near the origin of that two-dimensional thing now that there all these technologies we can anticipate tremendous sort of things. Huge band with wireless things always with us connected to any kind of databases anyplace in the world high speed networks. And the other dimension is all of the changes that are possible in your organizational and human system so someway your not just going to go puttering along that x-axis because you can't really take advantage of that without the other. So, what is your path going to be out into that two-dimensional space and where are you going to end up settling best in five years and twenty years etcetera, nobody's explored that space to be able to tell you. So, who can tell you if your the guy to decide for some big organization, where your going to be and how to get there most effectively. There's no exploration in that space, you can't do it in a university you've got to do it with real world outposts.</div><br><div></div><br><div>Boot-strap Work</div><br><div>JE: Now is that the main focus of the boot-strap work?</div><br><div>DE: Yeah, the main focus of bootstrap is to say \"given that, what's the best strategy for getting organizations out there and what's a really pragmatic evolutionary approach, and that's the bootstrapping thing so that it ends up saying there's a particular kind of consortion that you can make with organizations that can be the same kind but it's almost better if they're a different kind. At the outset you'd be expecting them not to make great big investments so half a million a year for the first couple years among six to ten of them would get a great start and in the process there as you start reclarifying what we call the improvement infrastructure and that this consortion becomes an integral part of that improvement infrastructure and that it's relationship with the other organizations gets really dynamic and working and bonding it's not like a consortion where you send your money to some central place your people are in and out and in the consortion your making that the first level most advanced outpost you can and it's got a very explicit purposeful set of capabilities it's going to enhance and in a way in a networked way they can start really using that network collaboration to facilitate the improvement process of every organization directly.</div><br><div>JE: Now as I understand it you've tried to do this in some private programs in your own organization, is that right? Or, have you been able to get pilot programs started in other organizations?</div><br><div>DE: Well, over the years up until eighty-eight or so, the Tymshare activity and the later the McDonnell Douglas and in some of the customer they have quite a few pilot operations there that taught us a lot but they were never structured in this same boot-strapping way but they teach you a great deal anyway. We're trying now to, y'know we've been trying to get this consortion started and it looks like it's beginning to make headway but it's the kind of the thing where it's very clear if you watch the inside of any busy barge or organization you realize that there isn't a decision point in there where the person who has to make some of these decisions about that has a chance to get the experience and the assurance that they can stick money in the, that's farther out.</div><br><div>JE: You'd have to make it kind of cold, right?</div><br><div>DE: What we're trying to do is sort of boot-strap that. It's sort of like keep it at a relatively modest, y'know half-a-million a year is not a very big deal once they sort of feel like getting ready. It's gotten to be a big deal in the last couple of years when everybody is downsizing and cutting cost...</div><br><div>JE: Oh, right, yeah.</div><br><div>DE: and it's gotten to a really dangerous extent.</div><br><div>JE: Well it acquires a momentum all it's own and people begin downsizing and the word has been applied dumbsizing, y'know just for the sake of doing it.</div><br><div>DE: Well down in costcutting and that everything is too, unfortunately we've got to watch this next quarter so that we don't have any long term. So, part of our strategy is just saying look whatever you do have y'know there's going to be a lot of change and some are going to survive and others aren't, who's going to come out on top? and he says \"Whatever you do have to invest in this improving and changing you better have the best strategy you can for that investment\" and that's what we're offering.</div><br><div></div><br><div>Dividing Time</div><br><div>JE: In your Tymshare period and then McDonnell Douglas buy's out Tymshare right and was there a large change between Tymshare and McDonnell Douglas or, I mean were you able to flow your work from Tymshare to the McDonnell Douglas work fairly easily?</div><br><div>DE: In the first place I have to describe that the operation of the business of selling augment services etcetera through Tymnet and Opernet was something that I wasn't in, that they kept me off to the side. So, I couldn't influence it very much. But, the business side of it wouldn't let me talk to the customers. It became quite clear that it was an explicit shielding. For one because they said they knew the timesharing business and \"if you start involving customers the main thing they'll do is start wanting the system changed and you'll have to spend more and more on system changes\" and we said \"Yeah but if there's this much transition going to come about then they need to be involved.\" \"I don't know, we know better than you, you guys come from this ivory tower stuff\". But when McDonnell Douglas took over there wasn't a direct link between aerospace side of it, but I could go commute to St. Louis and start talking to aerospace people and there with groups that were involved in thinking about the corporate architectures for the information systems and trying to improve capabilities etcetera</div><br><div>JE: And you had access to it?</div><br><div>DE: Right, but to get that I had to actually shift my organizational to whom I was attached to some person who ran a small office in the regular aerospace in St. Louis, who I actually never met who said \"Alright, we can put you here as long as the funding comes\" so another group say's \"We'll give him the funding\" and this guy says \"I don't even have the time to give you reviews\" \"Well, okay, this will only be a year or so\"</div><br><div>JE: That might be alright.</div><br><div>DE: No, I meant that you didn't get any salary increases.</div><br><div>JE: Oh.</div><br><div>DE: So, I had to go through that for about four years or so.</div><br><div>JE: I thought you were talking about program reviews, sometimes if they don't do anything they sort of keep hands off you, which has some advantages.</div><br><div>DE: Well that part was all just trying to build it up so we, anyway it was just very instructive being inside a big organization like that, of trying, trying to see how some of the successful executives were extremely risk aversion y'know where they're not really going to stick there necks out at all because if you do anything that people can chip away at you about you lose position.</div><br><div></div><br><div>Exodus to Xerox PARC (Revisited)</div><br><div>JE: Yes, that may have been one of the factors involved in the problems that Xerox had in not being able to get (?Alto?) out the door. You mentioned that a number of your SRI people went to Xerox PARC, sort of when it started, around seventy-one you think.</div><br><div>DE: Well a few of them went over early and the real move came around seventy-six when they started saying,... it was obvious that our program was feeling we weren't going the right direction and was starting to pull it's support and SRI actually put someone else in charge of my lab who had very different perception, very, very different about it. So, just within weeks people started trotting down the street to park. So, they ended up with like fourteen of them.</div><br><div>JE: There was no formal connection between your lab at SRI and Xerox Park, there was a real sort of people connection I take it.</div><br><div>DE: The majority of the people brought into park were people hired from the university (Standford - ed.) and Bob Taylor who was hired early had been a director at ARPA of the information processing office so he knew all the people etcetera and pulled them together. So, a large part all knew at least knew the names. And then when park first started up they didn't have any computers so some of those people would come over to our lab and hang out and use NLS and we actually started a joint developmental language.</div><br><div></div><br><div>NLS and the Alto</div><br><div>JE: A number of the features of the Alto certainly reflect your idea's and in fact that's a remarkable machine, when I take people through our exhibit I will ask them to guess how old this machine is, we have the Alto and I show them the mouse and we have a simulated screen and so forth, and nobody guess' seventy-three. So, I presume that Sort of happened because of the people who went over there.</div><br><div>DE: I don't really know. Y'know I didn't get invited to come be a part of that and the people that went over would tell me that the people were taking the mouse and some of the things like that but for some reason there's an antipathy, an explicit antipathy about NLS that basically people aren't accepting it as a place to go from.</div><br><div>JE: It's clear that you were way ahead in thinking about the possibilities for groupware and that kind of thing, which looked to me essentially as though it were built in NLS very early on. It looks as though they took sort of specific pieces of, specific concepts and so forth but, not the sort of larger data concepts and networking concepts and that kind of thing although I guess that, if I recall, that the Alto was on some sort of a network...</div><br><div>DE: But it wasn't shared stuff.</div><br><div>JE: Yeah, it wasn't really shared.</div><br><div></div><br><div>Frustrations</div><br><div>DE: When they were building the, there was the next big system...</div><br><div>JE: Star.</div><br><div>DE: Star, yeah. So, that was definitely a networked thing and there were four of the activities, the applications, the network system, the hardware, and operating system, I don't know but four of the guys from my lab headed each of those parts of that thing so there were more in the pursuit of the remote procedure called protocol, they published an early one, the guy who wrote that had been in our lab too and I called him up later and said \"Gee, how big a subset of our remote procedure called protocol that we actually built into our system, how large a part of yours did we actually have?\". He said \"Actually it's the other way around, we published you as only a subset of what we built\". There was very little communication that I just somehow didn't feel welcome and whether it's my own problem or what. I went over there a couple of times to visit but people were always showing me what they were doing and it was in a sense almost like \"See this is the real way to go\" and I remember I went over and they showed me the electronic mail they were getting, as though it was a brand new deal and it didn't have the functionality that we had had since seventy. So, it just made me, I don't know, I was having a hard time.</div><br><div>JE: Well there was, I tell ya that time when there were conditions at SRI that were problematic for you, you said that was part of the reason your people went over there, over to park.</div><br><div>DE: In seventy-six, in the fall sort of a terrific jolt by telling me \"Well, we want to get your lab going in the right direction and such so we're replacing you as director\" y'know that was a horrible jolt. That came about a month and a half after my house had burned down. Boy, pretty bad year.</div><br><div>JE: Yes, I would think so, especially the frustration, as you say in one of your articles of knowing that because of the delay, the house really got going, the fire really got going and if you had been three minutes instead of six minutes, y'know, it could have made a huge difference.</div><br><div>DE: I didn't know that ever got into print.</div><br><div>JE: Well it's in there, I think it's in one of your, if not it's in one of the interviews, but it was very interesting.</div><br><div></div><br><div>The Outsider</div><br><div>DE: So, anyway it's sort of like the house ran into so many problems, financial ones, cause y'know it's been a rough financial thing through all these years too and so it wasn't until late last summer we finally got the final inspection finally to get our house back together, just what it does to your social life, and family. Then career wise it's like I've been in Siberia since then trying from the outside, I'm not part of the world anymore I don't belong to any organization, I'm not in any funded channel for research, it's an outsider.</div><br><div>JE: And yet it is curious but it seems true that since eighty-seven even though you were famous in the business, I mean I first read about back in either the late seventies or early eighties there was an article on the mouse but there was more on you than just the mouse. We knew about you when we started the show and we're determined to get something about, so and yet the sort of honors are starting to really come in post eighty-seven, it's very curious you must have been the most famous person in the business that</div>",

From the Table of Contents: <br>\"Can digital technology make a better world? Improve our collective IQ? In the dreams of this  visionary inventor it can.\" </div><br><div>Photo of Doug in his home by David Toerge 1995<br>COMMENTARY :: Douglas Engelbart<br>for BYTE magazine</div><br><div>Digital technology could help make this a better world. But we've also got to change our way of thinking.</div><br><div>Despite the rapid progression of computing technology, the world faces incredible hazards as we enter a common economic-political vehicle, traveling at an ever-accelerating pace through increasingly complex terrain. Our headlights are much too dim and blurry, and we have totally inadequate steering and braking controls.</div><br><div>Many years ago, I dreamed that digital technology could greatly augment our collective human capabilities for dealing with complex, urgent problems. Computers, high-speed communications, displays, interfaces \ufffd it's as if suddenly, in an evolutionary sense, we're getting a super new nervous system to upgrade our collective social organisms. I dreamed that people were talking seriously about the potential of harnessing that technological and social nervous system to improve the collective IQ of our various organizations.</div><br><div>Then I dreamed that we got strategic and began to form cooperative alliances of organizations, employing advanced networked computer tools and methods to develop and apply new collective knowledge. Call these alliances NICs (Networked Improvement Communities). This seemed eminently sensible. The new technologies could enable much more effective distributed collaboration, and the potential for shared risk and multiplied benefits seemed promising.</div><br><div>In the dream, the solution involves giving high priority to the collective capability for a distributed community (or organization) to develop, integrate, and apply new knowledge. We already had this capability, of course; organizations handle new collective problems all the time. But yes, it would be nice if we could be a lot more effective at it. In the dream, this collaborative capability was called CoDIAK, for Concurrent Development, Integration, and Application of Knowledge.</div><br><div>Sounds great. The better we get, the better we get at getting better. Call it bootstrapping. And just think of the important role for technologists.</div><br><div>Although exciting new technology innovations have indeed been introduced within the NICs, the technology efforts have been overshadowed by the concurrent efforts in \"human-system\" innovation. This includes new skills, methods, collaborative organizational structures, telecommuting, knowledge-worker teams, distributed goal setting, planning and management processes.</div><br><div>One of the ideas computer-oriented folks have contributed is the open hyperdocument system. For this to make a difference, we must shed our outdated concept of a document. We need to think in terms of flexible jumping and viewing options. The objects assembled into a document should be dealt with explicitly as representaions of kernel concepts in the authors' minds, and explicit structuring options have to be utilized to provide a much enhanced mapping of the source concept structures.</div><br><div>The Web/HTML ( Hypertext Markup Language) publishing-browsing landslide has moved steadily toward a highly structured, object-oriented architecture with integrated editor-browser tool sets. But his needs to become the way the majority of people do all their work. Draft notes, E-mail, plans, source code, to-do lists, what have you \ufffd all can be hyperdocument pieces, instantly and intrinsically linkable, and with work processes involving fewer and fewer hard-copy printouts.</div><br><div>It has been exciting to watch the emergence of total-quality management, process reengineering, NII (National Information Infrastructure), the World Wide Web, and so forth. But it pains me that we haven't yet put up an explicit CoDIAK target, nor explored how NICs could fly. Since the first of these dreams got fixed in my head, decades ago, I've struggled with the realization that the sooner the world gets serious about pursuing the possibilities, the greater the chance that we can reduce the hazards facing this careening vessel carrying us along.</div><br><div>If the dream of improving human destiny doesn't move people, how about the thought that the companies that adopt the best CoDIAK-improvement strategy will have a significant competitive advantage. Wouldn't you want your group to have the highest collective IQ?</div><br><div>I confess that l am a dreamer. Someone once called me \"just a dreamer.\" That offended me, the \"just\" part; being a real dreamer is hard work. It really gets hard when you start believing in your dreams.</div>",

        "full": "<div>Speaker:\tStart the introduction. I thought I was, Robert. Ready? Thank you. Doug did his work with his colleagues on the online system at SRI, but their work enormously influenced what happened in the early '80s at Xerox [inaudible 00:00:24] research center. That, as we know, led to things like Lisa and Mac at Apple, which in turn led to Windows at Microsoft and so on. There's an enormously visible trail from Doug to our industry as it exists today. I hold him and his group personally responsible in the good sense, I want you to know, for building augmentation systems to do outline and hypermedia editing. A very fancy kind.</div><br><div>\tFor computer-supported collaborative work. For inventing the mouse and 2-handed input and TV display technology. All in the '60s, folks. I want you to remember when this was all happening. His was also the shop that I came to that for the first time, really made it clear what the power of good software engineering could be. They wrote meta-assemblers and meta-compilers and all manners of tools to help them build tools to make good things for end users. </div><br><div>\tHe also thought about how tool-building should help the end user. He thought about the process of introducing new tools and how processes must change in the organization. How the organization itself had to evolve to make use of the tool. Got us familiar with the term bootstrapping, bootstrap institute, bootstrapping yourself and your organization.</div><br><div>\tHe and his people put on what is still today in my mind, and other people who remember it, the mother of all demos. It is still unsurpassed. It happened at the Fall Joint Computer Conference. It was beyond leading edge and it came off beautifully. We're going to be privileged to see a little footage from that in a moment. </div><br><div>\tFinally, very personally, after I learned about him I was privileged to spend a couple of days in his lab, stealing his best ideas and implementing it, many of them in our next hypertech system called [inaudible 00:02:22] in the late '60s. Doug, it's a thrill for me to welcome you here.</div><br><div>Doug:\tMichael. [inaudible 00:02:35] Thank you very much. This is a real treat and definitely a little bit a wash in trying to tell what I'd like to tell as something that fits into the Bush picture. I think the best thing I can do is go sit down and start giving a presentation. One thing though I can tell you is my first introduction to the Bush thing happened just slightly less than 50 years ago. Maybe 3 or 4 weeks less than that, that there was a young sailor boy that was plunked down on an island in the Philippines to [inaudible 00:03:24] to some local area, work. He was an electronic technician. He'd been 2 years of electronic technician training and shipped out and very interestingly that just as his ship was backing out and steaming around the San Francisco Bay to go out, there were many, many whistles and toots and everything else. </div><br><div>\tWe thought, \"Gee, do they celebrate everybody leaving that way?\" Turned out that was VJ Day. 68 days later at 8 knots, we got out to the Philippines, etc. In waiting around for a week or something like that, in that camp right part of the jungle, I wandered around one day and I found this Philippine hut. They really are up on stilts and animals live underneath. It was all nice and clean. It said, \"Red Cross Library,\" so I climbed a little ladder. It was a very pleasant room in there. About 20 feet on its side and it actually was a very nicely outfitted little library. With thousands of marines and sailors around like that, there wasn't a single other person in it. <br>\tI spent many hours in it. If I found that Life Magazine article on Bush, and I always remember, it was very exciting to see that. I'd have enough technical training by then to look at it and think about it, etc. It didn't become an impact thing that drove me the rest of time. What I'd like to do is go sit down here now and tell you the stories of what to me the potential is and I would very, very much to have been able to work with Bush and talk to him. </div><br><div>\tI tried once sending him a letter and an outline draft I'd made. I didn't hear back from him. This was in 1962. Somebody had told me that he's already so old and he really was in a rest home or something and probably wasn't returning. Turns out he lived another 12 years and published books, etc. I wasn't aware of that then. One of the things that you have to realize is living way out there in the [inaudible 00:05:45] area, you tend to feel that MIT was the center of the universe then.</div><br><div>\tThen just to prove it that I'd worked for years by 1962, '63. Really, the push started in 1951 about committing a career to trying to do the most to help humans cope better with complexity and urgency. Computers and interactive use was the idea that came to my mind. I actually envisioned how that would work. That engineering training and the technology and the radar made me realize that anything a computer, if it could punch cards and could print on paper, it could create any kind of image you wanted on a screen.</div><br><div>\tIt could interact with humans easily, easily interact, etc. I just pictured it working interactive. Of course. This is a very naive country boy, you understand, that is still a country boy. Anyway, so I says, \"All right, there's a direction. I'll go back to graduate school.\" Berkeley had a research program in computers. They had [one 00:06:54] our contract to build one. I got my PhD 5 years later or something. It still wasn't working by then. </div><br><div>\tAnyway, the first computer conference I went to was down at UCLA in 1953 I guess. Practically I was that year's computer conference. I think there was 65 people there. Lector hall in UCLA. If you think back in the history of things like that, you have to realize the emergence, very slowly of something the rest of the world wasn't paying much attention to. It was a cost of things relative to salaries, etc. was much higher than it is now.</div><br><div>\tAnyway for me, that pursuit of saying, \"What can you do to help work with complexion urgency?\" Which the real problems humanity faces, those are collective problems. From the beginning, it was the collective capability of people to cope better. After, I don't have time to go into all of the odyssey through the years but I SRI until 1977. Then SRI sold rights to the SAML system out in the commercial world. Otherwise we lost our research and they were money and they were going to dismantle it so we got a chance to take it out, some of us. The rest of the people went to Xerox PARC.</div><br><div>\tWe lived in the commercial world selling the service of this system out to TymNet and ARPANET. A lot of pilots, it was built to support people and work. Then McDonald Douglas bought the Tymshare and TymNet in 1984 which gave me the opportunity to go knocking on the doors of this heavy, industrial domain. Talking about the kind of things that I'd been wanting to do for a long time and had built. It was very interesting that the architecture's that we'd evolved were the first thing that appealed to them.</div><br><div>\tIt's essentially a very sturdy prototype of the client-server model with very special ways in which you could deal with ... variable classes of work stations. Variable classes of users looking into the same work domain. Then they got interested in the hyperstructure of [inaudible 00:09:28] things too. That just opened people's eyes immensely. During all that time, we built a system to use it and it evolved into constant, heavy use to do all of our work. By the time we'd gone out and worked with other organizations and seen what happens when you introduce things like that, and get people to adapt themselves to use it, our image about the problems that challenges a potential requirements, etc. grew to be somewhat different from the rest of the hypertext world which was a problem in itself. It made it harder to be part of that world.</div><br><div>\tAnyway, in 1989 my daughter, Christina and I formed Bootstrap Institute, saying, \"The real need here is a strategy for how the world can really go after the potential of boosting its collective, problem-solving capability.\" It began using the term collective IQ in a very real sense. The presentation here is all built around these boxes about 8 or 10 of them are paradigm issues of some significance. Had it had occurred to me after quite a few years that to walk up cold to people and start telling them the potential that was there and the path to go after it, we had a great deal of problem because of the ways our minds get fixed about certain things.</div><br><div>\tWe grow up in an environment and we just take much for granted. These paradigms are the important ones. In this presentation, I can just go highlight any of these boxes in this way. I have also the option of saying, \"Show me a brief little subtitle under it.\" I'll march through the subtitles in the orientation and then dive down underneath some of these boxes more deeply to give them a presentation. </div><br><div>\tThe way we're characterizing the objective here really is high-performance organizations. That means the ability to cope with complexity, etc. whether it's developing new products or coping with national issues. If you're going to make a really different in that, it became apparent very early in my studies by the early '60s that you had to deal with the whole capability infrastructure of an organization. Not just think you can make some high-level capability, improve a lot by some veneer, layer-thick, new technology.</div><br><div>\tIn fact, it was really all study that you realize that of all the technology you bring in it, joins the ranks of a lot of artifacts and tools through all the centuries. Anyone of which being introduced, if it's any significance, makes a difference in human organization, structure, conventions. A lot of things there. The real thing is the whole that augments the native human capability is the mix of these. Both in a coherent system. The focus on tools alone, if you're going to talk about very significant improvements in the technology that focuses not enough to just on that.</div><br><div>\tWe'll go into more of that later. Then the need for a pragmatic way in which both sides of those are going to co-evolve. The human system side is just evolved organically through all the centuries without my explicit attention. When the technology started erupting in the Western world, with explicit focus on it, etc. then it that was driving the world and the rest of it followed. </div><br><div>\tOne says that's going to be very complex issue and problems. If we're going to invest a lot in evolving our organizations, etc., it'd be nice instead of step by step by step investments if we'd had some way to invest in a change that compounded. There would be a huge, social investment really in this change. The technology side of it may only be 10 or 15% of the total cost, if that much.</div><br><div>\tHow do you want the best strategy, etc. like that? Do you want a criteria for investing? Yes. The whole set of them. What came out of this in the end is it'd be very important to make, pay attention to the infrastructure of the way our improvement process and change processes work. Which is a very haphazard way as it is now. Turns out that if you're looking for the most pay-off investment criteria, that paying attention to the improvement infrastructure gives you a real chance to get ahold of a strategy. Out of that comes a strategy of saying, \"Look, if you're going to improve the end-capability, for instance in product cycle time, if you also can at the same time be trying to use some of the similar capabilities that you're going to improve. To improve your improvement process. You'll really start bootstrapping.\"<br>\tThat's the basic thing. Diagrams I had in my 1962 paper, etc. like that were full of all that feedback between elements and such. Realizing that so it turns out that this kind of collective knowledge work that concurrently developing, integrating and applying knowledge in any collective sense is real key to that. It's an extremely part end-product for organizations to have improve. If you do get some of this going in small groups even and a high level of new capability in that, you can plug that into the improvement cycle to accelerate it. <br>\tThat's the thing. That's why we call it bootstrapping. Improving your improvement process, taking yourself up by the bootstraps. That's a strategy we're trying to tell the world about. The old guy is still pushing like crazy. Paraphrasing. Then you find out if whatever technologies or capabilities you're bringing in there, they have to have to essentially global interoperability that this is really going to be a collective thing. </div><br><div>\tThe conventions that they were showing about in documents about footnotes, how you cross-reference things, make indices, table of contents, those are conventions that go along with the technology of the time. You bring in a brand new technology and there's a new set of conventions that you want to adopt to take advantage of those. Those, in turn, are dependent upon the structure and conventions by the electronic form of the documents.</div><br><div>\tThose have to grow into something globally interoperable. As they get those standards, they don't want to be derived by shallow sort of potential uses. There's a very deep, very broad, very high performance in the end. Collective capability you've got to pay attention to. The pursuit of something called an open, hyperdocument system under there is a very, very high order business to be attending to. <br>\tWe say, \"And how should that be done?\" It really needs to be done in a pursuit that's working towards this goal. Very interesting item here becomes how do you start best deploying early gains? Down there you realize early gains aren't necessarily going to be the most pay-off if you try to bring everybody in the organization up. If you can bring special teams of people up, well you really explore the potential. They have a role in the organization as it is now. There's a lot of reasons that from our experience. This may not be one of the high pay-off things to consider.</div><br><div>\tYou had choices all the way along of what you improve and where you invest the actual improvement capabilities that you've gotten. In the end, it comes out to be a networked improvement community. Strategically an extremely important thing. That you get a community of people trying, that they're going to share the improvement pursuit within that community. You get them connected to a network and you give them these new capabilities so that they can cooperate upon that improvement process. That says, \"Great.\" Especially if you want to say, \"Hey well what about the pursuit of this Kodiak stuff? Why not do that in this same sense as the improvement community?\"</div><br><div>\tAt the same time you're really pushing the best open hyperdocument system potential you can. That seemed like a glorious potential thing to do that that's why we started the bootstrapping. To say to people, \"Look, there really is something there we can go after.\" The company that learns best to do this is going to be ahead. The country that learns best how to go after this is going to come out ahead. Maybe even mankind. How much will it impact the chances of survival of a human race that so far, isn't paying much attention to keeping its world something that is a long time survival environment?</div><br><div>\tThe social problems, economic problems, political issues and problems, psychological ones, many kind of issues there are really severe. They're put to test our collective capability. Which if you look at it, isn't a very good scheme. I'll go down under this box a little bit to check this thing. In the early '60s, after a decade of having this dream goal and doing other things in the way, I got a chance to start trying to write a framework paper about, \"Hey how can you really augment?\"</div><br><div>\tAs I started listing all the really neat things you could do in a tool is when it really dawned on me that you have to list these other things that are given to the raw human being as he emerges into a society in order to be capable of operation. The net capability is the basic human, mental, sensory, motor, bundle of potentials in there that have to be trained, conditioned, etc., etc. In order to be really harnessed. Give them all of this and train them and condition etc. inside of that and this system augments that human.<br>\tThat's all we have. Tacking things into here have that same fundamental. [inaudible 00:19:40] Already been in the late '50s just realizing that all of my dreams of this depend upon the assumption that computer technology, digital technology, is going to be very much cheaper, very much faster, very much higher capacity, etc., etc. Like that. The only potential is if it really gets much, much smaller. They were talking about the chips, putting all the stuff on chips, etc.</div><br><div>\tI did, I got a research grant to do a study about the dimensional scaling of electronic components. That means as you cut everything down by a factor of say 10, well different phenomena shift at a different rate. Some of the phenomena depend upon cross-section area. Some upon a linear dimension. Some upon a volume. Each of those characteristics of something is going to change differently with the change in scale. If you have a device that depends upon the interrelationship of this phenomena and this phenomena, as things get smaller, they just might get out of contact. They really will.</div><br><div>\tAn airplane won't fly just by making it 1/10th to scale. Unless you keep a certain combination of parameters constant, etc. One of the things then I read was in biology. A lot of interesting things about the scale in biology. Why north of Spitsbergen there aren't any animals, mammals, smaller than a fox. Turns out that the surface area to volume increases if you get smaller. You make something half the size, it's got one quarter the surface area but one eighth the volume. One eighth of the volume's got to generate, or this metabolism, or heat to lose over a quarter of the ... You've got twice as much space per unit volume. Surface per unit volume to have to support heat. You get down to a certain size, you can't do it. </div><br><div>\tMany other things. One of the reason lessons of that study, well it was interesting to know. I became convinced. Semiconductors are going to run out of gas at a certain size because it just basic phenomena. There are a lot of other phenomena that'll start being able to be effective. The whole push in nanotechnology is just exactly right. There are inevitable things going to start happening like that so that the speed, price, cost, everything is just going to ... We haven't even started yet.</div><br><div>\tOn the right, you look at things on the right side there and say the change in scale of capability on the right of the tools we're going to be able to have and the domains that can operate in. The pervasive impact in this side are going to be on a scale change we've never experienced before in history. When a terribly, terribly, terribly primitive people found they could harness fire or find they could put skins together and make clothing or make shelters, those were very significant, high-scale impacts on their world. The left side will change a lot.</div><br><div>\tSince history started and we became aware of how the left side here can change, we've never had to accommodate something such a big transition then. We're totally unprepared. If we were prepared just because of scaling phenomena we'd start looking up and down all this thing and say, \"What are the candidates for change in almost any category in the human system?\" You find it's ripe for candidates for change. They may do it.</div><br><div>\tOne of the problems though that's been occurring and typified maybe by 1975 when the world started talking about office automation. That's what we're going to do over here. Automate the office. This NLS system sitting over there, my God, what a crappy mix of things that has. So hard to learn, etc. That's way off the beam but it isn't. We're going to be augmenting over here. Which means looking at a particular potential over here, you don't look at it. You should look at it just how it fits today. How does it fit into different conventions and practices, etc.? </div><br><div>\tYou got to look and say, \"How are we going to evolve?\" It's this human augmentation system plus people gives you that capability infrastructure, and that's an extremely thing to do. Anyway it was that perspective that led us then into saying essentially what you're going to talk about is this dynamic knowledge repository, browsing and editing. This today we're really getting these things in co-involved so that when an ordinary we browser, you can start diving down more deeply into the environment we've been used to or stay out in the web world like that.</div><br><div>\tCapture management repository and integrating the group where is full of the slant. Where it start, shared files of course. Not for one minute did I think about that. I looked that at language aspect and that human system and said, there seemed to me a very critical thing. As you work with concepts in your mind, there's structure related etc. Lot of explicits and some associatives. When you externalize this concepts you give them real symbols in your mind and you work with them. Then when you externalize that, that's the real way in which you share with people work. Be it verbally or an environment.</div><br><div>\tWhat can you do that's new for candidate? Well gee. You can try getting it structure so it tries to map better the structure of the concepts in your mind. It's more than just not linear, it's structured. The relationships between, with a lot of concepts can have explicit relationships. You can interlink them by cross-citing. Those are two separate aspects of it. Also you said oh I don't, I can look for a lot for different views once I have it in there. The computer can help me put it in there. Can help me view it. Not only move around it but view it.</div><br><div>\tWe generated quite a few optional views. One of the things we said, oh the view of looking at a page is literally the last thing we want to do. That's before we publish or something like that. When you're working online, we don't want to bother with pages. Nothing like that. That's something where we right away departed from the rest of the world. [inaudible 00:26:12] We laughed at it. We said later on there's no, the last thing you want to do is make it look like a piece of paper. If you're going to go print it but if you're going to really use it online, there are a lot of things about pages and all that that get in the way of what you can do. Browsing, shared screen was an important thing from the very beginning. I want to be able to work with my colleagues. </div><br><div>\tThe very first concept that was the way. We built that thing into it. If I, one of the things I've got to do is ... Already we're running quite late. If I run another 2 hours ... What should I aim for? </div><br><div>Male:\t[inaudible 00:26:57]</div><br><div>Doug:\tAnother half hour. Good. All right I'm going to dive into a quick pictures of some of the things we built back there in those days. Here was the first, the second interactive display that we built to run on a second computer. You say well that's a pretty big box isn't it? Yeah because you couldn't get memories in those days that could you give you bitmap memory. You couldn't make a bitmap screen. What you had to do was draw everything you wanted by deflecting the beam.</div><br><div>\tIf you wanted a big tube you had visibility and light beams that was a very high voltage, high accelerated beam that was hard to move. It took big, heavy amplifiers to move it. With those could have very fast response so you could do it quickly was hard to do. This box here, oops. This box here contains the amplifiers to move the deflection. Oh, what generates the display? Well you see this box over here has all this stuff that generates the deflection for the display so the 2 together are the display system. A separate from the computer. </div><br><div>\tThat was, we had to get that custom made from $80,000 in 1963 or '64 money. Which was a lot of money in those days. You says all right, it was, it took expensive to do that research. One of the things we want to do is try different kind of selection devices. This was one of them, Judy's sitting there holding that. We tried quite a few of them. One of them we tried was this beautiful thing made out of wood. Here's another thing in connection with Vannevar Bush or whatever, it's Vann Bush. Which I didn't appreciate at the time but I'd seen when I was an undergraduate a device that's made up of a couple of arm linkages.</div><br><div>\tYou move a pointer around a closed area of some chart you've made and by looking at the wheels that are on there, etc. You can calculate the area that you've enclosed in this tour. I wonder how that works. The professor said, \"Well a wheel is moving sharp like that will only resolve the direction it's rolling. If it slides sideways it won't resolve that component.\" It just sums up the component of displacement in the direction that rolls.</div><br><div>\tThat's all that this was then, is 2 different orthogonal wheels rolling on a surface. It's related to the way that the differential analyzers, all disc stuff work. Like that. I didn't link it back to the expression to Bush at the time. Anyway that's just one of all the nice things even though we tried a neat thing. To move your knee up or down by pushing on the floor or move it sideways. We picked the best knee to get the photograph of course. </div><br><div>\tI made a head pointer but we the mouse really worked. Another thing is the parallel input. While you're pointing, what are you going to do? We said we'd built this and my kids learned it. We talked to each other. Very simple. The letter A is the first one. B, two of them are C. This one alone's D. It's just totally binary. Turns out kids learn it very quickly. You just draw 1, 2, 4, 8 and a 16 on the fingers and tell them how you count and the pick it up right away. Then say look at the alphabet. That makes a big difference when one's working.<br>\tIn 1967 we actually had a system going where we were having online meetings this way. We went up, when we're going to get a time sharing system, when scaling again you can get much cheaper, higher resolution, speed on a small tube. We'd get a bunch of them at the Tymshare and put industrial camera routes to look at it. This produced the video out in the room. We shared drawing the pictures on these little screens like that. That was an innovation that led us get our laboratory equipment out there. </div><br><div>\tMerely having 2 big frames like this are character, display generators, 12 workstations out in the lab and it took a lot of maintenance. You have to realize that. Out in the laboratory a simple monitor and the keyset and a mouse and a keyboard, these were standard ways. Standard because of the way things operated was well we experimented with different innovations. This is the typical way. Stand, sit there with mouse, keyset and shift to the keyboard. You get long literals. The speed of operation I don't think has been equaled since.<br>\tI may be one of the first people in the world that had a private workstation in the office just to do my daily work all the time. That other people worked out in this bull pen out here with all of them. It was a really interesting social thing which was an important way in which everybody learned together about how to learn it. We wanted to give a show in that 1968 thing. We borrowed some of the cameras and got a tripod up there. Borrowed people to come help make camera working.</div><br><div>\tUp in the Brooks Hall in San Francisco, we had a big video projector that put something on that screen. You could see a little bit of it now that you could read from the back of the [inaudible 00:32:18] We had to shift, we had to lease ... Go out and put temporary video links from SRI to the 35 or 40 miles up the city to run this thing. Up in the front I was sitting at a console there and there was a camera above looking down. Another one mounted on the console looking at me. In the back of the room was our director building, we put all this together.<br>\tWhile it was running I could be demonstrating things and talking. We'll run a little bit of this footage. It's, you have to realize it's the system we had been using and working with. It could be used both as a presentation thing and as a work example. The world's first picture of a mouse, this was moving there on one half of the frame. You could see the cursor moving on the other. The way in which the controls would work was also pictured like that. One of the things that was important, well Jeff [Rulerson 00:33:13] had been with us a couple years by then. He's responsible for a lot of the architecture underneath.</div><br><div>\tHe showed up today, sitting over here. He now works at Sun. He came online and unfortunately, when I took 20 minutes of clips from that hour and a half and put them together, his I think when Bill [Paxton 00:33:31] came to share screen on it instead of when Jeff did. You could've seen that. Let's run a little bit of that video please. </div><br><div>\tThis is 1968. If I'd known Bush was still alive and active, we made [crosstalk 00:33:53]</div><br><div>\tI hope you'll go along with this rather unusual setting and the fact that I remain seated when I get introduced. The fact that I'm going to come to you mostly through this medium here for the rest of the show. I should tell you that I'm backed up by quite a staff of people between here and [inaudible 00:34:09] Park where Stanford Research is located. Some 30 miles south of here. If everyone just does our job well, it'll all go very interesting. I think. The research program that I'm going to describe to you is quickly characterizable by saying if in your office you was an intellectual worker or supplied with a computer display. Backed up by a computer that was alive for you all day and was instantly responsible, responsive. Instantly responsive to every action you had, how much value could you derive from that?<br>\tThis basically characterizes what we've been pursuing for many years in what we call the augmented human intellect research center at Stanford Research Institute. </div><br><div>\tLook what else we can do in here. I've got this file that's structured. If I want to see what's in there I can walk down. The hierarchy levels and see or return. There's another thing I can do. There's a room type set I have here. Here I'm afraid I'll need to picture the view. Here's what I do with a picture drawing capability here. Slight map if I start from work and here's the route I seem to have to go to pick up all the materials. That's my plan for getting home tonight.</div><br><div>\tIf I want to, I can say the library. What am I supposed to pick up there? I can just point to that and oh I see. Overdue books and all. There was a statement there with that name on it. Go back. What am I supposed to pick up at the drugstore? I see, interesting. Market. We've already seen that. Additional like that. Gee that's too much. Anyway we have this feature of structuring our material, hierarchically and being able to move around it very well. When we get a hierarchy, such as I can show you here now.</div><br><div>\tI can do things if I want to. Just say I'd like to interchange produce and canned materials. Bingo! They're all numbered right. If I care to look, interchanging them very quickly. Cans are going to get interchanged with produce. They do it and all gets renumbered. I have ways of studying over, making different views, moving around, going to specify points and modifying the structure at the same time I've seen that I have a repertoire of different entities.</div><br><div>\tLike character, knock off that character. Replace the character. Make that P. I have entities of all sorts that I can say I want to go operations on. This basic structure that I can move over and study and get about very quickly. That is the essence now. That's the essence of the tool we have. That's a lot of details that I've left out for you. Now I'd like to stop a minute and just make sure you understand we're shifting from a luster material to the real working stuff. In case you wouldn't recognize it otherwise.</div><br><div>\tWe had, we use this tool to do our daily work and it's our system has been built as time sharing for about 6 months now it's been working. In that time, we've gone from getting one console to getting about 6 working now with 6 more due the rest this spring. This is out 4th computer in which we've had this systems. We've learned a lot about user features we want and how to be fairly skillful. This next step about learning when you're faced with having this in your office all day as I now do. In a very exciting sense. How do you put that to work for yourself? How do you organize your files? What kind of things do you do?</div><br><div>\tTo get going on this, let's switch away from the tool we have here and talk about some of the general features of the program. Some of the ways that's built to get back a little later to the nature of the, our usage of it. That program involves about 17 people together with a special laboratory facilities we have. It's sponsored by government agencies exclusively ARPA, NASA and RADC now. In the past, AFOSR and ESD. These were the people that first [inaudible 00:38:52] many years ago.</div><br><div>\tAll right. It's a goal oriented pursuit for many years. I think we can just go off and get a quick little picture I sketched to show this is the staffing over the years from 1950 on. It's had slightly bumpy history. During these years there was only 1 of us. I go back to where I was and say let's continue on in this file. That link took me up to a different file, a statement for that view. I jump back to this file where I was and now within this file I make a link to another. To say the HIRC is pursuing these goals. Basic goal. Improve the effectiveness with which individuals and organizations work at intellectual tasks. What is their effect in this involve them?</div><br><div>\tBetter solutions. Faster solutions. Solutions to more complex problems. Better use of human capabilities. Really thinking about that. A corollary goal is besides improving the effectiveness, what the system oriented discipline for designing the means by which greater effectiveness is achieved. It's very important to us, the approach for this should be result in this system oriented discipline.<br>\tLet me just show you how I constructed this file. You notice what's underneath there with that and that. There were just a link hidden here that went back to this view with a slightly different view parameters. To give you that view. All right there's another one hidden there. It says the general approach for us empirical. We're pursuing this monstrous goal, monstrously difficult to. By building and trying empirically, and we're approaching it evolutionary-wise because we feel that it's a whole system problem. You need to get a person in that environment working and looking at the many aspects of his working system that are involved in his effectiveness.</div><br><div>\tThat's many more things than just these computerized tools. In a large system like that, we need to do it evolutionary-wise because we can't be analytic enough about it at any one point to decide what best our next thing should be. We can only decide from here as well as we can analyze it. Where we can invest our next resources to get the most return at an increase to the effectiveness of the system we have. This item down here is the term bootstrapping implied in a slightly new sense.</div><br><div>\tWe're applying that to our approach. Where we're saying we need to, a research subject group to give them these tools. Put them to work with them. Study them and improve them. Aha! We'll do that by making ourselves be the subject group and studying ourselves. Making the tools so that they improve our ability to develop and study these systems and to produce in the end this system discipline.</div><br><div>\tIt's going to, it's a struggle doing it that way but it's beginning to pay off.</div><br><div>\tI was tempting to run. These are clips taken from an hour and a half. There were a couple things in there I really want to get to but the time's running too short to. We've brought, during that hour and a half, 3 different people were tuned in that faces appeared in here. We were seeing their work or we were sharing the screens together, etc. One of them, I was hoping to get there and show you but these videos are available to people. Might be interested in them.</div><br><div>\tWhat I wanted to do is come back to this screen here and to the right. We saw the mix in here. In those intervening years after that, we did a lot of things that were much beyond what we've been talking about here. We got here and we were talking about this is the kind of thing we displayed at the time here. A shared files our software was all being done that way. When Jeff [inaudible 00:43:18] was one whose face was brought up. He was showing the structure and all of the software, etc. like that. </div><br><div>\tThe next thing we did was integrate email. The next 2 years later we started operating on a network with a second mode. We were to provide the network information center. We were providing integrated emailing which these were the hyperobjects that could interlink between email and to the shared file. At the same time, another thing which was a very significant part of our work which I don't see it used yet out there. Just made an immense difference in how the dynamics of the dialogue go on in there.</div><br><div>\tThat when you submit a document to this software and administrative operations system called The Journal, it would get cataloged. You would do it in a very similar to [inaudible 00:44:14] email. With more new fields that could go into a catalog and instead of sending the content in a message, you could just put a link to some other file and that would get cataloged. Then the system guaranteed that any end time ever more to access that file, link to any other way, you were guaranteed you'd get what the author published on that time.</div><br><div>\tThe publication was not just a year like they are now, but a day and a minute down there. A few minutes later, somebody could've put a response in that cited yours, etc. The dynamics of all of that for managing dialog flow was just beautiful. When you watch email and a lot of conference things out there and you realize you can't do that in there. Anyway it's very significant difference to that. </div><br><div>\tI terminate. I can literally spend hours in all of this and if I want to be any friend of [inaudible 00:45:15] in the future I'd better get to you. Gee what's it worth Andy? </div><br><div>Male:\t[inaudible 00:45:25]</div><br><div>Doug:\tThe one thing that really helped me a lot and portrayed to people what I sent about all this is to take those 2 major dimensions of an augmentation system. Make it like a frontier. You have to realize that each of these dimensions in turn is a multi-dimensional vector. To array that along a vector line such that you can say that's increasing system improvement would be hard put done. Just picture it that way. We can picture today out here some frontier boundary. We're pretty sure in 20 years there'll be technologies available to harness that way beyond that.</div><br><div>\tSimilarly people are beginning to realize about that process reegineering that's potentially available. The new skills, the new roles, etc. that can go on the organizations. Those all make something in this vector. Our organizations are all clustered down here now. The product people are maybe the most of them are out here some place close to the edge of what organizations can use. They're not going to make things that organizations can't use yet.</div><br><div>\tWhat is an organization? If somebody brought a technology that was way out here that could really provide really new changes, would there be any market for it? There wouldn't picture any. There's no market pull from the larger user organizations that clusters of communities that could benefit by this group collective capability. They don't know, they don't have the experience to know what they want to yet. This is an unexplored frontier. Exploration has got to be more than just people writing papers or a few graduate students trying something.<br>\tTo explore you really have to put up a group of people that's going to live that way to do heavy knowledge work that's representative of what it's going to be like when they're part of a larger collective organization. It's like saying we need outposts out there. Well you can put one out there now that used the forefront of what the technology and the product line could cause. Somebody could bring out some brand new technology and say you can harness that in the most advanced process engineering organization.</div><br><div>\tWhere's this as a frontier? Where's this? Where's the responsibility lie in our society for exploring that frontier? Enough so any kind of interested organization says, \"God we got to get out there because if we don't, the ones who do are going to win.\" That's true for a country too. Who's going to do the exploring? It's very different from a group of people that can make an exploratory technology and demonstrate it. This is where you're going to have people who've adopted their learning and working bases in there that's in a way that's like this is oh that's representative enough of how my own organization's work or some significant part of it. I'll move one department or one division or something out there now.</div><br><div>\tI have to realize that the cost of moving vertically in this space is much higher than moving horizontally. That if the horizontal thing keeps plugging out there and forces organizations to zig-zag out here, that's extremely expensive. You say, \"Ah, industry and the product people would never do that, would they?\" Well hah! The personal computer field was about 10 years old before they started doing anything significant with the networks. Yet when they began 11, 12 years ago, it was clear they've been 11, 12, 13 years of experience with the ARPANET where it's very clear that anybody who's going to really work significantly at an interactive terminal wants to be connected. Yet there were no provision for it. In fact it was rejected very adamantly. </div><br><div>\tLike the guy that went around and says, \"Oh geez, none of the girls in this county want to get married.\" How do you know? \"I asked them.\" I asked these guys, \"How about connecting?\" I get very flat pictures that that's not what you want to do. Well anyway that's 10 years of lost opportunity for our society to start learning how to harness all this. Thinking about, etc. We've got to do better, and who?</div><br><div>\tThere's several possibilities. Cooperative, collective, end user organizations of communities that get together to start investing in it. A government role could be in there too. A government role could be there to say, \"Let's,\" if we get communities of users that say, enough of us are significant going to want to set up an outpost that they can start underwriting. Some of the technology here that could do that for that group if they get the feedback so they coevolve together. There are endless places in the military and the rest of government where you can apply much improved, collective capability. </div><br><div>\tThat's the end of my presentation for all this. I really kept wishing now more than ever that we had cans, 3 half hour cans of 16 millimeter film in what resulted from that presentation in '68. I really wish I would've known that Bush was still alive and active. I would've sent that to him because it could've made a lot of difference at least for me to get connected with him like that. Great to have respect for what he did, etc. I wish I hadn't had to go off somehow on a lone vector in this.</div><br><div>\tNow that's it. Andy, are we still friends?</div><br><div>Male:\t[inaudible 00:51:15]</div><br><div>Speaker:\tMr. Modesty as always. What I like to do is since Doug quit exactly on time is give him the 10 minutes he earned for Q&A and some interaction with the audience. Do us a favor and please go to the microphone. Identify yourself and speak up so that you can be recorded for the record.</div><br><div>Doug:\tOf course you can always just pass on it and we can quit. </div><br><div>Speaker:\tAnyone to the microphone? Bob Cohn.</div><br><div>Bob:\tI was thinking, [inaudible 00:52:21] those reels of tape to Vannevar Bush, what kind of reaction do you think you might've gotten back?</div><br><div>Doug:\tWell, that's a very good question, Bob. I'm sorry you asked it. What my experience had been from the '50s, for many, still often, is people that I wouldn't have thought would get excited about it would get turned off. Would feel like that I was invading some domain as an alien stranger who didn't understand that domain and was talking about bringing toys to bear that didn't seem relevant. One things experience that stands out very much in my mind in the very early '60s, '60, '61, I had a chance to visit. Was invited to come and talk to the group at the Institute for Behavioral Science or something like this. </div><br><div>\tThe people who came on a year's sabbatical to Stanford and sat around and thought and talked about behavioral science. I went over and talked about this time. Afterwards sitting out in the patio at a picnic table with 4 of them, I started to get really beaten up and turns out, one of the guys had been specializing in information retrieval for decades or something like that. He felt honestly felt violated. That here's somebody talking about some bringing some toys in that didn't understand what information retrieval's about. That the professionals have it under control and that I should just get out.</div><br><div>\tI don't have the same years of experience with that. People in psychology, people in social science, people la, I would get that very often through the years. If Bush had gotten back in touch, I wouldn't have been terribly surprised if he responded that way. I kept trying. I would have just as delighted if for his experience etc. out there, his contacts, if he could've participated with me somehow. Saying, \"Okay, where next?\" Did I answer? [inaudible 00:54:42] </div><br><div>Male:\tDoug if your work had not been interrupted in the mid-'70s at SRI and funding had continued at a high level, what are some of the other things that you think you would've worked on?</div><br><div>Doug:\tWell we had a program actively started of enlisting organizations that could access us to the ARPANET to start learning and trying. We would've been just going after that bootstrapping where you come into an organization and can't expect them all to go [inaudible 00:55:20] You can't expect just to wheel in a bunch of truckload of technology and expect them to change. We'd started out by saying, \"You have to appoint somebody hopefully not a programmer that are going to call the architect of your knowledge workshop.\"</div><br><div>\tThat has to be a person that the user group that they're interested in respects this person as understanding their work and their job, etc. That person's going to be the architect working together. We support that person. Learn a lot from that person [inaudible 00:55:53] We have a prototype community like that going that all just got clobbered, etc. There are many, many technical things that we just were waiting to do.</div><br><div>\tWe very much would like to have added speech so you could have the product speech inside of there. Of course the graphics would've been better. To learn how to interface with CAD systems and database systems and the like. A lot of evolution. I think it's fair to go after. The things we've been doing now, realizing that the World Wide Web just gave the world an extremely exciting stimulus. It just was it's a priceless thing.</div><br><div>\tIt would be very nice if somehow that momentum can carry on to say look not just for publishing, but let's move that capability into what we do every day. Minute by minute. Every memo I write is linkable too. Let's make it so every object in it is addressable intrinsically. That I don't have to go put a tag on it on purpose so if somebody can cite. A list of about 15 things like that I wrote down last spring that ... Anyway. </div><br><div>\tI'd be giving you the whole lecture wouldn't I?</div><br><div>Male:\tJust to follow up on this speculation of what might've happened if you've gotten a little bit better communication channel with Dr. Bush, when we found your letter in the MIT archives it was from 1962. From what we could tell, his health had been up and down at that point. He clearly wasn't around when the letter arrived. It was a secretary who responded. Now just also to give a little perspective, there was a large technology effort here at MIT in 1965 I believe called the Intrex Project at the library. Where they were trying to create the library of the future back in the past.</div><br><div>\tThey were doing this with combination of microfilm readers and electronic computers. They made a tremendous effort to get him to both come and speak at a large conference and interact with the people. Thinking that he would be interested because they felt that what they were doing was clearly related to his work. At that point he'd really distanced himself from this. He was willing to come and give a 10-minute speech but he didn't seem to be all that interested in interacting with people who were following it.</div><br><div>\tI think part of it is this paradigm issue that you were on the other side of. He was very much an analog machine person. He felt rather uneasy with people who were dealing with digital machines because he wasn't the expert in digital machines. He was the expert in analog machines. I think you were, in a way, suffering from that problem. You were a future expert on a technology that most of the experts at the time didn't really understand.</div><br><div>Doug:\tI just learned a lot. That what I really think is that the biggest limiting factor in where there are society or how fast our society can really integrate the potential of all of this, rests upon the paradigm shift factor. I call it the paradigm shiftlessness. That it's a very natural thing and I felt very injured by it for a while. Then I, this introspection you're supposed to do, I realized I do it too. That people can be trying to tell me something for quite a while. Somehow later when I found out that's what they were trying to tell me then it's easier to be angry at them because they didn't really explain it right.</div><br><div>Male:\tI'd like the privilege of the last question. Doug, what do you think the hardest several research problems are that remain to be solved at this point? What do you think we need to put our focus on?</div><br><div>Doug:\tWell I think it's the research environment is the biggest thing. Getting it where you've really got groups of people that are committed to really change. In my sense, to get them almost after recruit. Advertise recruit and put through basic training and equipped and trained like you would if you said I'm going to take a bunch of flatland people and train them to be ski group. That's something you got. Equipment training before you can start learning what it's going to be next.</div><br><div>\tThat's what I feel. High performance teams are something we should really go after.</div><br><div>Speaker:\twith that again, it was terrific. It was a privilege having you here. </div><br><div>\tPlenty of opportunity to say hello to Doug and [inaudible 01:00:45] during coffee which starts now. We'll reconvene here in 25 minutes. </div><br><div>\tCoffee is upstairs. Bathrooms are around the corner. 25 minutes, we start again.<br></div>",

        "full": "<div>Speaker 1:\tA visitor here, at Procter & Gamble this afternoon, Doug Engelbart, who is sitting next to me here, is a man of extreme eminence in the world of information technology, as you all know. He worked on things 30-40 years ago, that today would be considered visionary, and we are very, very fortunate, to have Doug join us. He's been working with people in the company today. Tonight, we fly to IBM. He'll be working with our team at IBM tomorrow. Then talking with some of their upstream computer scientists in IBM at their research labs tomorrow afternoon. His daughter Christina is here with Doug. Could you stand up Christina? Even before we begin, I'd like to give a warm welcome to Doug and Christina.</div><br><div>\tI think you all know that among Doug's major inventions, going way back in the 1960s, was the invention of the mouse, the multi-window user interface, the hypertext language, things that today we could not have in the information age without the sense of vision and the sense of how to use technology to augment the human mind, which was Doug's original concept. It has been a driving force vision in his mind over the last 40 or more years.</div><br><div>\tDoug and I were fortunate enough to meet at dinner about 3 weeks ago in Silicon Valley, a dinner that Bob Johansen organized through the Institute for the Future. Based on that dinner, where Christina was also present, I decided to invite Doug to Procter & Gamble to take a look at what we were doing, and also let him share with us particularly all of you his thoughts and ideas of what's been happening in the world of information technology, in the past as well as into the future. He is truly a man of tremendous future vision.</div><br><div>\tTo give you an example of that, before we get started this afternoon, I would like, if you could [Bob Coons 00:02:01], to set up a video of Doug Engelbart in 1968, I believe, experimenting and demonstrating his very first mouse. Right after this, we'll get started with giving Doug a chance to talk to us. I'll be asking some questions. We will encourage all of your participation. Doug, here you are, back 30 years ago. You probably, I don't know when the last time you saw this so let's take a look.</div><br><div>Speaker 2:\tThis was at a computer conference in San Francisco, in front of an audience of over a thousand people.</div><br><div>Speaker 3:\tTo talk about control devices, we'll use this overhead camera shot, where you can see the devices that I'm using. I use 3 and they're not all standard. We have a pointing device called a mouse, a standard keyboard and a special key set we have here. We're going to go for a picture down in our laboratory in Menlo Park and pipe it up, that'll show you, from another point of view, more about how that mouse works. Come in Menlo Park.</div><br><div>\tThere's Don Ander's hand in Menlo Park and in a second we'll see the screen that he's working and the way the tracking spot moves in conjunction with movements of that mouse. I don't know why we call it a mouse. Sometimes, I apologize. It started that way and we never did change it.</div><br><div>\tAs it moves up or down or sideways so does the tracking spot. The principal for its operation is quite easy to see. You'll turn it over Don. Can you hear me, Don? Would you turn it over and we'll see? Its principle is that there are 2 wheels that roll on the surface. Since they're right angles and kind of sharp edges, one roll and the other slide in one direction. Each of these wheels controls the potentiometer with a voltage output, sampled by an A to D converter. The numbers taken in by the computer at sample times as to what the horizontal and vertical components are to be of where it should put the tracking spot.</div><br><div>\tAs the mouse moves over a surface, each of those wheels either slides sideways without rolling or rolls an amount that very closely duplicates the particular component of horizontal or vertical in the net motion it makes.</div><br><div>\tIf you take a mouse and move it through some closed trajectory, back to the same point, usually the tracking spot won't come back to exactly the same place it was on the screen. For that sense, it wouldn't work well if you're trying to trace maps or other figures and diagrams. The way that we use it continuously and exclusively, is to watch the screen and to follow it around. We use this device to move that tracking spot and you're eyeing the tracking spot. You really don't care whether it follows exactly this or not. In fact, we had it at times, where our tracking device, you had to move in an arc, like that, to make the tracking spot go on a horizontal line. People adjusted to it and would go like that to go in a straight line and wouldn't even know that they were doing it.</div><br><div>\tOther features of the mouse are that, it stays put. I can lift it and replace it without having a spot change, so I can adjust where I want it for my comfort. These control buttons on the top are used quite a bit. I'll show you a little bit later, how some of those are used. The keyboard in the middle is essentially a standard ...</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tThat's it, 30 years ago, this was the man who was inventing the mouse that we use today. It's still a mouse, no one has changed the name. I think Logitech, the company that now houses Doug's Bootstrap Foundation sells 40 million or some-odd of these things.</div><br><div>\tAnyway, Doug to get this started I might like to ask a question and ask you to recall, what was going in your life, and at the time you originally had this vision of using computers, which back then, did not really even exist, with the notion of using them to augment the human mind and to deal with the increasing complexities that you saw happening in the world?</div><br><div>Doug:\tThe triggering action was getting engaged. The next Monday, driving to work ... One thing I have to background, is I grew up in the Depression, which leaves a lasting impact. Lots of times you grow up in a depression and getting a steady job was a big thing, because a lot of your neighbors didn't have steady jobs or something like that. I had a steady job. I was working as an electrical engineer, for what's now NASA.</div><br><div>\tAnother thing is, you're going to get married and live happily ever after. I was engaged and that part of it was okay. Driving to work I suddenly got to thinking of, \"What are my goals, career-wise, professionally?\" It was the funniest experience to just suddenly realize other than having an interesting job and a steady one, I didn't have any, which shows to some extent kind of what a backwards country kid I was.</div><br><div>\tI thought, \"Why don't I start setting up what could goals be?\" For some reason, I realized earning a lot of money would be nice, but, \"Gee, you could probably do quite a few things that would be contributory or interesting and also earn enough money.\" I set that aside. It wasn't very long before I tried on in my head, \"What if you try to maximize a contribution your career would make in society?\" I have no idea where that comes from. Sometimes, I almost curse it, because that locked me in, for some reason, to really thinking about that.</div><br><div>\tThen started thinking about, \"I'm an engineer, and who needs more engineering? So, what are the things the world really needs? Gee, it needs a more stable economy. It needs more education. It needs a bunch of things like that. Oh, and I should go try to make a crusade to do something singular in those fields. Any of that, I'd probably have to go get refurbished as an economist or an educator, or something. I was 25, and do I want to go back and line up with the 18 year olds?\"</div><br><div>\tI kept thinking about crusades of all kinds. After 2 \u00bd months of that, I think it was, one Saturday morning, it suddenly dawned on me that crusades are very hard to design because the world is complex enough so you can't really be sure that you designed a solution that when it gets implemented isn't going to have side effects that are as bad as you were trying to cure.</div><br><div>\tOne example being, \"I guess I'll go in and try and clear up the swamps in this country, because of so much yellow fever. It's really hard on all the natives.\" You do that. In another generation, their population's grown so much that that's what's ruining that environment. [inaudible 00:09:23] One Saturday morning, it just dawned on me. It's very complex and getting more so.</div><br><div>\tMost of the complex challenges to society have to be dealt with collectively and our collective ability to deal with complex. Urgent issues and problems, isn't increasing nearly as fast as the complexity and urgency are. This was 1951. I was an electrical engineer and I've been interestingly enough I've been a radar technician in the Navy during World War 2 and so I knew how radar screens could draw pictures and how simple digital stuff in there could handle things.</div><br><div>\tI read about computers so I knew that anything if a computer can punch cards or print paper they can draw anything you want on a screen. I also knew because that radar that you can sample what the operator is doing so they can keep track of what you're doing and you can interact with the computer. Now that will let you use all kinds of new symbology on the cathode ray tube screen and colleagues of yours could sit around tied to the same complex and you'd collaborate. It'd be a totally new different way to try to connect to your brain.</div><br><div>\tIt's embarrassing to say that that's the kind of thing I just tied my life to. My young fianc\u00e9e was looking forward to settling down. She'd grew up as an army brat and she and her old relatives were so pleased that she was going to get to settle down with a guy that had a steady job. \u201cOh dear I've gotten accepted to graduate school at Berkeley because I'm building a computer there.\u201d Being off on that now it's been every year since then pursuing that. There are a lot of stages I can tell you about its evolution including the last is when Christina, one of my daughter has teamed up with me to form an institute that's really trying to sell the world on a real strategic approach to try to do this.</div><br><div>\tIf I kept talking long enough he couldn't ask me any more questions.</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tWe might come back to bootstrap a little bit later. What has impressed you about the evolution of information technology over the years? For example the evolution of personal computers or the development of the Microsoft corporation or the explosion of today's internet. What are the most impressive things to you as you look back over the last 3 decades?</div><br><div>Doug:\tThis may surprise you but it's how slow it's moving and how hard it is to get people to look ahead far enough. To me that's ... in times of such explosive change as this the paradigms that are really guiding and settling the world's way of looking at things have to shift in concordance with that. They have to get farther ahead and that just hasn't been happening. That was a surprise to me but it's also very valuable lesson.</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tIn terms of things that might be frustrating to you having been a bit ahead of most of the rest of us it would be in the area of speed with which things have occurred or the lack of a continuing forward going vision like what's the next big evolution of technology</div><br><div>Doug:\tThe frustration was basically that there wasn't any place for me to connect. We had really a flowering laboratory in the \u201860s and \u201870s and most of things I get allotted for were generated during that period was supported by ARPA and somewhat other government agencies but we were just really trying to build a news and evolve could really make a difference. Then we're at a cross people's perception began to be so much different about automate your offices etc. on the one hand so you're just automating. The other hand it was the artificial intelligence people saying we're going to make such smart computers that they'll sit there and they'll make a model of the user and they'll find out what the user can do and knows and needs and then they'll match to that and the user won't have to learn anything.</div><br><div>\tBetween the 2 of them I just got sent ... we lost all the support and had to go into commercial world. That was a very good eye opener. We had a system that was sturdy enough to be selling services. A history that goes back to the time when [BARPA 00:14:12] the government agency decided it was going to experiment with computer networking. They told the 13 of us principal investigators supported by ARPA and the interactive computing field. Each of us had a time sharing computer that was experimenting. They told us that in order to experiment with a network they were going to tie us together. This horrified everybody else. It just thrilled me because I needed a community to interact and do this stuff.</div><br><div>\tI volunteered to start and run a network information center for that. For that purpose they made me the second computer tied to the network. All your internets I've been on it since day 1, since the packets got sent back and forth. Seven or eight years later we got shut down because we were judged to be going in the wrong direction. Ever since then it's been trying almost from the outside not being a part of real organizations and enough to steer things trying to sell and tell and just so many fruitless almost sales to every one of the big companies you know [Deq 00:15:23], Hewlett Packard and IBM we've knocked on doors. We almost had a real pilot going at McDonnell Douglas.</div><br><div>\tAnyway, we had things that could a lot of the stuff you're showing without nearly the color and the glamor but the hypermedia system was much more detailed. You could make a link that sited any object in the document and you could actually use that link in an instruction if you wanted to, as an address to go copy that word to here or something. You had all kinds of viewing options when you looked at a document that helped a great deal doing stuff. You had explicit hierarchical structure you could apply to it that would help you move around, get views etc.</div><br><div>\tWe had a way to put in documents that were unchangeable just like your publishing and linkage and reference from any place. We had multiple computers being able to [interconnect 00:16:22] between each other and it was a client server thing. Anyway just on and on because it was evolving with everybody used it. We used it for our software and that system where it's still runnable now at least it can show 500,000 lines of code and every one of those is in a hyper structure that you can link to and talk about. Just on and on very different and yet showing it, describing it, saying what the future could be you just couldn't find anybody that could hear it.</div><br><div>\tIf [DEQ 00:16:55] and Hewlett Packard and IBM weren't doing it, we cannot. Anyway it's very exciting now to see it begin exploding. What I had to do during those years was think about the strategy of if it's really extremely complex set of changes going to happen in a rate that we've never had to cope with before then you need a strategy for how any big organization should start doing its evolution. We can talk about more of that later. Gee I could ... on second thought I'll keep talking because then you'll ...</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tNo that's why we wanted to have you come and talk with us. If we were 30 years from today into the future, what do you think we would see that would be surprising and different to us than what we see today?</div><br><div>Doug:\tLet's start out with what I believe the technology would evolve towards. There's a brand of it that I buy completely and it's called nanotechnology. Its saying, \u201cWe can make devices by reorienting explicit single molecules together into little packages of multi molecular things that are going to functionally do interesting things. Out of that we can make all kinds of stuff especially digital.\u201d It's just inevitable honestly. I asked the leaders of that year ago I said, \u201cWhat can you tell people about that made it?\u201d He says, \u201cHere's one thing. You'd be able to hold in your hand a hunk of something that's got as much digital storage, memory, computing power etc. as all the computers in the world had today.\u201d</div><br><div>\tThat's a scale change that it's just unthinkable and you can easily set it aside but it's just as inevitable as in 1960 or something I was telling people every knowledge worker is going to be able to work at a cathode ray tube dynamically what a computer. It's inevitable. That's the kind of thing that got me pushed to Siberia. Supposed it's 10% or 20% probable instead of inevitable like that, how far should you do prepare for it? I think in 30 years if not holding your hand everything that's all the power that's in the world today, it's all the power that's in Cincinnati today for sure in this state whichever state we're in now.</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tOhio.</div><br><div>Doug:\tYeah Ohio. Christina and I neither have been here before. We grew up on the west coast so much that everything the other side of Nevada or something or back east that's my use. We'll see. Ohio, isn't that near Iowa? No, that's the other state. Anyway somehow thinking about the kind of shifts like that and what it means is going to be very, very important. In the past it's always been aimed at what the individual user is going to see or do. What really was me from the word go is the collective capability of people, how that improves and changes. In the last years Christina and I have been talking about the collective IQ of any organization. That's a very, very real thing.</div><br><div>\tYou got a collective group of people P&G well there's a change in the outside world that's going to affect what it best should do. Maybe it's a threat or an opportunity. You look at that as an organism and say, \u201cHow soon does it marshal the really appropriate understanding of the outside world make a plan for the adaptation it's going to do. Take stock of its resources. Reorganize and make a plan for them and coordinate the resources so it's really marching in a new directing effectively.</div><br><div>\tHow well and rapidly would it do that? That's a sign of its collective IQ. Anyway, you think of a country so you're start to engage it or something like that and you don't come up with very high numbers for the collective IQ you can reserve in terms of what would be there if you realized think about how you can harness all of the latent mental capability of all the people in it. Its tremendous talent but it's connected very, very ineffectively. Anyway, that's ...</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tOkay do you have kinds of pictures?</div><br><div>Doug:\tGo ahead.</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tIf we think about the point you just made communities of people working together creating a new knowledge, sharing that knowledge, developing insights that lead to actions in the marketplace, how would you see companies that want to be at the leading edge of this whole area identifying and using their collective IQ, what should they be doing today to do that? We are working hard to try to become more of a learning organization, knowledge creating and sharing. You've seen some demonstrations of some of the tools we're using.</div><br><div>\tI'm interested in your thoughts and ideas because its right on your whole notion of collective IQ it also feeds to your idea of A, B and C which I might ask that you share with our group here today of how you take what you're doing and prove it and then improve the way you improve it. Share with us your thoughts and ideas about what the really smart organizations ought to be doing today to get a better job in this whole area using communities of interest within the organization to create new knowledge and use it better?</div><br><div>Doug:\tThe basic thing is that there isn't anybody that knows the answers about what you really best could end up becoming or something. It's just more complex and certainly managing your knowledge is certainly important and collaboration is certainly important. What the configuration is going to be of how you change all the ways you work etc. there's nobody that knows. Much less knows what the environment of proctor and gamble is going to be in 10 years. You have to be able to adapt both to the challenge of changing you internal mode so you get more effective as well as the challenge of adapting to a rapidly changing world.</div><br><div>\tTo me the most important thing comes this issue of how do you set up an infrastructure to guide your improvement and evolution so that that can be as reasonably as effective as possible. You can always give an answer that pushes it off to ask another question because you didn't ... next question please.</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tI'd be very interested when you say build an infrastructure to do this better. What comes to mind when you about infrastructure in that regard?</div><br><div>Doug:\tShall we do this?</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tSure.</div><br><div>Doug:\tAnyway this collective IQ we have this presentation that Christina and I have made in the past. It's based upon a macromedia director show and it oriented around this kind of set of boxes each of which is really a miniature modification to a paradigm. It turned out in the studies ... There was 2 \u00bd year study I did between 1959 and 1962 that publication in our web that's got a German history technology group send us an email a few months ago and says, \u201cWe found that report and we put it on the web for you.\u201d It'd be very interesting so that that whole picture there was a very important one.</div><br><div>\tMuch of what come across in these changes here sort of come out in raw form in that one and then more advances to it. What I could do is just very quickly show it to you by not just highlighting it like that but by highlighting with a center piece of information that tells a little bit about it. You start out with the objective of high performance organization and after a while studying that you begin to realize you don't just go change a couple of core competencies. That if you're going to have really radical change support systems like the technology, there is a whole infrastructure capabilities that makes an organization tick.</div><br><div>\tYou need to really consider all of that because there candidates all throughout that infrastructure candidates that the technology is going to be able to impact and such. Then you say another thing that was a real breakthrough for our techie guy who I had been thinking for 10 years and about the tools was this thing about saying, \u201cYou're going to augment people and you're thinking of all the tools but for the radical things coming on, there's a whole set of skills and knowledge and roles and even your language and the way you portray things and everything else that they're going to impact.</div><br><div>\tThen the realization that what makes your organization capable in the first place is a system that augments you.\u201d It starts out with developing a language and such as that when you're in the cultures that you acculturated with in the schools etc. your family and then the particular professional skills you do. Then the facilities that are put together that are made all this but all the conventions about how you organize groups, how you lead them, what kind of roles you have in there, how you establish a committee and stuff, there's a huge amount of invention in that.</div><br><div>\tIt's the combined of those 2 that augments all of us so our latent natural capabilities are able to connect together and do what we can do. Then saying it's a revolution coming in this tool system so that's going to take that in order to accommodate that it's going to be a comparable, collateral revolution in the human system side. That just wasn't people language. You have to work together and this led to us saying \u201cOur approach has got to be a pragmatic coevolution. I'm extremely pleased.\u201d When the discussion is going on in this group today so far that I've heard it its right out there. You got human resources, you got all kinds of other stuff talking about how we collaterally coevolve these things but that's a big important thing.</div><br><div>\tOne other thing is to realize what's the scale of change that we need to accommodate. I've always been operating all this on this huge scale everything in the world that the scale of change and the rapidity of it and the technology in the digital world is just exceeding anything that any society in our world has ever had to cope with before in a global ... it's going to be an integrated global affected change and very complex and very fast. The cost to any organization about concurrently evolving with that is going to be much higher and the rate of change and stuff like that. Then you say \u201cWhat I need in that I need to consider the return on investment for my investment in change and improvement.\u201d I'd like to find strategy that instead of bump, bump, bump, bump everything like that well give me a compounded return. Isn't that very businesslike of me?</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tVery.</div><br><div>Doug:\tI knew about compound interest because of banking and the kids. I don't know much about business really. Anyway this was ... you want to look for some kind of business like investment criteria for how you would really best in a strategic sense invest in your improvement or evolution. This comes out for centering on an improvement infrastructure because that base back here with your capability infrastructure. Well some subpart of that is infrastructure that is employed to do your improvement.</div><br><div>\tIn a 62 paper or something like that. I was really looking for how do you get that amplification. It suddenly start occurring to me that if in this change process I get it so that I can use some of the new capabilities that I'm bringing up into this capability infrastructure. If I can use it for this I get bootstrapping out of it. That I'm not only one major being more effective organization is boosting your product cycle. Well if not only that if I can bring in new capabilities and if I had an appropriate improvement infrastructure and I plug those new capabilities into there, can I get an improvement cycle speeding and getting better too? This is great. That's what led me into the particular kind of capabilities here that we call the collective IQ.</div><br><div>\tTo better way to frame this and build and work on and develop the ideas underneath that box are the same kind of things we can put into the improvement structure etc. Then it says, \u201cYou're making headway. You're getting this collective IQ pursued etc.\u201d Then you need some there's one massive kind of requirement based upon this that you find these magic things that work for Procter & Gamble well you got to make sure that you can also work with the outside world and not island.</div><br><div>\tThis interoperability and we right at the time in the ... the company that bought us from Stanford Research Institute and the commercial time sharing business got bought up by McDonnell Douglas so I could have a chance to go and talk to the heavy industry people about their use of it. It was really terrific to find out how you could probably augment the whole process by which you develop an airplane design. Not only that by the concurrently how you develop the manufacturing capability to do that. Not only that, by how you develop the community of top level suppliers who have to co-design things in your aircraft like that.</div><br><div>\tNot only that, by how you can interoperate with the end users which have a great deal of interaction back and forth as you do the logistic support and the upgrading of models and something like that. This interoperability was great. Then this kind of a picture of the in the end what's got be needed out here is a globally interoperable open hyper document system. We just invented that name in the late \u201880s as just saying it's inevitable. It's got to be hyper linkage multimedia and it has to be an open system. The html kind of thing in there is just proving that case where you can dive around and get into there.</div><br><div>\tIt doesn't mean it can't be all folded up and tucked away in a database system at all but conceptually it's still a document when you unfold it for the viewing etc. and then like that. There are a lot of things if we dig down underneath that box there are a lot of things we did in there that are still open for exploration and such that other people haven't done. Then there's a question of deploying all that which is a very important thing as you make headway within your organization how best to deploy it from a strategic point of view.</div><br><div>\tOut of that comes one of the important pictures about high performance teams that are selected and recruited and equipped and trained to be really high performance knowledge workers on new levels that you can't get by, by just getting to be good at what the current products can be harnessed and such like that. There's a need to prototypes like that. Then you need to find ways to deploy them within an organization so they not only can effectively utilize that extra capability they have but that their interaction with that has a way for the other people in the organization to see and rub shoulders and get the feeling for what you're going to do if you can get trained etc. to new levels.</div><br><div>\tThis means in this open hyper document system you need a way in which you can have multiple grades of user proficiency with the appropriate interfaces for them and such. A lot of these strategic stuff comes out and if we possible to go after then you start talking about \u201cThen how you can do that if you have an improving infrastructure it's appropriate in the organization.\u201d Then you can actually hike that structure and move it up a little so that you can get coordinating, cooperating communities of organization saying \u201cThere's a lot in common that we could collectively work on that would help us improve our improvement process.\u201d</div><br><div>\tIt goes on from there but that's the high level thing and we can spend 3 days and look deeper into it but I'm not going to. There are some really key things especially up in here and here and here and here.</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tI think it would be quite interesting if you might be to share by way of example or concept the A, B, C approach that is in here but you didn't quite lay out in that very straightforward fashion like we did with [Dirk 00:35:35] earlier today. The concept here is Doug teases up is any organization is operating its business or its government a certain way today and probably every organization is trying to improve the way they do that. The first is A and the improvement is B. the thing that I found fascinating and elegantly simple in Doug's thinking is there's C how do you improve the way you improve and get that ROI curve to be compounded as opposed to incrementally growing. If you could tell us a bit more about that that would be great.</div><br><div>Doug:\tIt started with if you have a human and tool system you're augmenting your organization and you're going to want to go through this set of thinking. You start categorizing the activity that you find in the organization. Everyday chunking along away and that includes hiring people and training them to do the jobs that are there today and doing product development the way you do and selling etc. etc., etc. If you're trying to improve any part of your augmentation system, then you put on a different hat and just give it a different name say its B activity. It's not an inventing new activity, it just inventing a label that helps do some thinking in a certain way.</div><br><div>\tThen the idea if you're coming into an era of much more rapid complex change whereas B has been semi casual thing through all the years who put up a cross functional committee to do something that's going to improve this or that packaging or something. They work at it together and do their thing and it gets changed or you get a consultant to come in and make plan of change. You say, \u201cB is going to be so much more critical and we're going to live and die by it as much as we live and die by anything we do in any world.\u201d You say, \u201cYou want to improve that then you need to realize that if its serious work you got to give it another category.\u201d This A, B, C emerged and it really has helped a lot as basis for that infrastructure. You had some comments?</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tThe thing I find fascinating about this l think Procter & Gamble probably does a pretty good job with A&B but I'm not sure we thought too much about C. C being a catalyst or synergizer that improves the way you improve. Any company that can start to systematize that in the way they think about their business and how they're going to improve their business is going to end up with a competitive advantage because you're immediately thinking about beyond today's improvement. It's how do you improve the way you improve. I found that very compelling and very powerful especially for a company with intrinsically a high collective IQ.</div><br><div>\tProcter & Gamble is a company of 106,000 people. We try hard to hire the brightest and best people we can around the world. We try to give them stimulating, challenging jobs and work. If you collect all the IQs of those 106,000 people, it would be a rather awesome chunk of brainpower there. I think most of our brainpower frankly is in A. Pick a number? 75% maybe 29% whatever ... I'll bet 1% is of our work is on C. I have no idea if you all would share that perception but that's the way I feel about it having worked across a variety of businesses.</div><br><div>\tWe're so busy running hard at A that maybe Friday night on the way home to catch a glass of wine or a beer you might think a little bit about B and forget C it's not on the horizon. I think that's a very compelling, conceptual framework and the role we that we have as information technology professionals I think we need to provide some intellectual leadership on this. If we were to take some part of our business whether it's R&D or product supply or our own business, what would we be doing if we wanted to move more in this direction intellectually?</div><br><div>\tMaybe take a pilot project or some kind and really think it through. We are saying we want to accelerate our ability to innovate and its true we do our corporate sales growth as lackadaisical relative to what we like it to be. Its better this year than last year then I just have a hunch that there's the seed of an idea planted in Doug's concept here that we ought maybe plant somewhere and try and grow. I have no idea what that means when I say that but I find this a very intriguing way to think about how we can change the way we do our work so we have a continuous way of always doing it faster and more importantly better.</div><br><div>Doug:\tThis more maturing to this that you might be interested in if we look. One thing about it is the relationship between them. It's like who's the customer and the supplier. Well between B and A and between C and B that's something to think about it as you're organize C it's trying to help B. then another thing is that any given person might have a B hat on for 6, 8, 2, 3, 4 hours a week or whatever or C hat even and so it isn't that's just special teams of people necessarily. You can get them in there but you have to think of it as activities so you might be engaged in those various kinds at different times. The idea is clear.</div><br><div>\tAnother thing is most industries already know what percentage of their revenue goes back into product R&D but you find out that almost none of them knows about the B much less the C. Since well it's going to be a life threatening ... there's another area in here if we think about moving around in this getting collectively smarter and interoperable and deploying like this was this thing we talked about this collective network improvement community.</div><br><div>\tLet's just a look about that and saying suppose here's Procter & Gamble and yes we recognize that. We want to get better at doing C etc. well there some of the characteristics about that that are interesting. We say, \u201cDown the street come on what's the matter. There's organization number 2 and we could probably find a number them that we some kind of interest in collectively. Should we stay away from our competitors or do they have to be near us the same or what. Let's just say what we're interested in is sharing the C work and say, \u201cLet's consider in somehow making an alliance among ourselves that for a given set of improvement capabilities.\u201d</div><br><div>\tWe're trying work inside our A that mean our B's have in common between ourselves because we're all interested say in knowledge management or something like that. We can share a lot of the work of building up the new C stuff without giving away proprietary stuff up here in the A and all and the B like that but they'd be very important. The thing then next the challenge is to say, \u201cHow many things are there that we can do collectively at that C level that pay off, that it sort of multiplies the results that we get?\u201d You'd say, \u201cWell there's a lot.\u201d We can make it a quiz. Can we get them a quiz to see if they're awake?</div><br><div>\tIntelligence collection about what's going on in the outside world. For instance, if this is something that they're interested they just pick knowledge management that we want to improve. What's going on in the outside world? Part of the tools that are being developed. What are the practices they're doing? How do we analyze that? Can we collectively fund some real work at doing scenario development out there so that we get a better feel? Can we collectively invest in some pilot operations to shake things down? There's a lot like that. Can we have some training in there for people?</div><br><div>\tWhen I looked at your catalogue and the other network things that you guys ... that were demonstrated for us the time before you all came this very impressive thing. You look at it and says, \u201cWe need to do that same thing for the knowledge that every B in here needs in order for this thing.\u201d Then what kind of experience can we provide because a lot of the implicit knowledge doesn't come just with what you can give them like that. What you need to do is get people that rotate from working in this B are to coming into the C and helping do this work here.</div><br><div>\tYou'd like to invest enough collectively in the C so you're using the most advanced capabilities and tools that you can actually do and actually piloting some things that are downstream so we all get to learn about it. Back in some of the other boxes we get down we look at the market place and say why it needs an infrastructure like this and etc.</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tI'd like to open this up a little bit rather than make this a dialogue up here with myself and Doug to invite you to ask questions or make comments and stimulate other discussion and ideas. Why don't we open this up to anybody who'd like to ask a question? Patrick your hand is up first.</div><br><div>Patrick:\tI have basic questions to better understand the A, B and C. I'm going to give an example of how we work and see [inaudible 00:45:41] When we introduce a new system in a plant for example to improve the plant working and about [inaudible 00:45:49] management. A few years ago it would take us 12 to 18 months to do plant. Today you are in a system that we can do a plant in 3 or 4 months bringing that to 18 to 3 or 4 months, do you consider that a C activity or is that B? You understand the question?</div><br><div>Doug:\tThat was a B activity. You're actually designing and implementing that improvement and getting it up ...</div><br><div>Patrick:\t[inaudible 00:46:22] Implementing the system and 18 months was a B activity to improve the way the people did so implementing is possible [inaudible 00:46:33].</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tLet me try a translation and have Doug come in. what seem to me that the original plant activity was an A 12 to 18 months and the B was getting it down to the lesser number. I think the point Doug would make and please speak for yourself Doug would be how do you take that and improve that. That would be true C get it down to 1 month for example. I don't know if I've said an appropriate analog back to your model.</div><br><div>Doug:\tIt comes to that. Building a new plant is an A. you're doing it but unless you're doing that better than you used to do before, then it wasn't a B but if you got a process for building a new plant that really does it a lot better well implementing that was a B process. Finding out how to do it and getting the ideas and stuff would have been C. if you'd been going to conferences etc. and investing energy and getting the position where you could do that that would be a C. It gets more subtle and especially it gets more subtle when we go on for other stages about this kind of infrastructure because I like saying here we call a network improvement community a NIC.</div><br><div>\tYou look around saying, \u201cThere are a lot of improvement communities and if there aren't really network and trying to do it in a modern way we call them an ICK.\u201d The meeting in this bootstrap alliance that we have people interested in that like Sun and Netscape got in nearly a year and half almost 2 years ago to say \u201cHey let's start making this happen.\u201d This encourage us we got more people and success is set a quarterly meeting its just getting more and more dynamics going on. This concept has evolved in the point of that.</div><br><div>\tOne of the evolutions and I can just show you is in this other sense of here but its saying, \u201cHere's the NIC idea.\u201d In other parts of our presentation there we go on and say any organization is going to have to have a knowledge repository. If it's going to do this collective IQ stuff it just means that you got make shareable knowledge that's available to all the parts of the organism in there like that. Then to all 16, 17 years ago the idea was oriented about there's several discernable parts to that. One is the intelligence collection of what you brought in from the outside world. The other then so you're recording a lot of the dialogue that was on the different ideas and the arguments and all the email and stuff and that.</div><br><div>\tAt one point in some sense the catalogue part that was shown here earlier there's the knowledge product. What is it today that you can bomb into to find out the situation that we understand? What's the applicable knowledge that's available today in here? It can't just be all of the undigested stuff you find here. We have to find a digestion integration process. Remember that [Kodiak 00:50:09] idea was developing, integrating and applying. The applicable knowledge here has to be in a form that's accessible to reach is really useful know.</div><br><div>\tIn a sense it's like electronic handbook about how you can do your work. In this case because this is a NIC it'd be electronic handbook of how the Bs can better do their work. They're going to be busy investing and building the same things for their respective A groups so it's a very interesting way in which the propagation can go and all of that.</div><br><div>\tThen we got to thinking about \u201cWell that's going to be very important. Oh, well then what about this?\u201d This was a shift that occurred then a year or so ago and saying \u201cIn the alliance we want to make that really would be benefit is we want to make a NIC of NICs, alliance of NICs so that the role of this one is how do you get your NIC to be better and better?\u201d You're going to have NICs pursuing all kinds of things and this provides a meta level improvement infrastructure that the more you think about it, the more potency it has.</div><br><div>\tIt's like saying, \u201cYou guys could go in and you have 1 particular kind of processing interest maybe.\u201d I'm staying away from the knowledge management because it's so universal but say there's a certain kind of processing capability or chemical processing or manufacturing that you know could be improved or the quality movement was an example. That you can find other organizations who could share the C level stuff about that collectively going after it. You all need to know you have together establishment better and so getting the basic capability and so how you're doing improvement can be pegged.</div><br><div>\tWe're finding quite a few examples of that out there like that. Then you say, \u201cIf you formed a NIC like that and became part of the alliance, then collectively you invest time and energy in here too to do things that you're going to have to do anyway.\u201d This is a current picture and we've got some interesting emergent NICs lined up to come to that etc. this is the kind of way it's going where you can even think about a national improvement infrastructure based on this. Forming, getting it to some kind of NIC would be a payoff to Procter & Gamble which I think in the end you'd get in there and you probably find quite a few special interest NICs that would be very relevant for you to participate in.</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tVery interesting. Ted?</div><br><div>Ted:\tI'm interested in hearing more about the 30 years from now applications of that power you talked about in your handbook. What kind of application would you see [inaudible 00:53:08] computer surgery with no incision or it finds the right spot that internally ... what do you see?</div><br><div>Doug:\tYou chug your imagination all over but you'll know that that will make so much bandwidth available in any kind of wireless form that you carry around with all you need. It might even be surgically implanted so that it gets the energy it needs metabolism. While it's at it, it keeps a check on your white count, what's going on and everything like that and really do a lot of monitoring and actually therapeutic biochemical therapy. Then you say, \u201cCan it intercept signals in a lot of my nerve channels?\u201d Well yeah. Could that help [amplify 00:53:59] my sensory capability? Probably. You can just really go in to things like that where you could just start to become a bionically amplified person and some of this is really horrifying or revolting but it's apparent.</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tIt sounds like fun to me.</div><br><div>Doug:\tThe other one is saying like why would ever have to go someplace because you can get the same sensations provided to you as being at any place etc. so why would you move around and so oh to be very efficient because the population has grown so much that you've got space wise you've got about 6 \u00bd feet by 2 feet by 3 feet and that's your space in the world and you never have to leave it because you can be connected out there and you can be fed intravenously of course etc. This is a very hyperefficient world some people could picture and it makes me sick.</div><br><div>\tWhereas we could also go about saying, \u201cBy that time we could be collectively smart enough so we could understand social and political dynamics enough to get some kind of stability there and really understand where empathy and bonding and all of that come from so we could actually design and implement and maintain a rational human centered earth that could be really terrific.\u201d Before that comes with either those options they're likely to be traumatic dislocations that occur because globally we're not smart enough to cope with a lot of the changes.</div><br><div>\tLook at the Asian financial crisis catching us by surprise. Why the hell did it surprise us? See we weren't smart enough. We're managing it now. What's next? It just seemed to me with horrendously compelling something or other that if there's really something to this potential of boosting your collective IQ, getting after that as early as we can to forestall some of the calamities which could end up ... a crisis happened which the whole financial thing collapsed and to think through what would happen if the global financial structure collapsed one afternoon, what would happen?</div><br><div>\tYou say, \u201cIs there any imaginable process that could get it going again?\u201d Not that I know of. If you had to start all the way up with barter and everything else like that, billions of people would die within weeks. We'd be put back in the feudal age because you'd have to group together with armed combat in order to protect your turf and try to go steal the food that you need to keep your group alive or something. Just horrible scenes about what could happen.</div><br><div>\tThe thing that keeps me going tottering along years after sensibly one would retire is every year sooner that the world take seriously the potential for going after this boost of IQ, boost of [inaudible 00:57:09] deal collectively gives us a better chance for survival. That's what keeps me going. It also happens to give me this slightly zealous approach you know grabbing by the throat and says, [inaudible 00:57:25] but to me it's deadly real.</div><br><div>\tThe potential is really, really there and very exciting but how do you wake up the world to just go after it as a really, really something special not just that we're going to get 10% better next year but says \u201cHey we're going to start taking steps that we can climb the hill and get better at it.\u201d Which pulpit do you listen to on Sundays?</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tOther questions. Yeah?</div><br><div>Speaker 4:\tYou put together these NICs you start working on them to create this knowledge product. You need to work together you mentioned on slide here around collaborative [inaudible 00:58:10]. What do you see over the next 5 to 10 years? From a collaborative tool standpoint, how do you see that working? What should we be looking at as we think about how to help our people collaborate better?</div><br><div>Doug:\tIf I lived up to what I've been doing, I'll have to make an indirect approach to that. The way I'll do it is go back up to another potential there. First I want to show you what this picture is. This emerged about 1961 and technology guide thinking \u201cOh boy we're going to do all these things.\u201d Slowly I begin to be aware of things over in this side. Finally I start to list them. That just sobered me up so much that if anything I've been more leaning on that side even though I get applauded of the things in here.</div><br><div>\tI keep saying, \u201cThe only way that going to get harmed is by changes in here.\u201d That's really, really ... I can't emphasize it enough in any image about the changes of that stuff like that. You have to think of the cooperative changes with that thing and there like that. This led looking at a picture like this or the saying \u201cI've got my tools.\u201d</div><br><div>\tTechnology is changing and improving in this direction and it's just exploded that normally relative to where organizations are today in harnessing technology with whatever human system they do, they would all be used to living in this first quadrant down there that the technology is only moving advancing that far ahead of what we already used but suddenly it spurting here like that where their capabilities that you know could be built that wouldn't know how to reintegrate into an organization.</div><br><div>\tWe can go to examples of that but it's just really the case. This things of saying that that's where you can look at the current market place and realize hey the vendors aren't responsibility for telling you much about what's out there. They're responsible to their stockholders for capturing the market that's evolving out here. They need to be good at hyping and telling and guessing at sort of like that because ... we're talking about organizational utilization so the end user organization so just not been proactive at all about being in this, about what could they do if and how would they employ it and what do they need and what are the standard stuff that they need.</div><br><div>\tThey're passively being led around and that's just not going to do them ... the big example I point to is the computer world ignored the network. All this network stuff started in 1970 so say it was early 80s it was really working. It wasn't until 90 something 3 or something like that they got ... where you couldn't tell them that that was going to be critically important. Sun Microsystem says, \u201cHey the network is the computer.\u201d It just wasn't there and yet that's such a tremendously important thing to end user organization.</div><br><div>\tJust as examples unless end user organizations get proactive about starting to explore for themselves conceptually instead of what's here and funding some things that give prototypes out there that like the frontier out there saying, \u201cWe need to think outpost out in that frontier that help us know what's there.\u201d Otherwise Procter & Gamble as progressive it might be, goes wandering out on here and falls of a cliff or gets mired in a swamp.</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tThis is a very challenging area. I go for example to Microsoft every 6 months for a global executive round table. Because of the nature of the church of the technology and the pace of which it is moving and the competitive focus and all the end users who buy all this stuff are really the tail on the duck. It's very difficult to get any insight. In my view that's very meaningful going on the right side of the axis things that are coming in 3 to 5 years even 1 to 2 years like [NT50 01:02:54] where is it when ... and that's like right here but further out its very, very difficult.</div><br><div>\tI don't know whether it's because they don't know or they're afraid to talk about it but it make its very hard for companies. We as industry have invested a trillion dollars in information technology most of which will be obsolete very shortly. That's not a good deal. We have to have it. we have to use it but I'd be interested in taking this subject area and coming back to IT organizations for a minute given the reality of the way the world is working today what we really swept along by the tide of technology and technology companies what would an intelligent IT organization look like to you for a company like Procter & Gamble. How should we be organized? What should we be thinking about in this whole area? If you were CIO what would you do?</div><br><div>Doug:\tFirst I'd have to go to school and learn how to be a CIO.</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tThere isn't one.</div><br><div>Doug:\tNo. One of the real problems for me is if you're an outsider because you're not saying things that people can hear and gawk into their world, if you persist in staying there because you think it's important, you're not getting experience that would it take to know how inside an organization what you have to do. In that concepts and the needs I feel very confident about the general structure of all of this but coming and saying, \u201cHey I think the CIOs you got to get into a community of CIOs and start helping yourselves work out a lot of the pictures.\u201d</div><br><div>\tI can give a lot of what ifs and go find other people that can add things to it but I don't think there's anybody right now that ... what's that frontier mean to CIOs, human resources and other hugely ... they just have to cooperate. Human resource I guess whoever is responsible for how to help map the new roles and organizational structure and the new kind of skills that you're going to take for granted that people are going to have to have in order to live in this new way. They're all very important things in that dimension. It's the cooperation.</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tFair enough. You might be interested to know Doug I don't think we've shared this. We have an active project right now in the company being led by our chairman and by our president [inaudible 01:05:27] John Pepper it's called the Year 2005 Project. It's basically aimed at the very types of things you are talking about. What are the things we're going to need to do in the future to be successful but an important element on the human dimension was well as the empirical dimension not just IT but a lot of other thing are indeed as well.</div><br><div>\tWe are starting to address this in a much more thoughtful, planful, comprehensive way and hopefully not an insular way. We're bringing another company who's had a lot of experience helping companies go through this process of trying to figure out what's the world going to be like? What are the scenarios out there and then how do you organize against those today? Other questions, comments, issues for Doug? It's hard for me to see who's out there please. Go ahead.</div><br><div>Speaker 5:\tQuestion about what kind of staffing if you had a company of 100,000 people, what would you think would be right in terms of the amount of staffing put against new frontier activities? Can you give us the feel? I'm sure a company like Procter & Gamble have a quarter of its people focused on that kind of thing?</div><br><div>Doug:\tI don't know enough about the business operation. It's the kind of thing that I think progressive companies need to get together and try to start working on themselves. That's all the C level stuff in there. I just know that what's there now isn't going to be able handle the rate of change that's coming about. In trying to get this meta next stuff going and the next ... the CIOs just need to combine or human resources or the combined and collectively start doing that.</div><br><div>\tScenario development you just got to have a lot of that going on. One of the real questions, is this an infrastructure? Can the current kind of infrastructure a lot of times you outsource to consultants something like that to do you're B and maybe C. Where did they get it this advance C? Then they get proprietary about the approach that they start selling instead of sharing out there like that. It just seemed to me that the kind of end user organizations involved in these cooperative stuff and they could collectively fund somebody to do studies and scenarios but they're plugged into the whole community's knowledge base and stuff like that.</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tOther questions in the back. I really can't see that far. Please.</div><br><div>Speaker 6:\tIn your graph on the screen here I think reflects the challenge that P&G is facing today which is [inaudible 01:08:11] bottom will continue to take advantage of standardization tools and gain greater benefits by doing that. Generically the people are [inaudible 01:08:19] apply those tools and so the human aspect in order to be objective in these global applications that we try to create. I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on how we take advantage of global opportunities and simplification without losing the inherent creativity and innovation that comes from the individual humans that we have.</div><br><div>Doug:\tThat's one of the primary challenges is integrating the individual contributions and so that combined whole is more effective. I just say I don't have any real answers that they need to get an experiment but there's some of these futuristic things that you pretty sure will happen and one of them is because can work from a distance collectively a lot more effectively it's just a premise that's sure to happen. Then you say, \u201cOne of the things that will come about that is the kind of special knowledge and capability that individuals develop could be sold.\u201d</div><br><div>\tYou could be integrated to a wider range of activities so where it used to be you'd have to be collocated in order to be part of a team then you couldn't afford to have a specialist in there who would only be useful for 1 week out of the 3 months period or something. With this new kind of way of collective working you can bring people in for 6 hours or 2 hours or 10 days from any place in the world so that for individuals that they could start becoming much deeper specialized people and still be saleable but then you realize that some way about integrating the body of knowledge that's there you're going to have to have people who specialty goes across here up and down here or this way or like that.</div><br><div>\tIt's going to be very important in the way to find a way to integrate rapidly what's going on that that implicit experiential knowledge that somebody who is a specialist across tracks does. The ability for then much more we find deep specialties of various kinds, it's going to be a new kind of market place for people and for the way organizations work. Did that come anywhere near meeting your question?</div><br><div>Speaker 6:\t[inaudible 01:10:35]</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tSure.</div><br><div>Speaker 7:\tI think the real challenge for P&G specifically is understand as we try and develop technology solutions for a global organization that global organization is made up of many smaller organizations with very different needs. When do we start have diminishing returns on our efforts to be global versus trying to meet those individual needs and more important how do we discover the balance?</div><br><div>Doug:\tThe engineer would say, \u201cThere just have to be a bunch more built and start burning what they were.\u201d The business about how long do you keep trying to be global if it's starting to make the different components get in trouble, that's one of the things about the interoperability and things like that. That's a very basic out there in society problem that in the end they're going to be integrated into a global capability, the whole connection like that. Somehow if there are barriers to that quietly and respectfully for what people need ... as humans need to be done with they're just one of the problems. Knowing how far to go is trying to appreciate that you may get into what looks like bobby traps and that \u201cMy god, am I going to have to fire everybody over 50?\u201d Their skills are out of date now.</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tAssume we can't learn new ones Doug. I would just say on the Procter & Gamble specific implications to that question my own view would be that we have so far to go to gain the benefits of globalizing our worldwide operations including our systems and our global internets and all that we're going to press forward very aggressively toward that and look for the offsets and the balances to make sure we don't standardize to a point where we fail to keep the innovative and entrepreneurial capabilities and the variety of things we need as a global company to be successful.</div><br><div>\tI would say in our view in the top of the company at least that I would say 80% to 85% of what we're trying to do is take advantage of our scale through getting rid of our default to difference culture to a default to convergence culture and get the benefits out of that which I don't think we're yet 10% of the way toward really, really achieving even though we've done a lot. There's so much more ahead of us. We have about 5 more minutes here. Anybody got questions wave. Robert?</div><br><div>Robert:\tI've got a question on information overload. If you think about the amount of information that is available to us, the human mind can only take in so much and then retain so much. We all face the [information overload 01:13:42] as I think about your comment about 30 years from now being able to hold in the palm of your hand the equivalent the computing capability that existed in the world today my question to you is, how do you envision IT information technology helping with the whole dilemma on information [culture 01:14:04]?</div><br><div>Doug:\tIt provides the facilities by which you can experiment with how humans with whatever you learn about their capabilities and tolerances and capacities, how they can integrate their respective capabilities into a collective group. Obviously it won't be functionally effective if the individuals are subject to just total overload. There's some question about how much more can they manage if they have the right kind of skills and training and tools as well as the conventions by which the organization's knowledge is organized etc.</div><br><div>\tYou just say, \u201cThat becomes the roles.\u201d That people have to have roles in which they're not exposed to over I'd like that and then you say, \u201cHow are we going to do that?\u201d That technology guy say we've got things to offer. This emergence now what they call intelligent agents and it's a little different from what the artificial intelligence people in the past used to do but to harness some of their things. Anyway, those can help be support capabilities for people so they could take off some of the kind of shock of what's going on. Anyway, it's just something to learn and work out.</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tIn a sense we're in the middle of this now if you think about it. 25 year ago all the computing people in the world you could probably put on your PC today. The next 25 years is really just an extension of that. I guess Ted you might give the last one.</div><br><div>Ted:\tIt seems like you spent most of your life pretty far upfront of the world as an innovator and that you were with us very often by the establishment, by the people who working with today's problems. Assuming that's reasonably true, what would say you a bunch of the establishment [inaudible 01:16:20] about ... what advice would you give them about how to treat their innovators to treat people like you were?</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tGreat question. Doug we only have 3 minutes for this answer. You get this down to a 60 second commercial. You can think like a Procter & Gamble person here.</div><br><div>Doug:\tThat comes back to the what's the prevailing paradigms out there so that society is going to be beset by people who are waving their arms and talking about things that other people can't understand. If they'd only turn it into my language, explain it so it's their fault. I recognize that there's that problem and I don't know any answer to it other than that society needs to start adapting its paradigms to fit the times. If the paradigms that are operative aren't up to date, then there'd be people that don't deserve to be pushed under the do something like that.</div><br><div>\tAnyway this is one of the things that we talk about infrastructure that can help shape and adapt and try to help move the paradigm evolution fast enough. That's all I can say because I can't blame people for shunting me off in those days. That was the pervading paradigm. There was no way to give them the experiences that would help shape.</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tI would build 2 other points on top of that one would be that management whoever they may be needs to listen better and be willing experiment more and not take anything for granted but go out and try to learn through some empirical experiences about both the most extreme ideas even though they might not seem as though in the world of the possible with today's paradigm.</div><br><div>\tI would like to thank Doug and Christina for joining us today. I think it's very, very evident that we have a person here who 30, 40 years ago is thinking as far into the future as to be able to see what we're seeing today and continues to do that as he has demonstrated with his traipsing around the conceptual model of the bootstrap idea into the next 30, 40 years. I think it's truly remarkable. We're truly honored to have you here and thank you very much for coming.</div><br><div>Doug:\tDon't go away. Christina said, \u201cLet's give a gift.\u201d I said, \u201cFine.\u201d We have a gift. She made us late this morning by getting it wrapped.</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tIt's a ... go ahead.</div><br><div>Doug:\tI'd love to hear what you thought about it.</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tI just realize I was about to put my foot in my mouth so I better shut up.</div><br><div>Doug:\tI was given an award for the World Wide Web conference a couple of years ago. The guy who put this up to generate that he got in touch secretly with Christina and so they got together some of the things we published in the past and condensed it into a neat old booklet. They produced a limited published bound thing. They're signed by both me and Tim Berners-Lee and like that. Here's one just for you.</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tThank you.</div><br><div>Doug:\tMeeting him was great and the things I've learned today about your organization, you really are doing better than anybody we've met. Don't let it go to your head. Anyway, we appreciate very much the exposure here.</div><br><div>Speaker 1:\tThank you for coming.</div>",

            "I would just say on the Procter & Gamble specific implications to that question my own view would be that we have so far to go to gain the benefits of <b><b><b>global</b></b>izing</b> our worldwide operations including our systems and our <b><b>global</b></b> internets and all that we're going to press forward very aggressively toward that and look for the offsets and the balances to make sure we don't standardize to a point where we fail to keep the innovative and entrepreneurial capabilities and the variety of things we need as a <b><b>global</b></b> company to be successful.",
            "Speaker 1:\tThe thing I find fascinating about this l think Procter & Gamble probably does a pretty good job with A&B but I'm not sure we thought too much about C. C being a catalyst or synergizer that improves the way you improve.",
            "Speaker 1:\tA visitor here, at Procter & Gamble this afternoon, Doug Engelbart, who is sitting next to me here, is a man of extreme eminence in the world of information technology, as you all know.",
            "Forming, getting it to some kind of NIC would be a payoff to Procter & Gamble which I think in the end you'd get in there and you probably find quite a few special interest NICs that would be very relevant for you to participate in.",
            "Based on that dinner, where Christina was also present, I decided to invite Doug to Procter & Gamble to take a look at what we were doing, and also let him share with us particularly all of you his thoughts and ideas of what's been happening in the world of information technology, in the past as well as into the future."

        "full": "<div>Douglas:\tIt's a privilege to be here. The combination of terms in the titling of your conference are just very stimulating. I'm going to unload on you a lot about what I've been committed to about the future. It may seem like it's not terribly compatible with what you're doing now but I believe so strongly about what is going to come about and what we need to start thinking about, that I just have to take the opportunity.</div><br><div>\tIt begins with what my goal has been. This is the wording here that's very appropriate. It says, \"As much as possible, my lifetime goal has been to boost mankind's collective capability for coping with complex, urgent problems.\" This literally is what started me off in 1951. Before there were computers anywhere this side of Boston I guess, or something like that.</div><br><div>\tI went to Berkeley, to graduate school. They were building a computer then. By the time I got my PhD and left it still wasn't working. The reason I left Berkeley, I had assumed I would settle down and become a professor and do research because how you could use computers interactively, etc. was the big picture I had.</div><br><div>\tI'd been a radar technician in World War II for the Navy. I'd seen what electronics could do to paint pictures on a radar screen and how the electronics could watch an operator turn cranks and push buttons. Hearing that computers could print punch cards and print, I just knew that there'd be no technical problem at all for them to draw anything you want at all on a telescope.</div><br><div>\tAlso, to watch a human operator so that interact [inaudible 00:02:15] suddenly got the image that people could start learning brand new ways in which hey could externalize the symbols and use symbology in order to represent the concepts that they were dealing with in their head, and that the options for just totally different ways of actually harnessing your cognitive capabilities or sensory capabilities, were just there. Wow. It's something to go after.</div><br><div>\tI had this interesting first experience that was to enlighten my life, I guess you could say, for some time after that. I got my PhD and I was an Acting Assistant Professor in EE and I was teaching courses and early courses in computers, etc., before there were any to work with.</div><br><div>\tOne Saturday at a barbecue, one of the older faculty from a different department was hearing what I was talking about and he says, \"Well, Doug, do you understand how a promotion is made in universities?\"</div><br><div>\tA big part of the story is what a green country kid I've been all these years. Na\u00efve about things. \"Well gee, no.\" He says, \"There's something called, 'peer review.'\" He says, \"If you don't have positive peer review, your papers aren't going to get published in journals that make a difference, and your ratings aren't going to be good. I can tell you if you keep pointing at something like this, you'll be an Acting Assistant Professor forever.\" I believed him. That was the first of a whole set of experiences that have been going on through the years that were about paradigms.</div><br><div>\tIf what you're trying to tell the world doesn't fit into the prevailing paradigms, it's just a really, really tough problem in trying to get people to listen. I know I've been on the other side of that enough to know that you could say, \"Why doesn't this guy explain it to me in terms of my world, he's trying to get me to understand it. He should explain it to me so I get it, not in his own terms of that sort. THere's just a very basic sort of a situation.</div><br><div>\tThis goal has been fixed in my mind and pursued year after year and there are some very spectacular periods in which we made a lot of headway. Then we ran into peer reviews. For instance the mid '70s where we had systems we were hypermedia group ware, outline processing, working in a different distance. You could do shared screen anyplace in the [opernet 00:04:44], etc. The rest of the world was talking about office automation. That there really is a secretary. What you see is what you get, was a big deal, etc. You've got to have it easy to learn and natural to use, not like in the [bart 00:05:00] system over there.</div><br><div>\tOur research funding just disappeared. We had this marvelous system we had to take out the rest of the world to start using it, etc. like that. Just year after year there was very strong lessons about that the prevailing paradigm is just extremely critical about how the world selects what it's going to see about the future and what it's going to do about the future.</div><br><div>\tWe could've had hypermedia worlds much sooner. You couldn't tell the personal computer people about this. It wasn't until this marvelous thing happened, the Worldwide Web started expanding. Suddenly there was ways for people to get experience. The experience shifted the paradigms. Now people are beginning to talk a lot more about it.</div><br><div>\tYet what I want to tell you about is it still isn't happening about what the paradigms are about what's happening and what's going top happen, what's possible, and how you can make it happen. I'm still pointing like this. Yes, I think I'll still be an Acting Assistant Professor. I've never made it beyond.</div><br><div>\tAnyway, this is a big goal. Much as possible to boost mankind's collective capability for coping with complex, urgent problems. All right. An interesting observation that purposeful pursuit of that goal is itself a complex urgent problem. Instead of letting that defeat you, you can say, \"Ah, so there was 1961. Ah.\" I said if we start making headway and learning how to deal better with complex, urgent problems, let's turn and apply as much of that as we can to the task of improving our capability to deal with complex, urgent problems.</div><br><div>\tThe better you get at getting better, the better you're going to get at getting better. How do you like that?</div><br><div>\tThere was an electronic circuit I had learned about int he Navy called the Bootstrapping Circuit. Feed back into back like that. I started calling that the Bootstrapping System. It's there to go after in the future. It's still there. We haven't harnessed it. This is what I'd like to talk more about. What it is that is there to go after.</div><br><div>\tThat strategy, okay. Let's just do this Bootstrapping Strategy. That's been problem. I set up something 10 years ago with one of my daughters called the Bootstrap Institute to say let's raise a flag and see if we can get this going. Just as long as you keep peer review away from me, I'll be okay.</div><br><div>\tReally, the proposals have gone out, then we get it back and it says, \"Other people are already doing this and they're farther ahead,\" which they haven't shown the light of day about what that is yet. Every one of you is subjected to this same sort of thing so that at yet you're part of what establishes the prevailing paradigm. It's just like you've got this double responsibility of how do you help shift the paradigm so that it's more realistically attuned to what's happening and what's going to happen in the future. Let's deal with that a little bit more.</div><br><div>\tI'm getting a chance. We've got some funding to run a 10-week, 3-hour week colloquium that's going to be webcast starting in January. It's something I invite people to do. It's a chance to start trying to bore in in-depth along these aspects to establish on the one hand the sort of prevailing opportunities and the paradigms that are there, and yet because of the scale of what is happening, and is still ahead of us, the scale of it requires new ways to thinking and working.</div><br><div>\tI said okay, and also you could set up a sort of a strategy to see if that's ... Anyway, I'll get to this. Let's go.</div><br><div>\tThis is a little just announcing what we're going to be doing there. We just walk with people getting on. We're hoping we could harness some of the response of people.</div><br><div>\tThis paradigm issue is just very, very, very significant. It's just true. The face of the greatest avalanche of pervasive global changes ever faced by human society. This technology that is emergent, it's making a lot of change. What we don't generally realize in our world is that this is the biggest traumatic sort of [inaudible 00:09:57] in society is happening faster and it's just beginning to happen really fast on such a global pervasive nature that it's bigger in a qualitative and quantitative sense than any society ever had to accommodate to.</div><br><div>\tThe only way that I can make something that is in some way parallel-</div><br><div>Speaker 2:\tWe want to hear you better, Doc.</div><br><div>Douglas:\tOh, that's the way to get better peer review. Thank you, Larry.</div><br><div>\tThe scale of change, it's just ... I did a study about scaling electronic components in the '50s. I was so committed to the computer, interactive use was going to be extremely potent for us, intellectually. Yet it was depending on computers getting cheaper and faster, etc. I did this study about dimensional scaling. There are a lot of already lower in the physical world about how to do dimensional scaling of things. The aircraft people already had it down so that they knew how many other things they had to change in the test scale of a wind tunnel in order to put a model in there and learn useful things about the model.</div><br><div>\tMany things happen. As devices and animals get smaller, gravity makes much less difference to them. All the reflexes are much quicker. As some kind of devices get even smaller and smaller you find that the relationship between different phenomena stop working so well. The things that time constants really get much smaller. Things can heat up and cool down in very, very short order. Some of the phenomena used to work together stop working together.</div><br><div>\tThe one big thing that came out of this was the surprises that are waiting there for people who have been attuned in their unthinking acceptance of the way the world they're in, their attuned to that and they're not oriented about what would happen if changes happen of a scale past a certain point. It just was very clear that a lot of surprises in the scaling world I was looking at and a few years later that just hit me tremendously. To realize that all throughout our society, we've not been oriented about the scale of change. When it's going to happen there are going to be surprises all lover. If we don't get oriented about that scale and the surprises that are going to be there, we're going to have paradigms way out of tune with what's going to happen.</div><br><div>\tThis is a very important thing so the sense that it's a very dangerous situation for a society as complex as ours not to be aware of that and be oriented appropriately for the kind of things that you've got to look for what's going to be surprising and think through it. That isn't happening. Peer review doesn't let it happen. I'm not trying to be snotty about peer review. It's been a very effective sort of way. We just have to realize that in a paradigm shift, we've got to get real shifts gong in there.</div><br><div>\tHere's one of the kind of issues that external environment is just shifting and changing very rapidly. The kind of thing where we're talking about collective capability, it lies within our organizations and our teams and our institutions, etc. They change by funny little step-wise motion. THey're not at all oriented for change at the rate we're talking about here. That's a very dangerous situation.</div><br><div>\tNow that I've explained it, I'll leave it for you guys to solve it, I guess, right?</div><br><div>\tThis exploding rate of change. One of the things is that there're really going to be tough problems. I don't think I can convey to you the whole thing. I could just tell you about it and you can take the words and go with them. You can think about it. Some of these problems are going to be hugely tough to battle, it's going to be happening so fast. Big global changes tomorrow. Real, real problems.</div><br><div>\tOnt eh other hand, look, opportunities. What are you going to do about that? One of them is boosting our capacity for effective, collective action. That's one of the opportunities this technology offers us and we're going to go after it. Boosting our capacity to keep improving. That's the sort of trad-off or balance that's been driving me for a long time. It leads to thinking about things on scales and the nature that don't fit today's paradigm. LEt's go taking a look.</div><br><div>\tOne of the opportunities is that of what I call boosting the collective IQ for organizations. In that respect, the info technology world is dumping stuff out and in the last year or something just really taken off on electrical business, e-business. Big changes.</div><br><div>\tThis thing about human organizations and they're becoming more effective as collective organization, and the sense that it really works to ... It seems very appropriate to call them social organisms. To say look, that they do ... The action collectively sort of bespeaks of awareness, perception, understanding, purpose, etc. You say all right, I could deal with it like that. So what? Then collective IQ, also.</div><br><div>\tHow smart is a given body of people getting together? There are many, many issues we already accept that are going to need to be dealt with collectively. It's going to be more and more and more. They're going to be happening faster and more complex. As our ability collectively to deal with things going to be adaptable so that more quickly we can do that. This is a big problem. Evolution happens, right?</div><br><div>\tSpurred on the one hand by radically improved nervous systems. This occurred to me in the early '60s as hey, this organism picture really is that [inaudible 00:16:20] and the technology is like a really mutation suddenly for social organisms of a radically new nervous system. You say I can make a model of an organism out there and say, \"Hey, if I picture for any biological organism that suddenly they're mutated really extraordinarily advanced nervous stem.\" What's going to happen? If it happens to a worm or a mole or something like that, do I get something that's all title smarter and a little faster? You begin to realize, no. All the organs and their inter-working are going to be different. The musculature and everything else is going to evolve to take advantage of the speed and flexes and all that. It's going to evolve to be extremely different organism. That's what we've got here.</div><br><div>\tThe social organisms called organizations and institutions will have just a real spurt of evolution. How do we foster the kind of evolution we'd like to see? That's a real challenge. Part of it is what you guys are doing. Are you doing it fast enough with a picture about how much change is going to happen? Let's go on and talk about a few more of these.</div><br><div>\tAnyway, the sense then of a large scale way of thinking about how to get the evolutionary environment for organizations appropriately freed up so that they can evolve more quickly and rapidly and smart. Without somebody steering them so there are a lot of interesting things about that that come about.</div><br><div>\tThe thing about every given organization is that it's going about its evolution, then you realize that it's ecological niche is just totally unstationary. It's the things are just changing. All the other organizations are changing. The marketplace is changing. The social structures are changing. Governments have to change. Industry, education, education's going to be under marvelous pressure. You survive if we can get there to thinking about how you use the technology now to do our education. If we get trapped into thinking how we do today's kind of education, we'll miss a big important thing.</div><br><div>\tAlong with the shift in that technology comes things about the for instance the rate at which the world's knowledge is increasing. Somebody made an estimate that in 20 some years, the world knowledge will double about every 3 months. Yo look at that and says oh, that's a scale of change, right? If that's the case, how long is a university's education going to last somebody? Oh. Not very long. That means that most of the significant professional and working roles in society will have to be continuously moving in understanding and knowledge base.</div><br><div>\tThat means that education no longer can just be handled for K-14 and then college and then you're on your own or maybe do some graduate work. It's got to be there continuously. In that continuous thing is going to be who's going to fill that continuous education role? If universities don't get oriented so that they do it then they're going to be out of a job pretty soon.</div><br><div>\tAnother sort of thing happens is that the education is going to be integrated right into the rest of the knowledge work that people do. You can't do it so that the computer supportive co-optive learning and all that has to fit right in with all the rest of the computers [inaudible 00:20:06] operations that they're doing. The whole shift about the way people view things and study things and move around in knowledge space is going to evolve very rapidly. You just look at it and says you have to start right from the first to start getting kids oriented to that. They're not going to be able to through just chunk, chunk, chunk, and now I'm ready. THey'll probably go out and be served in some years as an apprentice. Like that. Over the years you'll evolve with more and more seniority and understanding about complex things like that and the roles will shift and change.</div><br><div>\tIt's going to be an exciting world and where are you guys going to be during that time? After I get through telling you what the problem is and you start solving it then I'll applaud about peer review.</div><br><div>\tThis multiple pressure that for instance any universities and educational system, they've got to change, bu the world around them's going to be changing. It isn't enough just for them to change in order to be able to harness the technology. They've got to change in order for the role of evolution that has to be a lot more dynamic and continuing all through the years. Who's going to do it?</div><br><div>\tThis whole picture about people working together, then, starts to be a core sort of thing. We adopted this sort of a circular thing with the criss crosses to say look, there are going to be people working at different roles and they all have to be able to inter-operate across so these lines that go back and forth say that no set of people in this collective operation can sit there isolated. They all have to be, and we used to just say look, we've got a link from here, we'll pop you over into this world and you have to be able to understand and read it. We can't get isolated kinds of conventions for the way our knowledge packages are created. This leads to a whole bunch of ideas ab out it's got to be more general and things got to move faster and it's going to e changed.</div><br><div>\tHe says okay, and it's going to be dependent upon recorded knowledge for just totally sure. It's going to be in hypermedia form. Beyond. You get along this sort of a thing of okay, here's my social organism. It's interacting with the outside world and concurrently it's integrating, collaborating, developing, learning, reusing, and about 20 years ago we isolated the sort of picture about these 3 kinds of knowledge bases that would be inside that the intelligence collection is okay, what's going on in the outside world we have to keep track of and know about so our organization can take advantage of the opportunities and guard itself against the threats that are out there.</div><br><div>\tIntelligence collection is just totally important. Is this thing still working? Yeah? Then the recorded dialogue, it's just very, very basic to the way in which knowledge gets developed about these supportive interaction, about the different parties involved with everything like that. There's just a great deal more to do about the way that recorded dialogue can be interlinked and back linked and back linked management, etc., so that some comments made 2, 3 months ago that could otherwise get buried. It's there that there's processes to trace back to find out okay, we suddenly realize there's a really basic new approach that we're going to go on and it's a real successful idea. Backtracking on that for the attribution of where that came from will just be very, very important so it doesn't get lost.</div><br><div>\tThe similar kind of thing goes just to look at and says well the conventions about this peer review business and publishing and academic world, it's just simply got to shift. They have to be there provisions so you publish as soon as possible. Maybe only a paragraph or half a page or this or that in a kind of way that dialogue goes along like that, that the essentially the review process is continuous after that to find out how much value that particular observation or fact or something made to there rest of the dynamics.</div><br><div>\tIt may be 6 months to a year later before the swing really finds out how valuable that was but in the current kind of ways of peer review, that would never have gotten published. I bumped into very, very rigid sort of reactions from academics who would tell me, \"You just don't understand. There's no way. THat's the way the whole system works.\" I try to say, \"You don't understand, the world can't move as rapidly as it's going to move and can't take advantage of dynamic knowledge development, etc., that's going to be there if it sticks to sort of old fashioned ways in which knowledge is developed and handled.\" Anyway, there's just a lot there.</div><br><div>\tThis whole scene and then at any given time there has to be some kind of integration that's the equivalent of what's the textbook that comes out every so often that integrates the status of a given discipline That's great. That's got to start happening a lot more dynamically and purposefully and not waiting to see which professor somebody is going to come out with it.</div><br><div>\tThe process of integrating the kind of evolving knowledge state so that everybody doesn't have to go trace through all the dialogue and all of that in order to find out what's the current status. It's like a handbook or an encyclopedia that's dynamically up to date. That is a central challenge in how this collective intelligence is going to be able to develop or work.</div><br><div>\tAt the same time, everybody involved in this as this dynamic knowledge is shifting and growing is going to have to be learning and staying up to date with the status of this dynamic knowledge repository. That to me is just the central focus for how collectively we are going to get smarter is a really effective dynamic knowledge repository system.</div><br><div>\tIt isn't going to be that there's just one. Each one of these operating units is going to have its own dynamic knowledge repository about the things it has to know about. At the same time, it's a party of a larger one which also then has to be there. They have to be doing all this concurrently so the world's knowledge is going to be concurrently evolving with lots of pieces of it going like this. The requirements then upon the standards of the knowledge packages, etc. that are going to be dealt with just have to get a lot more open and it has to get broken away from proprietary file structures, etc. All the functionality that's going to be evolving in there just can't also can't be locked in to proprietary software packages.</div><br><div>\tThe open source process or something like that has got to have ... The scale of change and the requirements about adapting to this and this very, very important to pursue, it's just [inaudible 00:27:38].</div><br><div>\tThe real user form the sense of what the information technology world is dealing with really has to be shifting to think of it as the organization. That's where the collective understanding and knowledge is the real target so it comes from individuals, etc., but it's no individual is going to be able to cope with the whole big pictures.</div><br><div>\tThis free market currently for the tools and services won't work without customers that understand what they need. Today's organizations don't. How do you get the organizations and institutions to become really proactively alert about where they're going, what they want to do? Sorry about that.</div><br><div>\tOver and over again it's this explosive change. Organizations have to become proactive in exploring the future goals in pursuit of their paths. The school systems as we said before, they need to say how do we change in order to do our teaching and learning better? Also, our role in society is going to be changing and that has to be the secondary thing that's just as actively important as the other one.</div><br><div>\tWe've devised this term of saying concurrent development integration and application of knowledge to represent the set of capabilities that go along with boosting your collective IQ, if you want to have it like that.</div><br><div>\tThis open hyper document system we mentioned about that someplace the standards for the knowledge packages have to evolve. They need to go a lot more facilitate all the kind of things you really want to do, capture, integrate manager, merge heterogeneous knowledge, enhance access, maneuverability and the re-utilization, it's got to be scalable and inter-operable across domains, etc. IT's just a really important thing. It has to get broken away from being proprietary stuff.</div><br><div>\tIt'd be like saying somebody is going to own the vocabulary, and oh, it's proprietary, I'm sorry. Hey wait a minute. You've got to really evolve the environment, that vocabulary. What are the nouns you get for the kind of knowledge objects you're going to have in your knowledge repositories? They're going to get much more fluid, the knowledge objects in there. The functions you're going to apply, the verse, etc. are going to get a lot more fluid. They have to evolve in an open way. There's just now say that they can be anchored to some proprietary sort of system. Until that starts to happen, we're locked away form being really, really effective.</div><br><div>\tAnother thing comes about is okay, let's sort of ... Trying to back away from the automation idea that just killed me back in those days like that. There's a list I started making. I said look, the basic genetic human capabilities is what we start with. Oh boy, I could think of all these neat technical things like that. See, the facilities we get and the different media we're having and what tools and such. Oh boy and all these things the engineers can do. Oh boy, oh boy, you know?</div><br><div>\tI said yeah, but how do they get employed? Oh, we've got a few things on another side of another list. Oh. Oh. This was 1961 that this unfolded for me and I said oh, I'm looking all over for what? What's the name of this other system? I assumed I would be able to knock on a door of a university and find out that there was already a name for all of that and it's not culture and it's not society. It's got a much richer sort of thing so I just called it the human system.</div><br><div>\tTo realize that any new thing that's appeared in the right-hand column would cause changes in the left-hand column as it learns to harness the tools. You just say boy, one of the biggest things that I can try to think of a scale to change was the invention of agriculture. That the huge change that made in the whole social operational family, etc. structure on the human system was just huge.</div><br><div>\tI've tried to think of other changes that I know about in human existence that sort of also were very large changes to just get something about saying look, when we're getting technology over here that's going to get so much faster and cheaper and wide-band, etc. than we're even looking at today, within a decade or so that the now technology is just going to erupt on this right-hand side, that means it's pervasive applicability all throughout the world in this is going to change.</div><br><div>\tThat means we're just in for surprises, surprises, surprises on the human system side as we learn to accommodate and take advantage of it and safeguard things and adjust, etc. like that. To me, that was just hey world, this augmentation thing is real. There's no capability that you or your organization has that doesn't bear upon this kind of augmentation system. You just take an untutored, raw human of any age that has never had any conditioning inside a society with different kind of facilities and human system and they'd be totally helpless.</div><br><div>\tIt's learning how to operate inside of this augmentation system that gives you capability. How effective you are etc. in that is still about a lot of motivation and skill and your own basic IQ and stuff. Anyway, that's the thing. He says okay, how much opportunity is there if we start thinking about it, to really boost our collective IQ? I tell you, you start looking in areas, says oh, one of the things about a paradigm that just drove me up a wall is the wizzy wig. What you see is what you're going to get and what they meant in the '70s of what you're going to get when you print it out and making it look exactly like a page of a book was the highest thing. You do your editing on that and then you print it out.</div><br><div>\tStarting in the '60s we were saying, \"Oh look, you have options. You can show all sorts of views.\" One of the views, just show me the first line of every paragraph so I much quicker get an orientation. Oh, well let's organize them hierarchically so just show me the first 2 levels of the document, one line each. Oh. Let me see only a certain content. You started opening up the opportunity for people to experiment with different views. Then you found you could sort things. Then you found you could ask for all sorts of [inaudible 00:35:08].</div><br><div>\tThe wizzy wig just clamped down and it's still a thing that dominates out there. God Almighty, that's like your automobiles had to operate with reigns because that's the natural way to steer vehicles. Really it's that ludicrous of that's the view we have in scrolling instead of other kinds of jumbling around. That kinds of vocabulary you can get for the functionality of how you want to move around and operate.</div><br><div>\tI get big lessons by watching kids on skateboards and says boy, easy to learn and natural to use, huh? Do you even know how guys on skateboards operate unless you're young enough to have learned? Then I watched them one day come zooming along, and they and the skateboard jump over a foot high curb. Go up over it and the skateboard's not tied to their feet, how do they do it? It's a very interesting thing. They had to show me about 4 times with great shows of disgust for this old fart that was ...</div><br><div>\tThe skateboards have this lip that go back and forth in front of the wheels. They come along like that and they jump off there and their back foot stomps on that lip. The whole thing gets anchored up like that. The front foot stops it there and the other foot goes like that and they've got both feet planted lightly on there and sail right on to new height.</div><br><div>\tYou tell me about the ergonomics guy that would figure that out and tell people that that's what you could do. Then you watch the way you drive around in traffic, too. You realize the amount of skill you have and the way you interpret the guy's actions just by a quick glimpse. Is he tracking what he should be doing or is it a little off? Does he see you? This and that?</div><br><div>\tMuch more, looking in the rear view mirror and judging okay, 65 miles and hour, 3,000 pounds of stuff coming right in your trial. I often think about the 1905 people that if you told them that sure, everybody's going to be driving like that, they absolutely wouldn't have believed you. In the first place, mirrors this size were for shaving, not for looking at something like that. Just the skill of doing that.</div><br><div>\tYou realize that the way that technologies offer me the chance to harness our basic sensory perceptual machinery and our cognitive processes and our motor actions like that just asking for a whole shift in that. I'd be willing to bet you that in 10 or 15 years that what you look at now is the way you study something because likely it'll just change drastically.</div><br><div>\tFor one thing, look. Suppose somebody found out and did some experimenting that they have something automatically parsing as it went ahead like that. It showed it to you in color differentiation about the parts of speech that were there. How much quicker could you go scanning for what you want to get out of there and learn about it? I'd be willing to bet it'd make a big difference and yet that would seem totally unacceptable today. It's not easy to learn or natural to use, like rear view mirrors, things of that sort. If there's, there's just different ways of thinking about what the future can have. That means different ways of how we go explore them.</div><br><div>\tAnother very, very important aspect here, this augmentation system was a huge one. Then capability infrastructure is another thing in society so that the technology revolution offers singular improvements throughout many levels and places within the tool human augmentation system. There's a whole infrastructure of capabilities that feed on other capabilities, etc. to give you your net capability.</div><br><div>\tAn individual operates with an infrastructure and there are going to be many changes throughout that that the technology can offer. Even more within an organization. That whole infrastructure is there so the capability infrastructure is an extremely important concept of that. That's something I keep waiting to have the world talk about. Peer review, I guess.</div><br><div>\tThen what's the interface we're talking about? A really, really key one is the human with your augmentation system and the interface between the tool and the human and the total importance of the co-evolution of those things. That's what we have to work on. The automation idea is just sort of doesn't look for that. It's opportunity for you guys when you're talking about changing education and the process of teaching and learning as hey, let's look throughout that whole kind of augmentation system and see about changes.</div><br><div>\tHere is another very interesting thing to me about thinking about the future as saying well, if I simplify to about a tool system and a human system and if I had some way of going through the world societies and characterizing where they fit on this chart. This chart says I can anticipate a human system maybe up to here and a tool system coming up to here. In 20 years it'll be even further out there. Just within that framework, how do I rate different societies?</div><br><div>\tThere's a fairly primitive one, but as primitive as you find them they still have sophisticated language. I start plotting them around the world and it's a pretty magical process. I do it by peer review. You look around and they say there's quite a distribution. How about your organization? We need to be polite to you and let you feel like your organization is up front. We look at them always. There's a distribution like that in the world's organizations.</div><br><div>\tHow are they moving in the space? You sort of feel like they move up to the right and getting more sophisticated harnessing a technology and utilizing of upgraded human systems. Somebody says okay, now how well does this particular one show the future? How about these boundaries out here like that? Let's just say it's probably more like this. That our distribution's like this but the technologies that we can anticipate are out here and an associate changes of a human systems are up here. Oh, great. We have sort of a challenge.</div><br><div>\tOur organizations have been looking with boundaries not very far out and it's slow to move an organization, anyway. Let's just say how about the institutions of education here? Did I go dead? [inaudible 00:42:37] Technology. Physician to the service. Oh that's it. Let's give him a good peer review.</div><br><div>\tYou're faced with educational institutions now that suddenly the world is changing a lot. The devil's thing is they could change very much the way they operate with a new kind of tool and human system combinations. Oh, and at the same time have to realize that the rest of the world's going to be shifting so the education's role in society is going to be shifting, also. You have to be aware of both those simultaneous transitions going through, which is something like saying okay, what's the marketplace going to be for education in the future? It's going to be just very continuous out there and rapid and that starting from very, very early in life, people will start learning how to work with their symbol structures interactively online, etc. in very different ways. The ways they'll start collaborating and learning and teaching, etc. They have to just shift right into the ways that the rest of the world does it on a real professional basis.</div><br><div>\tYou have to watch the kind of things you do in the educational world to see that they merge with what the rest of the world is doing all at the same time as well as give it the continuous thing. Then there's something else that challenges scale in this thing. The rate and scale of change. I don't know how many of you read anything about the term, \"Nanotechnology,\" but it's where it's the explicit pursuit of how you manufacture things with very, very much reduced scale down until you just actually talk about moving molecules into explicit positions. Then learning to make devices and things, including making little factories that assemble, they call them, \"Assemblers,\" that they can assemble molecules in a certain way.</div><br><div>\tOh, one interesting thing is they can go into the garbage and start extracting carbon molecules there and put them in the right kind of form. You end up with diamond. Oh. You're going to use diamond for a structural material. Oh, that's interesting. There are many, many surprises in there. In cases where it really is inevitable now that you're going to be able to have so much computing power. This one guy explained it to me, one way of doing it is yes, you can hold in your hand something that has processing and memory that's equivalent to all of the computing processing and memory in the world today. Is that going to be 15 years, 20 years, or whatever? At the rate it takes the world to get used to that, in 20 years is going to seem like God, suddenly tomorrow you've got to be ready for something very different.</div><br><div>\tThe scale of change has got to be factored into our world. Nanotechnology is for real. They talk about health, they talk about little creatures that you can inhale that will be smart enough to crawl all through your body and find cells that need fixing. They says oh, we'll live longer. Oh. Pretty soon they're saying, why would you even die? Keep your body young forever. Oh. Is that exciting? Who knows what the psychological problems would be if you just keep growing older or something. Who knows what the world's population problems are going to be. Those are just examples of the kind of things that are going to come about. That are going to be big, big, big shifts in changes that the complex world, we need to get smarter about coping with. More of this stuff.</div><br><div>\tMaybe I'll stop here. I don't want to discourage you totally but this is more like what you have to start thinking about is hey, we've gotten used to the world down here and all of a sudden, these frontiers are way out there. The issue is our organizations have to start moving through here. They don't have to, we could all stay like we are now but things are going to start changing and you've got to change to accommodate the change.</div><br><div>\tWho's going to be steering these organizations? Our world is not oriented about evolution on this scale. Organizations and institutions change. Even universities. What's the process by which universities change? Is the process enough that it's alert about all of this to say hey, the very way we teach and work can change. Yes. The very way knowledge is being developed and handled throughout the world is going to be explosively changing. We should be at the forefront of that. At the same time, oh my God, how are we going to keep up? Where are the resources going to come from to let universities start looking for the role that they need to play next. Are they going to get ousted by competitor, commercial educational outfits that'll teach for money? How's the research thing going to happen?</div><br><div>\tEvery research group in the world is going to be part of a knowledge conduit that goes right smooth out into all the rest of the world, back and forth along that conduit. It'll be a very much more dynamic sort of thing from what it is today. It's going to be very much needing academic-like research but academic-like research is going to need to change to fit into that world.</div><br><div>\tOne thing about it is organizations, you can't just go plunk a General Motors out there or even a Stanford University, so what the look is somehow we have to get the best thing in America, the western world we talked about a frontier and had outposts out in there. Some place we need to get special purpose teams of people that are really working in brand new ways that really are representative of how a whole big organization is going to be able to work out there. There are a lot of thinking about that. Without that kind of action in there, how are bigger organizations going to have an idea about where to move in that world?</div><br><div>\tThis comes about the whole idea of an improvement infrastructure. I'll keep laying on all these kind of abstractions. Any kind of organization that became quite clear about 12 years ago saying oh, it would be very useful to characterize the different kinds of activity relative to improvement in an organization. We said let's get these 3 categories, A, B, and C, and the A activity was the way it operates today. All the capabilities you need to do today and operate.</div><br><div>\tIf you're going to improve your capability, then people have to put on a bee hat. The effort of improving augmentation system methods, tools, process, etc., the change and improve the capability to do your A work.</div><br><div>\tB becomes important. Then if things are changing more and more rapidly, you realize you have to start improving the ability of B. It's outlook, etc. And what's going on there so that this A, B, and C became important so it just says okay. If we've got to get our organizations moving more rapidly, we have to start getting them more clear about their A, B, and C. What are the budgets involved in those things? Who's doing it and why don't they go?</div><br><div>\tOne way of characterizing. Here you've got your frontier and you says oh, the C activity is the scout for trying to find out what's going on out there and what would be a good path to do. The B is like the wagon train or something says I'm going to move our organization out. Those two have become much more important than they ever were today, before. You've got an idea about how the infrastructure ideas inside of society and organizations need to sort of operate.</div><br><div>\tThis evolved for us that we get the idea saying oh, here are these different organizations. Universities, what have you? Each of them have customers. They have A, B, and C. Let's assume that there are group universities that they have similar capability improvement targets. Oh. Let's just say one of the things we can do is do a lot of common work at the C level. That's idea of a lot of consortiates that are like that. He says let's characterize that even further. Let's just get it in there so that we say oh, let's just do this and the best way we can about collective work and put the most advanced As we can in the basket of the C people, which is how to help explore out the group.</div><br><div>\tThere are a lot of things that this reflects on that are pretty good. We started saying oh, then you can get even beyond that. This thing we call a networked improvement community, or NIC. Let's say okay, let's say that would be a very important idea. Then let's move up a level and let's make a NIC whose members are NICs. All these different groups and collections that are trying to learn how to better improve themselves and do it with NICs. This is the idea, here.</div><br><div>\tThis is an improvement infrastructure idea that we've been promoting and the possibilities of it becoming actually at national scales. It turned out that Japan got interested enough in this so they formed a Japanese chapter of this Bootstrap Alliance and were trying to point around the world to say hey, national improvement infrastructures would be a great idea. A lot to learn about each other. There are a whole bunch of strategic thinking about the way all this could happen and that this colloquium we're going to be running is going to be trying to tell a story in ways that can get into detail enough and involve people around the world.</div><br><div>\tYou guys are represent an improvement community. The potential for you to start using more and more of the improvement ... You guys could have your own knowledge repositories, more dynamics, you could represent one. At the same time, the things you would generate would be very useful to other ... NICs. He says great. You've got your kind of things would be producing stuff that other NICs would like. They on the other hand, would be doing a lot of very basic collaborative techniques about working on scenarios of the future, about how you do intelligence gathering and collection, etc. and so on that would benefit yours. You says oh, there becomes a bootstrapping idea about what you would cultivate for NICs and how they would work together to support the evolution.</div><br><div>\tI've gone a little too slowly and my time is just about up so I'll just sort of say that all this may seem fanciful, but to me it's just been very, very real through the years. One of the real, real things is how much potential there is for we humans to be able to harness our machinery more effectively so that we can keep up with the understanding of an ever more dynamic and critical world and society to create something that's better.</div><br><div>\tI've just been forced year after year to just say every year sooner that the world gets the idea that we can really go after the collective smarts better, gives us a better chance for survival. That's what keeps me staggering forth in spite of peer review. Anyway. I'd invite you to tune in to this colloquium web casting that we're going to do. I would like it if there are groups that could participate in starting to do some of this collective infrastructure improvement.</div><br><div>\tThank you very, very much.</div><br><div></div>",

        "full": "<div>John Markoff: Hi. My name is John Markoff, and, uh, this is, uh, an event for the ... an interview for the Computer History Museum. I'm speaking with Douglas Engelbart who invented the computer mouse and much of the other technology that went into today's ... that goes into today's personal computers. I wanted to begin, um, by asking you about growing up in Oregon, and, um, my memory is that you grew up on a farm. Um, was it close to Portland?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: It was very, very small. It was just in a small farm area and, uh, where everybody had other jobs, uh, and ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: What did your parents do?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Well, my father, uh, uh, had developed a radio shop. He was a trained electrical engineer so very early radio, he, he said, \u201cI can capitalize on that.\u201d</div><br><div>John Markoff: So you were growing up outside of an urban area, but yet your father was a technical person.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah.</div><br><div>John Markoff: You ... That's the best of both worlds.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Well, the problem is he died when I was nine, and up until then, he's working very long hours in the Depression time to make things hold together.</div><br><div>John Markoff: I see.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: So I didn't get any technology from him.</div><br><div>John Markoff: You didn't grow up amongst the test, the tubes or anything?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: No.</div><br><div>John Markoff: No? Okay. How close to Portland was your, was your home? Was it Portland was the big city or was it ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Oh, yeah, we were about three or four miles outside the city limits.</div><br><div>John Markoff: I see. Oh.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: But it was a beautiful area, beautiful creek running right through our property and into 90 acres of untouched forest that was our backyard and, uh, and so that creek and that forest were terrific. And it was on a dead-end curvy road so it was very quiet and private and ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: And always raining.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: No. I remember two or three days [00:02:00] with sunshine. (laughs)</div><br><div>John Markoff: (laughs) And, um, after your father died, your mom stayed on the ... You, you stayed in the same place. You didn't move. Yeah.<br>Doug Engelbart: No.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Um, did you have any interest in technology while you were growing up, before you left home?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Well, I, uh, I liked to do a lot of things and I would invent things like ... And then I got interested in, in, uh, making a rope and, uh, so I found out that the gunny sacks that our grain came in to ... or our cow feed came in, uh, was strand by strand that I could pull the strands out and tie it and make a very, very long string, and then I would double that and twist it up and then double it again; it would make a rope. And then I would twist that up, and I ended up making a rope about 40 feet long, it was strong enough to her- ... hold my weight. And I would use that for climbing trees, and, um, and, you know, different funny boats.</div><br><div>\tAnd, uh, then one day when I was about 13 or 14, I found a, in an abandoned barn nearby, I found an abandoned car that just intrigued me very much. It had a brass radiator and kerosene parking lights and, uh, it was a 1916 model T Ford.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Oh my, god.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: That's even older than I am, see. (laughs)</div><br><div>John Markoff: Did you make it with ... Did it work or did you make it work again?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah. Yeah, I, I bought it for $10, uh, and, uh, hauled it home [audio glitch 00:03:37] home and spent the next year or so taking it all apart and getting it finally working. So it was just ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: Do you remember roughly how old were you when you did that?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Oh, 15. It's like we could drive on our back roads without licenses. (laughs)</div><br><div>John Markoff: But then you had a car to go to school with too.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Well, that was even [00:04:00] old in those days, it didn't have a ... It was the year before they started at- ... automatically putting on electric starters on cars.</div><br><div>John Markoff: And so you had to crank-start it?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yes, right. And then the electric, the headlights worked off a magneto so the faster the engine ran, the brighter the lights would get. See? And, uh, it was a, it was just a beautiful, little, old car and that, anyway.</div><br><div>John Markoff: You went to Corvallis, a universi- ... The Oregon State University to, to college?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah.</div><br><div>John Markoff: And what did you study?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Well, I, I studied, I took ... There was an engineering student aiming for electrical engineering, but the main reason was the war had started when I was about 16, I guess, World War II, not the Civil War, and, uh ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: (laughs)</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: (laughs) Then, there was a lot of talk about this secret thing called radar and, oh, the Navy had a program; they would train people to ta- ... maintain that. So it sounded so dramatic that, uh, you came into the classroom and they locked all the doors, then they took the, the textbooks out of the locked ... And then you had your class and then you put them all back in the vault and locked it up before they let you out of the classroom. And that just sounded so much, so that's why I started, I said, \u201cWell, I think I'll take electrical engineering because that would be it.\u201d</div><br><div>John Markoff: Do you think there was any connection between your dad's profession and your interest 10 years later in study? Was there a link at all or it was ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: If there were any, it would have been a negative one because when I was 10 or 11, I remember noticing the textbooks he studied in and looking at them and saying, \u201cOh, god, you're too much for me.\u201d So ... But it was that, that the secrecy of radar and the fact that I probably was going to get drafted, so I did get drafted and then I had that training, so I got into that Navy training program.</div><br><div>John Markoff: How many years did you go to school before you were drafted? Did you ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: It was exactly two.</div><br><div>John Markoff: [00:06:00] Ah, I see, so then you were drafted and you were sent off to operate radar systems in the Pacific.<br>Doug Engelbart: Well, I, I had a year's training first, all the basic training in all the kinds of equipment and the maintenance you had, and, uh, then you get to be a certified electronic technician.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Okay.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: And, uh ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: You told me a wonderful story about shipping out to the Pacific.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Tell me the story of, of, of ... This was, this must have been \u201845, 1945.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: It was spring, and that's when I finished the training, and, uh, (clears throat), so they loaded us up on, on an old converted freight ship converted to a troop ship and, uh ... The San Francisco Harbor, but it was just south of the Bay Bridge in there. And, uh, we were all kind of nervous because we were going to go invade Japan, and there were soldiers, marines, sailors mixed there, and the boat backed out and trundled along underneath the Bay Bridge around towards the Golden Gate and out to sea.</div><br><div>\tAnd we just got part way past the Bay Bridge and, uh, the captain came out on the bridge and looked down on us, \u201cJapan just surrendered,\u201d he shouts. Oh my, gosh, you could just see. Then suddenly all ... uh, every, all kind of ... What is it? Propriety or something leaves us. We all said, \u201cWell, for Christ's sake, turn around.\u201d (laughs) And he goes like this and ... But anyway, it was a very different trip, so.</div><br><div>John Markoff: And I remember you hearing, you hearing the sounds from San Francisco as the people began celebrating as they went ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah.</div><br><div>John Markoff: ... out on ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Whistles blowing and ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: Yeah. Um, you had to go to the Pacific anyway. The war was over.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah. You can imagine that they could not, couldn't just stop everybody where they were, and so 38 days later at about 10 miles an hour, we got to the Philippines [00:08:00] and ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: And your job was a radar, radar operator.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: No, a technician that would be maintenance. So it wasn't just radar. Radar, radio, sonar, teletype, any kind of communication electronics and, uh ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: Okay. An, um, you were a reader by that time, a voracious reader? You, you liked to just sort of bur- ... burrow into ... was ... I mean ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Well, that's what I discovered. I had been a reader and curious way back. Then, in early years of college, I found a library and the stacks and how they were tolerant enough to let me go roaming in there. And I just did read a lot and ... huh.</div><br><div>John Markoff: So you found a reading room while you were on ... It was a small island, right? Where, where ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Oh. When we first landed in the Philippines, it's what they called a receiving ship, even though it was a camp in the jungle (laughs), right on the edge of the jungle in the island. And, uh, they dumped the shipload of people there and then you get assigned to different places and, and traveled from there in small groups to different assignments. So, uh, that one was, it was right on the edge of the jungle and, uh, interesting, but I discovered the native Filipino hut on stilts, thatched roof and everything that had a sign on it that said \u201cRed Cross Library.\u201d And, uh, you had to climb up the ladder into the nice, clean floor, about maybe 15 feet across, circular like this and books and magazines. (laughs) It's funny, so I started camping out there, you know, a lot of time there. I think I was there about four, five days or something like that, but, uh ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: Oh, so this was new, this was right after you ... It was early on.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Just when we got there.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Okay. Yeah, interesting.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: And so that's, that's when I found that LIFE Magazine [00:10:00] article that was sort of a takeoff of what Atlantic Monthly had had some months earlier, uh, that was Vannevar Bush and his Memex description.</div><br><div>John Markoff: And this was a machine that was ... There weren't really computers at this point. But this was a machine that was an information retrieval machine?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah. He ... A microfiche, uh, just a small size, uh, hunk of film that you can move and view and stuff and each one of them has center frames on it, etc. So he said what each one should do is sort of have what would be the equivalent of a link today is, you know, it's referring to some other one of those fiche and they'd like to have a mechanical thing that could go get it for you from the list. (clears throat) And it was never built, but that seemed intriguing. But that didn't surface for me ... Let's see. That was 1945.</div><br><div>John Markoff: It was five years later. I thought ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: It was 15 years later.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Oh, it was 15? Okay, we'll, we'll come to that. You also mentioned ... So, um, the idea of, the idea of hypertext. You stumbled across the idea of links and the abili- ... the ability to, to the ... But you also ... I also remember you found a magazine article, and I don't remember the details, but it was about sort of making something with your life.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: How to make the most of your life.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Yes. What was that article? That was ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Oh, that was a book.</div><br><div>John Markoff: A book. Tell me a little. I mean but it had an impression on you.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Oh yeah. That's, uh, I've never heard about, you know, trying to talk about how you can plan and etc. And, uh, you know, just totally the ... There was no professional discussions that I heard at all among my neighbors or anybody about planning careers, etc. And, uh, especially during the Depression when jobs are scarce. Most people were just happy to have steady jobs. And, uh, so I didn't [00:12:00] have any great thinking about that, but I found this book in the library in the ... where I was stationed in Manila for the year, and, uh, so the library there too was almost never anybody else in it (laughs), so I probed a lot.</div><br><div>\tSo that was one of the books I found, and it was, it was just one of the cheery kind of things about advice of how to tune your life and think positive and try for things, etc. But it somehow impressed me so much that, uh, it led me astray. I stole the book when I left. (laughs) But I didn't feel very guilty because almost no one was ever in the library. (laughs) And, uh ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: You, you came back to the West Coast and you finished your college degree in, in Oregon.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Right.</div><br><div>John Markoff: But now, when you went to Berkeley, did ... No? You ... Oh, that's right. You ... Before you went to Berkeley, you came to California?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah. I, uh, I just happened to take a job offer down here in the Silicon ... San Francisco area at the Ames Aeronautical Laboratory. And, uh, you know, various people had come from different companies, etc. to give talks and, and try to, uh, enlist graduating, graduating students. And so I had been signed up to go to General Electric back East, and then this fellow came from the Ames Laboratory here to talk about what could be done there, and, uh, then I remember how much fun it was in the San Francisco area because my last seven months of training were on the Navy, with the Navy owned Treasure Island at the time. And, um, so I thought, \u201cGee. That's fun. That's right near Stanford girls.\u201d (laughs) So, uh, for some reason, I signed up to come down here.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Now when you went to work, um, at Ames, [00:14:00] um, you ended up supporting the wind tunnels. Is that right?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah. Um, I thought I was coming to work in the instrumentation development group, but I got sort of waylaid as I first came in. See, the Greyhound bus I was on stopped at the stoplight (laughs) at Moffett Boulevard and 101. (laughs) I'm laughing now because it was not a freeway, so I trundled up there. And, uh, so it wasn't long before this talking guy came and, and, uh, intercepted and, and talked, talked me into, \u201cOh, it's much more interesting in this other group. You know, we take care of the wind tunnels and all that.\u201d Well, it was an education. Uh, so I was there three years before I got my ... whatever it is.</div><br><div>John Markoff: The ... Oh, I see. So before you decided that you needed to, to move on and ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Before I got the, the big turn on, uh ... I don't know. What, what do you call it? Just ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: A vision, in- ... insight, uh ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Well, the sequence of them. First, first soon after I got engaged, I suddenly realized I didn't have any goals professionally. Here are all these interesting goals about getting married and a family. And, uh, uh, so the day I realized that was the Monday after I got engaged, driving to work. Oh, I better get goals that worked. And for some reason, what flashed in my head that just changed my life forever was, \u201cOh, goal. Hey, that's interesting. I've never thought about having a, a real goal professionally.\u201d And that's how naive country boy. And so another na\u00efve country boy's thing that what came up when I said, \u201cOh, that sounds good. Let's grab that as a goal.\u201d</div><br><div>\tAnd the goal, I, I ... Just was welded in my mind because it says, \u201cHey, why don't I pick a goal that will maximize the benefits my career will have to mankind?\u201d [00:16:00] Just your 25-year-old country boy, I don't know where it came from but it was just so clear and, uh ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: You were still at Ames at this point.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Okay. [crosstalk 00:16:12] You were driving to work and ... Were you ... You weren't living in Atherton by that time. Where did you live at ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Oh, I, I was renting a room in, in Los Altos.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Okay. You were engaged, but you, you guys weren't married yet.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Oh, I've been engaged for two days. (laughs)</div><br><div>John Markoff: (laughs) Okay. I want to go backwards for a second because there's, there's something I wanted to, to ask you about in terms of the way your thinking evolved. Um, you told me about, um, uh, your experience in the wind tunnel or seeing how they developed stuff in the wind tunnel. And you, you basically came in contact with the idea of scaling, and there was a word you, you used that it was used in terms ... And I had forgotten the word about they were interested in scaling down ... They were interested in scaling up. Um, and there was a word that described that, an engineering term. Do you, do you remember?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Well, the, the dimensional analysis, they call it, and scaling and then there are some ... You can put together different factors, you know, how many feet per second you go and how many second for this or that. And if you juggle them so that this array of terms, all the dimensions cancel out, they call it dimensional, dimensionless number. And it just turns out in a funny way that, uh, if any other thing you make has the same, you know ... That that dimensionless number changes, that's what's going to give you in that scaling. But, but, um, it just, it just came into my mind of you can test this little piece of a wind foil, air foil and a wind tunnel and translate that accurately to what it'll mean in the big wind tunnel which just changes, so.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Yeah. Okay, I'll come back to it, but I realize I interrupted you because you had a series of insights. One was that you needed a goal, [00:18:00] but there was another one.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah, the goal about (a) how, how does, how does your maximum ... How can you maximize the benefit your career will have to mankind? Which, uh, you know, how do these ... Not just as, as, a real sign of how na\u00efve country boy, things I've never quite gotten over (laughs), but, uh, uh, oh, well, what, what are some of the really big challenges mankind has that if you can really help that, you've really contributed.</div><br><div>\tAnd this got me into starting and looking in the library and things about big, tough, complex goals and such, you know, like, hey, the, the, uh, malaria problems in some tropical areas where you've got all places where everybody is so beat down by having malaria all the time. Oh, you could drain the swamps. Oh yes, but how do you get the money to do that? How do you coordinate it? Well, then if you drain the swamps, I realized one day the, you know, that, uh, they stopped being sick all the time. Well, the population will probably grow faster and exceed them ... sustenance capability of the land.</div><br><div>\tAnd, you know, it's just not simple, and that's what just dawned on me one Saturday, all these problems are very big. Oh, and they have to be dealt with collectively, and we're not getting smarter collectively enough to handle these big things. Oh, (clears throat). Oh, maybe ... Oh, and then suddenly, the idea of a computer and the electronics that I had learned with radar and sonar of screens, how electronics can make things draw on the screen, and in fact how the electronics in a radar can respond to the use ... the operator.</div><br><div>\tOh, well, if a computer, all they knew about it is they can punch cards or print on paper, well, then, certainly I just knew instinctively you can make electronics to put anything you want on a screen. And if they can [00:20:00] read punched cards, they can certainly read what a human does and it just, you know, I just knew instinctively that you could make it so you could interact with one, and somehow that just came to a picture of, boy, that's what I could go after.</div><br><div>John Markoff: And did you frame it with the idea of augmentation at that point? That, that ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: No, it took, it took years to, uh ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: So the idea was there, but to actually get the structure.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Well, it was going to augment. It was going to be able to do these things and like, oh, and the same computer complex, you could tie a number of these, uh, dem- ... workstations together and you could collaborate, and, uh, oh boy, let's just go. And then, then I realized it would be handy to have some research, you know, talents or training. And, well, I should go to graduate school, and, uh, the Berkeley had a research project that they were building an experimental computer, uh ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: But it was, it was ... You already had the idea of the system you want to build and so you needed skills and that you knew that they were working on a computer project and that was ... became the place to go to ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah. That plus how do you do research? You know, the whole thing about equipping yourself to be able to be qualified to do the kind of research.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Um, you ... Tell me about meeting Ballard. Um, your ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: She was a girl that (laughs) ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: But you ... I remember, uh, you told me at one point that when you were at Ames, a lot of times, you would just go over and hang out at the library at Stanford. You weren't a real social guy. Um, probably the stacks at Stanford libraries were not the best place to meet young women.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah. Well, I, I was ... Got to thinking I'd like to meet women. I, I, I had an interest in, uh, soaring, soaring planes. So I started going with a group and meeting with [00:22:00] them that were learning how to do that. And then one day, I suddenly realized there's nothing but men in here. (laughs) So then I, I asked the guys at, at work, well, where do you go to meet girls? Well, see, they were ... Most of them are married. They didn't have all that many ideas, except one of them mentioned that well, he, here's that ... In the Palo Alto City Center, they have, uh, folk dancing classes. Oh, and I just pictured something that turned off, so.</div><br><div>\tBut anyway, I went over there one evening and stood there and watched an intermediate class and it just intrigued the hell ... I, I was very clumsy and bashful and I, I couldn't do ballroom dancing effectively with just a [serial 00:22:44] sweat. But I watched what all these people were doing. Oh, boy. And so even though they were in an intermediate class, at the next break, I scooted out there and grabbed a woman who was started ... Well, I, I had never done anything like that (laughs). So I began to be a regular at that, and, and, uh, that's where I met Ballard and [crosstalk 00:23:05].</div><br><div>John Markoff: That's right. So you, you moved to Berkeley. Um, you got a PhD in electrical engineering?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Okay. But it was basically, um, the design and, and research leading to com- ... computer systems.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: You could take the computer option of doing research and talking about that and, um, and I happen to remember some strange bistable phenomena in gaseous discharges like neon tube or something that you could install ... You put a radio wave, radio wave, cross it like this and, uh, and that's the way we would tune the transmitters. You know, the brighter that light ... You hold that up near the antenna and the ... As you adjust the power level, the brighter it got, the more power out there. Then, I noticed one day that also [00:24:00] as you backed it down, it would stay lit at a lower, uh, voltage level than it took to get it going. Oh, you know, at that intermediate stage if it were lit, it would stay lit. If it weren't, it wouldn't get lit.</div><br><div>\tAnd so I thought, well, that would be an interesting thing in the computer world of another bistable sort of phenomenon. And so I built shift registers of little, little patterns of glow, no-glow, would just shift around that tube. But it's far too clumsy and slow for (laughs).</div><br><div>John Markoff: [crosstalk 00:24:35] Um, and yet it led you to your ... Didn't it lead you to your first sort of business venture?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah.</div><br><div>John Markoff: So you, you were an entrepreneur. That was sort of a sidetrack but yet, you, you wanted to do something with the technology. Was that ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Well, it turned out there were some fast-talking patent attorney that I happened to bump in when I was at school or like that and said, \u201cHey, you could get these things patented.\u201d So 13 or 14 patents came out of this. You know, you can almost build a whole computer with these little gaseous plasma things. Um, but it, it just ... You know, then there was the chance. He said, \u201cYou know, you could actually start a business and have this goal. And one thing you could do is make very interesting kind of signs for people because they could have these neon tubes around like that and the little glow-no patterns would move around them so you could have just very interesting things.\u201d So, okay, but I was ... I, I wasn't destined to be a businessman or something, so the [packers 00:25:44] we had pulled out after about four, five months, and ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: Yeah. There were some San Francisco store owners, weren't they, who ultimately invested in the project? Wasn't it one of the retail stores in San Francisco? The, the family?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah. I can't remember now.</div><br><div>John Markoff: But it, [00:26:00] it went nowhere. When it didn't work out, what did you decide to do next?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Oh, then I, then I decided I really liked to get in just doing some real research and get going after the computer things I wanted. And so, uh, um, I had, I had been doing this while I was still teaching. I was an acting assistant professor at Berkeley after I got my degree for two years and, um, so something that happened in that environment too was very telling. Um, because Ballard and I continued folk dancing and, and we're getting acquainted with university people, and one time there was a party one Saturday that, uh, one of the guys, friends of ours, he was an as- ... an associate professor in economics or something, but just very nice people.</div><br><div>\tSo after the party, I was helping him clean up and he happened to say, \u201cWell, what's your special interest, Doug?\u201d You know, because if you're in that university position, this is what you have to be doing, and I started telling him and he slowed down his work and finally looked at me and says, \u201cWell, um, you are aware, aren't you, of how promotion is handled in universities?\u201d Na\u00efve country kid shines through again and says, \u201cWell, um, no, not really.\u201d (laughs) Uh, so he explains to me about peer review and that you get promoted by writing papers that get submitted and accepted in the best journals. And the peer review decides, you know, your peers review it and that decides what gets in. He says, \u201cSo I can tell you right now. If you keep talking like you are now, you'll be an acting assistant professor forever.\u201d</div><br><div>John Markoff: (laughs)</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: And, uh, I, I just really ... Suddenly, I got it. But the funny thing is then I thought ... [00:28:00] We thought of coming down the univers- ... Uh, Peninsula to get some jobs. Well, there was no Silicon Valley, but there was a Hewlett-Packard, and, uh, we had used their test equipment in the, in the Navy, so I knew about their story. So I went there and, oh, these interesting things I had done for my thesis work intrigued them and such. So, boy, he offered me a job in the research and, uh ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: Now, you, you met with both Hewlett and Packard. It was a small enough group that it was, it was David Packard who offered you the job, wasn't it?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: No, the, the head of research.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Oh, that's right. Um ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Barney Oliver.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Barney Oliver. But at some point, you had discussions with Packard.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Yeah. And I remember Packard said ... Didn't Packard tell you, \u201cYou could keep the technology that you\u201d ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: This ... What just happened, he was such a straightforward guy. I just happened to say, \u201cWell, I've got this problem. There are quite a few different IT inventions I've had for my thesis work that I haven't patented yet and ... But I know when I go to work for you, I've got to sign over all the patents. So what do I do about that?\u201d He came out just instantly with thing, \u201cWell, I'll tell you. How about this? For the first six months, everything you can write disclosures on will be yours, no matter whether you thought of them at our place or before. After six months, they'll be ours, whether you thought about them before or after.\u201d And that just impressed me so much, just the honest, straightforward kind of way to do it. I just never forgot that, and, uh ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: So they offered you a job.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Uh, and you didn't take it.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah, because ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: Tell me. Tell me what happened.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Well, I was driving home then all excited and by the time I got up here by Redwood City or something, I thought, \u201cOh. Wait a minute.\u201d And I stopped and called Barney Oliver up and I said, \u201cOh. Um, I forgot to check on something that I'm totally committed to working with computers and so I'm assuming you guys will get to be working with them soon, so I just wanted to check on that.\u201d And so it's just [00:30:00] maybe a check. And he said, \u201cOh, sorry, Doug. Not a chance.\u201d And, uh, so I said, \u201cOkay. I guess that closes off our deal.\u201d</div><br><div>John Markoff: Yeah. What was the next step? So you, you were still looking ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: [crosstalk 00:30:14] I tried Stanford and wrote them a letter telling how I could ... I knew how to, uh, conduct laboratory and some classes and basic digital technique and learning and such. And, uh, the dean of engineering who was a very good guy and such wrote back a letter saying, \u201cWell, thank you for your interest in Stanford, but I must say we're a very small university and we have to specialize in highly academic topics, etc. for our research world. And, uh, since computers are only a service activity, we don't contemplate ever having computer classes and design classes or whatever.\u201d And, uh ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: Do you remember if that was Terman or Linvill? Do either of those names ring a bell?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Oh, sure. Uh, they both ring a bell, but that wasn't ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: Either?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Uh ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: Okay. So, so Stanford wasn't going to be a computer, um, research organization any time soon.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Either. Yeah, like, like Berkeley.</div><br><div>John Markoff: So where did you turn next?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: So then I went to Stanford Research Institute which later changed its name to SRI International. And they, they had the job at that time of actually developing a computer for the Bank of America's use, and, um ... But it was ... So that sound promising, but, uh, again, this time, uh, I happen to ... The first one I talked to at SRI was somebody who left Berkeley before I had by a couple of years, and he never found out what my driving interest was, and, uh, so he, he asked me. \u201cWell, I guess I've never found out.\u201d</div><br><div>\tAnd I started telling him that he went, he started looking in shock and he says, \u201cHave you talked to anybody else?\u201d \u201cNo, you're the first one.\u201d \u201cWell, I advise you. Don't just tell them about your [00:32:00] patents and your research and don't talk about that computer stuff because, uh, that'll turn, turn people off. And then you get hired. You get to be here and have a chance sometime to get the support.\u201d</div><br><div>John Markoff: Yeah. So they did offer you a job and it was with which group?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: That wasn't with a group. It was just plunking at a laboratory (clears throat) and sort of like then you scout around to see, uh, who would be interesting ... you know, who would interested and interesting. And, uh, so I, I ... They, they weren't interested in the, in the ... Building the computer for the Bank of America didn't really appeal to me, but, uh, then I met Hugh Crane and his magnetic logic things.</div><br><div>John Markoff: So this was a group funded by the Pentagon. They were hopeful about, uh, the development of magnetic logic technology for whatever reason, military reasons or ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: (coughs) I am not sure who funded them because this was considerably before, uh, what's now the Information Processing Techniques Office got established in ARPA. And, uh ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: Okay. But these could be the building blocks. These could have been the building blocks for computers of the future. That was one of the ideas possibly.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Okay. Yeah.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: But they, they'd be quite slow and, um, so I helped with that and then ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: You developed some, some innovative magnetic, um, devices, right, at, at this group? Um, switches or ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Well, the first thing they're having were just shift registers. You could shift bits down a long chain, you know, whole pattern and, um, and they were multi-aperture devices, uh, a large toroid with small holes, [00:34:00] you know, bump around the small hole in the ... It case it goes around.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Yeah.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: And it turned out that you could put current through there. It would lock, lock out the magnetism that would go around and, and, uh, then if you pulse that hard when the rest of it collapsed, that would make enough of the signal to transmit it to the next one, thing of this sort. And, uh ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: It was while you were working with this group that you went to Philadelphia to, uh, a meeting of, um, the International Circuits Conference. You traveled with Hugh Crane. This must have been 1960 perhaps, to give a paper about the idea of, um, I think it was called similitude. And it was about scaling. It was ... You were putting some ideas together, ideas that you had ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Well, when, when I was going around doing that, I came to SRI in 1957 and, uh, so I was kind of hoping there'd be a chance to get into something with more active computer things. But one day I happened to be talking to a, a program manager, research manager, uh, in the Air Force and, uh, I just happened to tell him about the interest I had gotten about the similitude, this scaling issue about airplanes and that, uh, uh, it'd be very interesting to study that for electronic components too because, you know, if you just make things smaller and smaller, they just naturally get faster.</div><br><div>\tSo I got a grant to do that, so, uh, then I, I did enough in that to kind of find much better ways to explain it and, um, why a device that this size would probably stop working if you make it 1/10th the size. [00:36:00] And, um, that's generally because some of the phenomena that you're harnessing in there are affected directly by the linear measure of something. Others are affected by the area and others by the volume. Of course all those change, they, they don't change at the same way as it's changed the scale. And so, uh, a phenomena that worked together this size would stop being able to latch together in this, but new phenomena could be found.<br>\tAnd, um, so I just thought, \u201cOh, that's terrific because knowing that, that, uh, the, the speed increases as well as the density of the things like that. So boy,\u201d I just said, \u201cThat, that's extremely important for the computer world because if we're talking about things I'm hoping for, it's got to be able to get faster and more, more powerful computers.\u201d</div><br><div>John Markoff: So you had proved to yourself that there was going to be enough computing power to build the kind of machine that you wanted to build.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: It just seemed inevitable right now.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Yeah. So you stumbled across the thing that would become known in 1965 or much later but you, you stumbled across Moore's Law or the, the, the scaling process.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Well, yeah, not the law about how much it's going to change, but yeah.</div><br><div>John Markoff: The, the underlying phenomenon that would be codified by the industry. Um, so who at SRI sort of, uh ... Did you ... You bumped into who let you begin to work on building a machine to augment human intelligence? Who? Wa- ... Was it outside or was it inside SRI that you got the ori- ... the original support?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Oh, outside. (laughs)</div><br><div>John Markoff: Okay. But Charlie Rosen was sympathetic to your ideas, wasn't he? I mean he, he was helpful, I, I think, I remember ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Oh yeah. Yeah.</div><br><div>John Markoff: In terms of funding or ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Well, just, just encouragement.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Yeah.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: He couldn't give me any funds or something.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Yeah. It was ... Was it the Air Force first who was your first funder?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah. Um, it was called Air Force Office of Scientific Research, [00:38:00] just, uh, sort of one-man ... or four-person office. Uh, and, uh, it just, it just happened that, uh, he was a wild-eyed enough character that he thought, \u201cWell.\u201d I, I just said, \u201cI, I want to write a study about what's the chances of ... and what's the payoff potential for interactive use of computers? And, uh, so he, he gave me some money to do this study, enough so I could just start sitting down and, and working and, uh ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: No computer though. You were, you were working entirely with ideas.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Oh, there was ... Weren't computers available. That's ... Um, anytime. Anyway, so I was just stubborn enough that that's what I'm going to do and even when the ... that kind of money didn't quite reach what it would take to support me fulltime, the institute had what they called the internal R&D where they would use overhead money to sponsor something that would hope to develop into a prog- ... funded program. And, um, so I kept plugging away and, uh ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: You wrote some papers.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah. And, uh, and, um, I wrote one about scaling before that on that other one. Uh, and so I ended up with this one sizeable report after about a year and a half or more. So in the fall of 1962, there was a quite large report. It was called Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework. And, uh, just hundreds and hundreds of hours of painful, trying to get ... carrying it through and such, [00:40:00] but, uh, out of that came a real, a real difference from the people whose terminology was oriented about automating our jobs, computer automating. And, uh, I said, \u201cWell, gee. It's more than that. It can change the way you work and think.\u201d</div><br><div>\tAnd so I pulled up this term, augmentation, and, uh, realizing how much else changes besides the artifacts we bring in. And, uh, I tried to explain to people. \u201cWell, do you think that, uh, elevators just automated everybody's ability to get up to the top floor, seventh or eighth floor and that was all?\u201d No. Look what happened (clears throat). Buildings ... whew ... way up and then air-conditioning had to change, and, oh, population density or office business density. Well, that changes, you know, the commuting in and out had to change. Just huge amount of changes. And, uh ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: The ideas were there. Who gave you the money to actually begin to implement them with a computer?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Uh, the first, a guy who's now a historic figure, uh, he was, uh, an engineering-oriented guy from the MIT area and, uh, MIT and Harvard. And he had written a book called Man-Computer Symbiosis, a, a paper.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Uh-huh (affirmative).</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: And, uh, so he was trying and ARPA brought him down to help set up the first Information Processing Techniques Office, so he set that up. And I was right there with proposals, so he ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: This was J.C.R. Licklider.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Right.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Yeah. And, uh, that allowed you to acquire an early small CDC machine. Was that your first?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: No. There were, [00:42:00] there were a sequence of different machines, but that one had a very small one, uh, but it turned out that, uh, you know, you know, even when I talked about paradigm, I haven't yet, but the paradigms that made it hard for me to stay in university because who, who's going to work with computers interactively and so on like this? So the paradigm thing was just so prevalent and really impeded me immensely for decades.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Did you know at that time that you needed to break out of paradigms to begin thinking of new ideas?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Oh yeah.</div><br><div>John Markoff: So that was part of the, the, this research struggle right from the start.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah. When doing that long study about augmenting human intellect, this, this came out quite clearly and, uh, and I found a book that described the name of what paradigms were, etc. I can't remember the author. I'm sorry.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Yeah.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: It was very important. And, um ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: This wasn't The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. That came later, didn't it? That hadn't been written but when you were ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Uh, so anyway, the, the paradigms that's sort of like this paper about augmenting human intellect just seems so outlandish or out of this world to the administrators at SRI that, uh, when the first money came to me to do that, they, uh, politely told me that they'd promote me to be a senior research engineer and said I ought to write more things like this, and they put John in charge of the project because he was a computer programmer and knew how to do things like ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: John was one of the first people who worked for you or ... Who's ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: No. It, it ... [00:44:00] I, I was moved aside and if I ever tried to talk to them, I would get scolded. \u201cLeave them alone. John knows what he's doing.\u201d I would just ... It was just a, a parody on ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: So how did you get out of that?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Well, that went (laughs) and Licklider came to, to visit. I was, I was so na\u00efve I didn't think of complaining to him or something about what happened. Uh, and I ... You know, for years, I still am too na\u00efve about the politics of all sorts of organizational environments and, uh.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Did Licklider introduce Taylor to you or did Taylor find his way to you in ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: I found Taylor. He was working for NASA.</div><br><div>John Markoff: That's right.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: And then told him about ARPA and Licklider and, uh, so then he went over there later but, uh ... Anyway, when Lick found out, you know, he sort of closed down that, that project and it wasn't until another time, it was too small a computer that we had to ... It was ... We are like the client that would work with a time-sharing computer which was under development down in Southern California (laughs).</div><br><div>John Markoff: But this was ... You had ... That was where you started the online system. Uh, you were doing the original development down in ... The programming was being done down in Southern California because that's where the computer was.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Well, we could program and [crosstalk 00:45:31] like that. But, but that thing just ... That computer was never work- ... would ... was always crashing (laughs), so that one didn't work. And, uh, then we got, uh, then we got a, another one that was big enough to start doing it, and that's the one where we put the display on it and, uh, I got the money to do a research project on trying to test the different kind of display selection devices, [00:46:00] and that's when I came up with the idea of the mouse, which got added into the other devices we were testing.</div><br><div>John Markoff: And this was \u201863, \u201864?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah, late \u201862 and \u201863.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Yeah. So it was ... What drove you to the mouse was how to interact with the display.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah. It was just while we were getting the different devices and then I happen to remember sketching up some ideas like that that was the first mouse and, and, uh, Bill English was setting up the engineering for this. And we had to make our own computer display. You couldn't buy them and, uh, I think it cost us $90,000 in 1963 money.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Did the technology come from the radar world? Where did you get the components to build it?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Well, people had been talking about doing that, so we just had to build it from scratch.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Yeah.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Uh, and the way it, way it was, is it would move, move the curs- ... move, move the beam and write the characters. It wasn't nearly enough storage capacity to have pixel.</div><br><div>John Markoff: So you built ... And you had at that point, were you developing your own character generators as well?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah.</div><br><div>John Markoff: That was the architecture.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: The writing of that. So that took a, a hunk of electronics that was about, you know, a table this size and about six feet by four feet ... or three feet by four feet full of electronics that was a display driver (laughs). And, uh, so then the computer display, it looked pretty good.</div><br><div>John Markoff: And I've seen the pictures. It wasn't square. Your first display I believe was a, wasn't it a round screen? Didn't you ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Oh, oh, sure.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Yeah, because they weren't square screens.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Right.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Yeah. (laughs) You told me once that ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: But anyway, that's what we then had available to use ...</div><br><div>Speaker 3:\tHang on a second, guys. One second.</div><br><div>Speaker 4:\t[00:48:00] Uh, Doug, you're playing with the microphone again.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Oh.</div><br><div>Speaker 4:\t[crosstalk 00:48:05] The cord.</div><br><div>Speaker 3:\tJust be careful at the top.</div><br><div>Speaker 4:\tYeah, just be, just be careful. It, it was thumping into the audio, so. (laughs)</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: (laughs)</div><br><div>John Markoff: Okay. Shall we start again?</div><br><div>Speaker 3:\tYeah.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Is this too much detail?</div><br><div>John Markoff: No, this is great. This is, this is ... I want to get all the detail I can. So don't worry. I'll, I'll ... Um, you told me once about the, the, sort of the thought process that you led directly to the mouse. You were at a meeting, and I think you said you were a little bored and so you were just sort of daydreaming?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: That's the second stage. The first stage was years before when I was a senior in college and, uh, uh, I took the power option instead of the electronic option because I had a lot of electronics (laughs). And so we were doing these tests on big, heavy generators and everything like this, and, uh, then you have to plot the data and then there's some point in there in which the data plot makes a closed loop and you have to figure out what the area under is. So there's a device that you get that's ... It planks down solid and it's an elbow like thing with a pointer at the end. And, uh, a little round sharp-edge wheel like that and another one at the elbow. And when you go around this thing, the change in how much those wheels turn, uh, you can use those to calculate what the area of ... No matter what the, the shape was.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Right.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: And I asked the, the, the instructor, \u201cWell, how does that work?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, all I know is that those wheels like that, if you had access like that, they'll only roll along this direction no matter what. If they do like this, they'll only roll as far as you went in that direction.\u201d And, uh, so it was during some kind of a conference in which I was bored that I thought of that and got my little notebook and says, oh, you know, if you put two of them together like this, one would be telling you how far this way and the other this way. And that's all ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: To capture the movement of the XY axis. [00:50:00] So you just compressed that into a box basically, and that's the computer mouse.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Right.</div><br><div>John Markoff: That's great. So ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: So Bill, I told him to sketch that for him and he built the first one.</div><br><div>John Markoff: You went to the machine shop and they built a, a wooden box.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Oh, no, this was ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: Even before?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: It got ... Well, it, uh, you design it so somebody has to do mechanical design drawings to tell a machine shop what to do. So there's a mechanical draftsman kid that was doing that. And, uh, he happened to say, \u201cOh, I'm a, a, I'm a ... My hobby is wood, wood carving. I can make a case over it.\u201d So that's how that got there. And, uh, all we were doing is testing the select so one button, red, and we didn't think about it but the cord came out this tail end so sitting there. And somebody ... And we still don't know who among the five or six people involved in designing and building and setting up the experiments, etc. and tests and training the subjects and so on, somebody in there started calling it a mouse because I don't think about giving names to things like that. And, uh ... But, uh, so this is ... So no one, no one knows. So it's ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: Lost in history.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah, lost in history.</div><br><div>John Markoff: And, um, the first one had one button, the very first one you built. But what, what was the right number of buttons? Did, did you think about how many buttons you wanted after you built the first one?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah, right.</div><br><div>John Markoff: And what, what was your thought process?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Well, all we could get on. I could only get three in there the way it was designed, so that's (laughs).</div><br><div>John Markoff: More would have been better if you could've ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Yeah.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Because, uh, I don't know how Steve Jobs says one button or something like that, but you've got lots of action here that you can do, and, uh, that ... It just seems silly of me not to use that.</div><br><div>John Markoff: So if you could be more [00:52:00] powerful, if you could have more power in the hand, that would be, that would be ideal.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Well, this is, this sort of ... And it gets into that paradigm situation again of, of, you know, what's easy to learn? See? Versus what are you capable of doing? And you could learn. When you learn, it'll be easy. And if, if you just realize how many things you do that, that when you're born aren't conditioned into that ... You know, just all kinds of skills that ... Take for granted.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Yeah.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: And, well, typing ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: Yeah.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: ... and things. So, so I would just saying, sure, this opens up the interface at something in which we're exploring capability and, uh, let's go after capability. And this, I was just sure that every knowledge worker in the future was going to be working this way. And, uh, well, we can talk about that.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Well, but you ... There are a whole bunch of little pieces here, big pieces. Um, another device you developed was a chord key, keyboard. Um, it turned out not to be a success in terms of acceptance in the bigger market but it was a way that you were experimenting with breaking down paradigms.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Well, it's just a way to improve capability because if you're using the mouse, you can't type and, uh, so that leads to the thing of all the point and click, uh, uh, uh. And to me, that was like pigeon English, you know, uh, ooh. And, uh, so the actually command language we developed was just saying I wanted the ... We've got a bunch of verbs. You want actions you want to do on a bunch of different kind of objects, what then ... designated by nouns.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Right.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: So we, we had that and then with the absolute minimum number of keystrokes to set up any command, like just D-W [00:54:00] would flash up delete word. So you hit D-W, click, click, the word is gone. C-W, I want to copy the word. Click, click, it gets copied. Replace the word ... or a whole paragraph, a sentence, just all kinds of things. Visible string just meant, you know, it would be a word plus any punctuation or something. So we ended up with many verbs and many nouns that, uh, if somebody came and looked at that, oh. But it's just like you're learning an extension to your natural language if you come in to some new kind of environment. Uh ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: By this time, you had begun to build the online system.</div><br><div>Speaker 3:\tOne second. We need to change [production talk 00:54:46].</div><br><div>John Markoff: Sure. Got you.</div><br><div>Speaker 3:\tGood. [production talk 00:54:50]</div><br><div>John Markoff: Yeah.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: That's a par- ... paradigm issues we had ... I, I, um ... Somebody. Let's see. About the time where, where you did your mouse thing at Xerox PARC and that, uh, I was at the history museum for some reception they had. And I met a guy who worked at the, at National Science Foundation. And I didn't know him. I just got to talking and found out he did. And, uh, so I said, \u201cWell, I wonder. You know, I'm not in university and I'm pretty old.\u201d</div><br><div>Speaker 3:\t[production talk 00:55:43]</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: I got to talking with him. So, uh, he called me up later and invited me to come at the end of the month to talk to the staff at NSF.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Did you do that recently?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Just the end of this month.</div><br><div>John Markoff: [00:56:00] Oh, you just, you just went?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: No.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Oh, you're just going?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: No. You know, at the end of August.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Oh, okay. Oh, great. Well, that's good.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah. So it's just like, hey, [crosstalk 00:56:07].</div><br><div>John Markoff: Excellent.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: And so a big thing I want to get to them, a lot of examples of the paradigm issue.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Yeah. So, um, where did the idea of bootstrapping come from? As part of the augment system, the idea of being able to, to sort of build the system and then build on top of the system and then continue that process. Where did that idea come from?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: It, it came out of the ... Two things, that the model of how we augment ourselves. We already are augmented, and it's a huge amount of things more than just the artifacts we employ, all the skills and the methods and the language and customs and the organizational structures and all, all kinds of things that are like this that they all ... The artifacts are just integrated in. And there's no way you're going to make some huge change in the capability of an organization by just plugging in some new line of art- ... artifacts. And so that, that just got to the point of saying, oh, the only way you're going to do it is by helping facilitate the evolution of that whole thing.</div><br><div>John Markoff: And was that approach sort of, uh, in process in the first half of the \u201860s as you sort of ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: That's ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: It was clear in your mind that that's the way you would evolve the system.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Right. And then, then in the early \u201870, what I need ... You need to get real people, not just the research kind of guy, the real people involved. So we set up an arrangement and DARPA let us ... ARPA let us go ahead and, uh, start selling NLS usage as service over the ARPANET.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Right.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: And, uh, this was going out great. We actually had the way to, to cultivate their usage and start helping facilitate their evolution, and what they need [00:58:00] is the way it changes the tools, etc. and ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: But before you did that, you built this system. You had a display, a computing device, a storage device, a sophisticated software system that allowed you to do, uh, text editing and hypertext. You had all of the ingredients of modern personal computing. Um, you showed it to the world for the first time really in 1969.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: \u201868.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Was it December of \u201868?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah.</div><br><div>John Markoff: It was, it was at Brooks Hall in San Francisco. It probably is the most famous computer demonstration in history. How did it happen? What led to the demonstration?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Well, it's, uh, this, our NLS system was getting more and more interesting and useful, and, uh, it just occurred to me it still is very hard to tell any of the colleagues out in the world that we're computer-oriented people what we were doing and why. And so it'll be great instead of just giving a paper at a conference is to demo it. And we had the kind of tech- ... technology on hand that could do that. Uh, because I, I found out that the telephone company was actually in the business that they would lease, set up and lease for you video line links. So we had two, two links, one-way links going from San ... from SRI up to the city. And, uh, then we had to build a modem ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: To carry the data.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: To ... So that we could run it from the city. And you couldn't buy a modem, so Bill English and Jeff Rulifson put together a modem. And, uh, uh, then Bill English had happened to ... have been very active, he and his wife, in amateur theater and so he knew how you had to direct and run things. And, uh, so he, he not only arranged for the communication up there [01:00:00] and all this, but then he built a, uh, a platform about this high, uh, that was covered with canvass where he sat there with the two feeds coming up like this, but also then the feed that would go up to the projector and ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: The projector was just a remarkable device. I mean it was ... The screen was huge by, by ... The only way they can make screens in those days of that size was with film, but you were doing video projection.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Well, we just happened to stumble some months before that because we never could have done it without that and something ... I think it was called an Eidophor.</div><br><div>John Markoff: An Eidophor projector.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Right. And it ... The phenomena by which it made ... That modified the light, it sort of had a mirror that was coated ... A mirror surface was thin film of mercury, and it was in a vacuum, and the electron beam could go there like this. It turns out that that charged density on the surface of the mercury would deform it a little bit like this, and that was all it took to bend the light as it come down and it would then go through a grading so that which was bent would be darker at that point and stuff like this. But it was just a magic thing. It was something by six-foot high and three by two feet or something like this, on wheels.</div><br><div>John Markoff: With an arc light as its light source, right? That really bright arc light source.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Yeah.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: So, uh ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: So you sat up on stage. You had the keyboard, the chord key set.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: And the mouse in it. And, uh, it was all on a kind of molded, uh, thing fit on a chair with a swivel that it turned out that Herman Miller furniture company, uh, the designer there got really interested in what we did, so they built those chairs for us. (laughs)</div><br><div>John Markoff: You know, I talked to them about it about two months ago. They're still very proud of the fact that they helped you.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Oh, really?</div><br><div>John Markoff: Yes. And they have pictures. I should send you the picture. I have a [01:02:00] picture of you consulting with a Herman Miller person about the design of ... That they still have in their archives.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Oh, that's terrific.</div><br><div>John Markoff: I'll send it to you. But anyway.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Oh yeah, that was, that was really something. So, uh, anyway, then, then Bill English also had an audio line going back down to the peninsula and, uh, and he'd be telling people ... I wrote the script, script for it all and that, and that included people from the lab tying in and doing things, and Bill was ... Then, we had volunteer people with ... We borrowed the video cameras that made the (laughs) ... Generated the displays for our people (laughs). They were very great fix-up, but, uh, the ... So it was just so much leverage temporary put together things that it could have crumbled during the time.</div><br><div>John Markoff: You had an audience of about a thousand.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: I don't know literally how many.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Some of the best computer scientists in the country. People before that didn't think of computing as interactive, and you showed them ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Well, if they did, they, they had a very different idea from what I had done. And, uh ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: This was really the first public demonstration of the kind of interactive computing that we all take for granted now.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah. And, and more that we're doing things there that just totally got cut away because they didn't have paradigms.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Yeah.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: You know, while we had hyperlinks going but hyperlinks, all kinds of ... between everything and everything. You could link to anything.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Yeah.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: And the hyperlinks that we ... Now also all kind of optional viewing. So one thing is wide view and I clip paragraphs so I only show the first three lines for instance. And so on the next line would be the, the long, ugly link kind of thing. You wouldn't see that. So if you said jump the link, the system would go looking [01:04:00] downstream for the link and take it. So that's how we changed. Almost every scene was just jumping on links around inside that and with different views, and we had graphics working at the time, you know, can make that map for instance of, you know, how I'm going to get home this evening (laughs) after all the shopping for my wife. And, uh, so ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: What do you remember about the, uh, the audience reaction when you finished your demonstration?</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Well, uh, during the demo, the lights in my eyes were so bright I couldn't see the audience. I just had to know they're there. And so when all got done, I, phew, boy. So I was unstrapping myself and getting up and the lights went out and I saw everybody was standing up, applauding wildly, and I thought, oh, phew, just feeling so lucky that we got through without crashing.</div><br><div>John Markoff: (laughs)</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: And, uh ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: That's neat.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: But, but it was a strange thing. There was a lot of excitement, and the next day, you know, we had the stuff on another room and people could come and see and we could show them ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: Yeah.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: ... the live demos. But, uh, it's just like, oh, all that excitement. After that, it's just like nothing happened in the world.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Well, let's, let's, let's talk about that a little bit, because, you know, in a way, let's talk about the future and sort of what got lost and what still needs to be done. Um, so there were some ideas that got taken away and they turned into commercial products, whole industries, but I think I've come to understand your feeling is that something didn't get taken away.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Oh, boy.</div><br><div>John Markoff: And tell me about what still needs to be done.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Well, I think the focus needs to be on capabilities that you can derive and take the business of, uh, cost of learning and set it aside until you assess the values [01:06:00] of the higher capabilities you can go after. Whereas it, it seemed like there was some level like this, I don't know how it got set that early \u201870s, just got to be easy to learn, and, uh, with all due respect to all the human computer interface guys, that just to me has just been a deno- ... Uh, I point out to people. Hey, we'd all be still be riding tricycles if that's ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: [crosstalk 01:06:22] big adult guy in a tricycle or your other interesting way of getting this idea is about taking a pencil and attaching a brick to it.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah.</div><br><div>John Markoff: And how ineffective it is with the brick on the end of it.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Right.</div><br><div>John Markoff: So your argument is this original idea you had about machines that augment human intelligence, we got trapped on the curve somewhere and it flattened out.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: It was somehow the automation idea got in there and then during the early years, it was office automation; the real user is the secretary. Therefore, you have to make it easy for her to learn, etc. And I kept trying to say, \u201cNo, the real user is tomorrow's knowledge worker.\u201d (laughs) You're a nice guy, Doug, but, uh ...</div><br><div>John Markoff: So how do we get back on the curve? So I understand your principle. Um, you know, somehow we go off the curve. You think we could continue to build more powerful tools that would get us back on this ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Absolutely. And there's a ... A big part of that is, uh, the paradigms about, hey, uh, one, one thing is the \u201cbook,\u201d book paradigm that that's just built into everybody's sort of parad- ... paradigmatic (laughs) outlook is. That's the way you read and study and you say, \u201cWell, no, wait. That's just the way an artifact that they call printing and such produce things that would help you do that.\u201d</div><br><div>John Markoff: Yeah.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: We've got brand-new set of artifacts now, so let's change our paradigms. Let's say what we can do. And so that's what I started doing in the \u201860s. I'd say for one thing, [01:08:00] you don't want to be able to jump around. So not just a link pointing to another document, but I want to, I want to jump, oh, I want to jump ... There were just a huge number of jumps, you could just say what you wanted done. I want to jump to the next chapter. I want to jump back to the rig- ... origin. Oh, then you start saying the different views. You know, one line only. I want this.</div><br><div>\tAnd the optional views just kept growing and growing and the kind of moving around you could do ... get- ... getting more flexible because your jumping and viewing was, well, then, also, since you can address anything so flexibly for a jump, you can also address very flexibly for any editing you want to do. I want to move this chapter to follow this chapter in this other book. That's just one command: Move branch.</div><br><div>John Markoff: So the tools are, the tools are just ... They got stunted somewhere along the way. The, the original model was to have tools that people might ... It might be hard to learn, but once you learn them, you would be so much more powerful.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: That's right. To look at capabilities, see, and so nobody ever did.</div><br><div>John Markoff: Yeah.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: They just, uh, uh, pooh-poohed it. Sort of like in that \u201868 thing, it, it ... A funny thing happened that early this summer, there was a, a European conference, computer-based conference, they called it Reboot, and it was trying to sort of restudy some of the older things that had done. And so for one thing, they got the 90-minute video. We happen to be lucky enough to record that \u201868 demo, and they showed the whole 90 minutes to everybody there. And all of the, the results that they had were just, uh, you know, just raving remarks of like, you know, we're still not able to do a lot of those things.</div><br><div>John Markoff: People are still surprised. Well, one of the things ... I, I, I didn't want to end without noting and asking you what your memories are. [01:10:00] You know, today's internet started with the ARPANET and the ARPANET started with two nodes, and one of them was at ... in Southern California, and the other one was at Menlo Park in the, in the Augment Project. So I think that's important, but what I think nobody knows is that, you know, the, the modern internet is built on these things called ref- ... request for proposals, the whole, the standards effort. And if you go back and you read RFP number one, um, the original ARPANET was built to make the use of NLS, the online system that you designed, uh, remote use of it possible.<br>\t<br>\tSo your NLS system was I, I think the first killer app ... It was supposed to be the first killer app for the ARPANET which became the internet. And do you, do you remember that discussion? What led to them wanting to, to use NLS in that way? Or to ... Was it the idea to make it more ...</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: I don't think it was quite that direct. It was, uh, at the, at the event was a meeting of all the principle investigators ARPA had in the computer domain. I think it was the University of Michigan, I think. And, uh, that when Bob Taylor and Larry Roberts, the two guys running that office, told us all that they were going to go ahead and put together this network on a brand-new mode of doing a network. And, uh, boy, I just right away thinking about the excitement about the collaboration you could do like this, but all they were talking about is sharing resources. If I have special data, you can get access to it. If you have special computer processes, I can send stuff there to get it done actually.<br>\t<br>\tAnd, uh, for me, I looked, hey, this is great, but there was a, an interaction that went on then. Two guys sitting next to me, you know, big shots [01:12:00] and little, small egos, of course, but, um, you know, so one of them turned to the other and says, \u201cWhat do you have in your computer that I could use?\u201d You know, it was, you know ... The other guy, you know, just as quick-witted said, \u201cWell, don't you read my reports?\u201d And this guy gets some ... And he gets back with a killer, \u201cWell, do you send them to me?\u201d Knowing that guy has no idea where his reports go. And they both realized that's never going to get any place, so they turned together to talk to Taylor and Roberts to say, \u201cWell, how are we going to know what's on everybody else's computer?\u201d And it just appeared right then that that hadn't really been thought through.<br>\t<br>\tWell, I had been sitting there, thinking, \u201cHey, that provides a tremendous way for communication and the whole thing.\u201d And so I volunteered to start a Network Information Center there and serve it, and that's, that's sort of why they put me ... my computer on early. And so that, that worked and ran for quite a few years.</div><br><div>John Markoff: And as it turned out, a couple of dec- ... decades later, it changed the world. This has been good. Thank you for the stories.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Oh, but ... (laughs)</div><br><div>John Markoff: We could, we could go on for the rest of the day.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah, right.</div><br><div>John Markoff: There, there are a lot of them. But thanks.</div><br><div>Doug Engelbart: Yeah, that's good.</div>",

Engelbart<br>The Bootstrap Alliance<br>April 23, 2002 (AUGMENT,133320,) </div><br><div>Keynote Address, World Library Summit, April 23 - 26, 2002, Singapore. <br>Republished for the IBM Co-Evolution Symposium September 24, 2003. (biblio-32).<br>Click here for print version (pdf.)<br>Summary. In the past fifty years we have seen enormous growth in computing capability - computing is everywhere and has impacted nearly everything. In this talk, Dr. Douglas Engelbart, who pioneered much of what we now take for granted as interactive computing, examines the forces that have shaped this growth. He argues that our criteria for investment in innovation are, in fact, short-sighted and focused on the wrong things. He proposes, instead, investment in an improvement infrastructure that can result in sustained, radical innovation capable of changing computing and expanding the kinds of problems that we can address through computing. In this talk, Dr. Engelbart describes both the processes that we need to put in place and the capabilities that we must support in order to stimulate this higher rate of innovation. The talk closes with a call to action for this World Library Summit audience, since this is a group that has both a stake in innovation and the ability to shape its direction.</div><br><div>GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS</div><br><div>The development of new computing technologies over the past fifty years - in hardware and software - has provided stunningly important changes in the way we work and in the way we solve problems.</div><br><div>I need to get this assertion out in front of you early in this talk, because most of the rest of what I have to say might cause you to think that I have lost track of this progress or that I don't appreciate it. So, let me get it said \u2013 we have made enormous strides since the early 1950s, when I first began thinking seriously about ways to use computers to address important social problems. It has truly been a remarkable fifty years.</div><br><div>At my first job at NACA, the forerunner of NASA, right out of engineering school, there was no vision at all of electronic computers. In fact the term \"computers\" referred to the room full of women sitting at desks using desk calculators to process the wind tunnel data. This was in the late 40's. After I'd earned my doctorate at UC Berkeley and worked there as an acting assistant professor, I applied to Stanford to help develop and teach computer design courses. They told me \"Since computing is only a service activity, we don't contemplate ever having courses in computer design be part of our academic program.\" When I was pursuing Federal funding for IT projects at SRI in the early 60's, there was some real question about whether there would be the programming talent to work on computing applications of this complexity in Palo Alto California. This certainly inhibited our chances for getting research support.</div><br><div>Later in my research, when I thought about using computers to manipulate symbols and language, rather than to do calculations on numbers, most people thought I was really pretty far gone. I was even advised to stay away from jobs in academia. It seemed clear to everyone else at the time that nobody would ever take seriously the idea of using computers in direct, immediate interaction with people. The idea of interactive computing - well, it seemed simply ludicrous to most sensible people.</div><br><div>So, we have made truly tremendous progress. We are able to solve problems, ranging from weather forecasting to disaster relief to creating new materials to even cracking the very genetic code that makes us humans - problems that we could not have even contemplated without the availability of cheap, widely available, highly functional computers and software. It has been a marvelous 50 years to be in this business.</div><br><div>But that is not what I am going to talk to you about. Not out of lack of appreciation - even a sense of wonder - over what computer technologists have developed - but because I can see that we are not yet really making good progress toward realizing the really substantial payoff that is possible. That payoff will come when we make better use of computers to bring communities of people together and to augment the very human skills that people bring to bear on difficult problems.</div><br><div>In this talk I want to talk to you about that big payoff, think a bit with you about what is getting in the way of our making better progress, and enlist you in an effort to redirect our focus. This audience is made up of the kinds of people who really can change the focus so that we can set at least of part of our development efforts on the right course.</div><br><div>The rewards of focusing on the right course are great. I hope to show you that they can be yours.</div><br><div>THE VISION: THE PAYOFF</div><br><div>Before talking and thinking with you about why we keep heading off in the wrong direction, I need to quickly sketch out what I see as the goal - the way to get the significant payoff from using computers to augment what people can do. This vision of success has not changed much for me over fifty years - it has gotten more precise and detailed - but it is pointed at the same potential that I saw in the early 1950s (ref. 1). It is based on a very simple idea, which is that when problems are really difficult and complex - problems like addressing hunger, containing terrorism, or helping an economy grow more quickly - the solutions come from the insights and capabilities of people working together. So, it is not the computer, working alone, that produces a solution. It is the combination of people, augmented by computers.</div><br><div>The key word here is \"augment.\" The reason I was interested in interactive computing, even before we knew what that might mean, arose from this conviction that we would be able to solve really difficult problems only through using computers to extend the capability of people to collect information, create knowledge, manipulate and share it, and then to put that knowledge to work. Just as the tractor extends the human's ability to work the earth, and planes extend our ability to move, so does the computer extend our ability to process and use knowledge. And that knowledge production is a group activity, not an individual one. Computers most radically and usefully extend our capabilities when they extend our ability to collaborate to solve problems beyond the compass of any single human mind..</div><br><div>I have found, over the years, that this idea of \"augmenting\" capability needs clarification for many people. It is useful to contrast \"augmentation\" with \"automation.\" Automation is what most people have in mind when they think about using computers. Automation is what is going on when we use computers to figure up and print telephone bills or to keep track of bank charges. It is also what is going on when we think about \"artificial intelligence.\" Even though printing up phone bills and AI seem very different, they both share this assumption that the computer stands over there, apart from the human, doing its thing. That is not, in my mind, how we use computers to solve tough problems.  We have the opportunity to harness their unique capabilities to provide us new and more effective ways to use our mind and senses - so that the computer truly becomes a way of extending our capabilities.</div><br><div>The shovel is a tool, and so is a bulldozer. Neither works on its own, \"automating\" the task of digging. But both tools augment our ability to dig. And the one that provides the greatest augmentation, not surprisingly, takes the most training and experience in order to use it really effectively.</div><br><div>For fifty years I have been working to build the computing equivalents of bulldozers. With the added constraint that, in serious knowledge works, it is almost always through the collaborative work of a team, rather than a lone operator, that we make progress.</div><br><div>Now, there is a lot more to say about this vision than that \u2013 and I will speak to some of it later in this talk. But, in starting our consideration of how to change course in order to get a bigger payoff from our investment in computing, this focus on augmenting the ability of groups to solve problems is the right starting point.</div><br><div>EVIDENCE OF TROUBLE</div><br><div>Because we are so accustomed to thinking in terms of the enormous progress and change surrounding computing, it is important to take at least a few moments to look at the evidence that, when it comes to these broader, social and group-centered dimensions of computing, the picture looks quite different.</div><br><div>\"Difficulty in doing important collaborative work. - As one example, my organization, the Bootstrap Alliance, works in loose collaboration with a number of other organizations to help them develop better ways to improve their ability to learn and to use knowledge - in short, we work with organizations to help them improve their ability to improve.<br>One organization that we work with is the Global Disaster Information Network - or \"GDIN\" - which is, itself, a consortium of regional and local disaster response organizations. Organizations that respond to disasters are tremendous examples of organizations that must learn to adapt and use new information quickly. Disasters are, by their nature, unplanned and surprising. Responding requires rapid access to weather information, geographical and mapping information, information about local resources, local communications, the availability of outside resources and organizations - sometimes even about the location of buried mines and unexploded munitions. And, because disaster response involves so many people, from many organizations and jurisdictions, it is critically important to share all of this information about resources and capabilities, as well as information about response status, planned next steps, and so on.</div><br><div>Computers and, in particular, the Internet, clearly play a key role in the efforts to coordinate such disaster response and to improve the ability to improve over the lifecycle of a disaster response effort. But what is striking, as GDIN grapples with these issues, is how difficult it is to harness all the wonderful capability of the systems that we have today in GDIN's effort to improve its ability to improve disaster response. It turns out that it is simply very difficult to share information across systems - where \"sharing\" means both the ability to find the right information, when it is needed, as well as the ability to use it across systems.</div><br><div>Even harder is the ability to use the computer networks to monitor and reflect status. Anyone that regularly uses e-mail can readily imagine how the chaotic flow of messages between the different people and organizations during a disaster falls far short of creating the information framework that is required for an effectively coordinated response. Make no mistake about it, GDIN and its member disaster response organizations find computers to be very useful - but it is even more striking how the capabilities offered by today's personal productivity and publishing systems are mismatched to the needs of these organizations as they work to coordinate effective response flexibly and quickly.</div><br><div>\"Difficulties with knowledge governance. - As another example of our still relatively primitive ability to deal with information exchange among groups, consider the chaotic and increasingly frightening direction of new laws regarding knowledge governance - most notably reflected in laws regarding copyright. Because it is generally technically advanced, one might think that my country, the United States, would be representative of leading edge capability to deal with knowledge governance and knowledge sharing. But, instead, we are passing increasingly draconian laws to protect the economic value of copies of information. In the US, we are even  contemplating laws that would require hardware manufacturers to take steps to encrypt and protect copies (ref. 2)<br>We are doing this while entering a digital era in which the marginal cost of a copy is zero - at a time where the very meaning and significance of the notion of \"copy\" has changed. It is as if we are trying to erect dikes, using laws, to keep the future from flooding in..</div><br><div>The immediate effect of all this is to enable a dramatic shift in control to the owners of information, away from the users of information (ref. 3) - a strategy which will almost certainly fail in  the long run and that has confusing and probably damaging economic consequences in the short run.</div><br><div>The most modest conclusion that one might draw from watching the U.S. attempt to deal with knowledge governance in a digital age is that the legislators have a weak understanding of the issues and are responding to the enormous political power of the companies with vested interest in old ways of using information. Looking somewhat more deeply, it seems quite clear that we are ill-prepared to come to terms with an environment in which the social value of knowledge emerges from collaborative use of it. The entire idea of value emerging from sharing, collaboration, and use of knowledge - as opposed to treating knowledge as a scarce resource that should be owned and protected - is anathema to the  20th century knowledge owners, who are fighting hard to protect their turf.</div><br><div>STRUCTURAL ROOTS OF THE PROBLEM</div><br><div>One possible response to my examples is to say, \"Doug, be patient. These are new problems and hard problems and it takes time to solve them. We will have better tools and better laws over time. Just wait.\"</div><br><div>An off-handed response might be that I have been trying to be patient for fifty years. But a much more important, meaningful response is that patience has nothing to do with it. These problems are not due to lack of time, but are instead due to structural factors that create a systematic bias against the improvement of what I call \"Collective IQ.\"</div><br><div>The good news is that, if we can see and understand the bias, we have the opportunity to change it. If we can see how some of the basic assumptions that we bring to the development of computing technologies lead us away from improvement in our ability to solve problems collectively, we can reexamine those assumptions and chart a different course.</div><br><div>>Oxymoron: \"Market Intelligence\" - One of the strongly held beliefs within the United States is that the best way to choose between competing technologies and options for investment is to \"let the market decide.\" In my country we share a mystical, almost religious kind of faith in the efficacy of this approach, growing from Adam Smith's idea of an \"invisible hand\" controlling markets and turning selfish interest into general good. The \"market\" assumes the dimensions of faceless, impersonal deity, punishing economically inefficient solutions and rewarding the economically fit. We believe in the wisdom of the market and belief that it represents a collective intelligence that surpasses the understanding of us poor mortal players in the market's great plan.</div><br><div>One of the nice things about getting outside the U.S. - giving a talk here, in Singapore, for example - is that it is a little easier to see what an odd belief this is. It is one of the strange quirks of the U.S. culture.</div><br><div>In any case, it is quite clear that whatever it is that the market \"knows,\" its knowledge is fundamentally conservative in that it only values what is available today. Markets are, in particular, notoriously poor judges of value for things that are not currently being bought and sold. In other words, markets do a bad job at assessing the value of innovation when that innovation is so new that it will actually rearrange the structure of the markets.</div><br><div>This is well understood by people doing market research. Decades ago, when Hewlett Packard was first coming up with the idea of a desktop laser printer - before anyone had experience with such devices and before there was even software available for desktop publishing - market studies of the potential use and penetration for desktop laser printing came up with a very strange answer: people simply did not yet have enough experience with the devices to be able to understand their value. The same thing happened to companies, ten to fifteen years ago, when they did market studies about the potential value and use of digital cameras.</div><br><div>Perhaps the best study of this systematic and very basic conflict between markets and certain kind of innovations is Clayton Christensen's classic and very valuable book, The Innovator's Dilemma (ref. 4). Probably most of you are familiar with Christensen's thesis (if you haven't read the book, you should), but, briefly stated, it is that one kind of innovation - Christensen calls it \"continuous innovation\" - emerges when companies do a good job of staying close to their customers and, in general, \"listening to the market.\" This is the kind of innovation that produces better versions of the kinds of products that are already in the market. If we were all riding tricycles, continuous innovation would lead to more efficient, more comfortable, and perhaps more affordable tricycles.</div><br><div>But it would never, ever produce a bicycle. To do that, you need a different kind of innovation - one that usually, at the outset, results in products that do not make sense to the existing market and that it therefore cannot value. Christensen calls this \"discontinuous innovation.\"</div><br><div>Discontinuous innovation is much riskier,  in that it is much less predicable,  than continuous innovation. It disrupts markets. It threatens the positions of market leaders because, as leaders, they need to \"listen\" to the existing market and existing customers and keep building improved versions of the old technology, rather than take advantage of the new innovation. It is this power to create great change that makes discontinuous innovation so valuable over the long run. It is how we step outside the existing paradigm to create something that is really new.</div><br><div>In the past fifty years of history of computing, the one really striking example of discontinuous innovation - the kind where the market's \"intelligence\" approached an IQ of zero - was early generation of World Wide Web software - and in particular, the Mosaic web browser. There were, as the Web first emerged, numerous companies selling highly functional electronic page viewers - viewers that could jump around in electronic books, follow different kinds of hyperlinks, display vector graphics, and do many other things that early web browsers could not do. The companies in this early electronic publishing business were actually able to sell these \"electronic readers\" for as much as US $50 a \"seat\" - meaning that, when selling electronic document viewers to big companies with many users, this was big business.</div><br><div>Then, along came the Web and Mosaic - a free Web browser that was much less functional than these proprietary offers. But it was free! And, more important, it could do something else that these other viewers could not do - it provided access to information anywhere in the world on the Web. As a result, over the next few years, everything changed. We actually did get closer to the goal of computers assisting with collaborative work.</div><br><div>But the key point of the story is that, at first, the \"market intelligence\" saw no value in web browsers at all. In fact, the market leader, Microsoft, initially started off in the direction of building its own proprietary viewer and network - because that is what market intelligence suggested would work. Fortunately for Microsoft's shareholders, Bill Gates realized that he was facing a discontinuity, and threw the company into a sudden and aggressive campaign to change course.</div><br><div>Despite the Web, despite the example of Mosaic, despite all the work that Christensen has done to teach us about discontinuous innovation, most companies still act as if they believe that the market is intelligent - and, to be sure, this approach really does often work, in the short term. So we are saddled with a systematic, built-in bias against thinking outside the box. And that bias gets in the way of solving hard problems, such as building high performance tools that help groups of people collaborate more effectively.</div><br><div>In a little bit, I will explain how we can overcome such systematic bias and open the doors to the very substantial rewards from continued, productive discontinuous innovation. There is huge opportunity here - and it is an opportunity that will be most available to emerging economies rather than to the incumbents. But, before turning to solutions, I need to tell you about another dimension of systematic bias that is getting in the way of our making important progress in finding new ways to use computers.</div><br><div>\"The seductive, destructive appeal of \"ease of use.\" - A second powerful, systematic bias that leads computing technology development away from grappling with serious issues of collaboration - the kind of thing, for example, that would really make a difference to disaster response organizations - is the belief that \"ease of use\" is somehow equated with better products.<br>Going back to my tricycle/bicycle analogy, it is clear that for an unskilled user, the tricycle is much easier to use. But, as we know, the payoff from investing in learning to ride on two wheels is enormous.</div><br><div>We seem to lose sight of this very basic distinction between \"ease of use\" and \"performance\" when we evaluate computing systems. For example, just a few weeks ago, in early March, I was invited to participate in a set of discussions, held at IBM's Almaden Labs, that looked at new research and technology associated with knowledge management and retrieval. One thing that was clearly evident in these presentations was that the first source of bias - the tendency to look solely to the invisible hand and intelligence of the market for guidance, was in full gear. Most of the presenters were looking to build a better tricycle, following the market to the next stage of continuous innovation, rather than stepping outside the box to consider something really new.</div><br><div>But there was another bias, even in the more innovative work - and that bias had to do with deciding to set aside technology and user interactions that were \"too difficult\" for users to learn. I was particularly disappointed to learn, for example, that one of the principal websites offering knowledge retrieval on the web had concluded that a number of potentially more powerful searching tools should not be offered because user testing discovered that they were not easy to use.</div><br><div>Here in Singapore, I see a lot of people wind surfing. I am sure that there are beginner boards and sails, just as in kayaking there are beamy, forgiving boats that are good for beginners, and in tennis there are powerful racquets that make it easy for beginners to wallop the ball even with a short swing. But someone who wants real performance in wind surfing, to have control in difficult conditions, does not want a beginning board. Someone who wants a responsive kayak, that will perform well in following seas and surf, does not want a beginner's boat. A serious tennis player with a powerful swing does not want a beginner's racquet.</div><br><div>Why do we assume that, in computing, ease of use - particularly ease of use by people with little training - is desirable for anyone other than a beginner?  Sure, I understand that the big money for a company making surfboards, tennis racquets, skis, golf clubs, and what-have-you is always in the low end of the market, serving the weekend amateur. And surely the same thing is true in computing. That is not surprising. What is surprising is that, in serious discussions with serious computer/human factors experts, who are presumably trying to address hard problems of knowledge use and collaboration, ease of use keeps emerging as a key design consideration.</div><br><div>Doesn't anyone ever aspire to serious amateur or pro status in knowledge work?</div><br><div>RESTORING BALANCE</div><br><div>I need to remind you of what I said at the beginning of this talk: we have made huge strides forward in computing. It is a wonderful thing to have a large, mass market for equipment that has brought the cost of computing hardware and software down to the point where truly staggering computing capability is available for a few thousand - even a few hundred - dollars. It has been a marvelous fifty years. But I want to alert you to two very important facts:</div><br><div>We are still not able to address critically important problems - particularly if those problems demand high performance ability to collect and share knowledge across groups of people.</div><br><div>This inability is not an accident, but emerges from values and approaches that are \"designed into\" our approach to addressing innovation in computing.<br>These facts are critical for institutions and individuals who are interested in improving our ability to improve. I am pretty sure that this includes everyone in this audience. The important realization - and the message of this talk - is that these institutions and individuals can take big steps forward simply by systematically addressing the biases that are pushing innovation toward lowest common denominator solutions and toward simple continuation down roads that we already understand. This does not mean that we should stop building easy to use applications that represent continuous innovation. What it does mean is that we also need to find ways to address the harder problems and to stimulate more discontinuous innovation.</div><br><div>This focus on new, discontinuous innovation is particularly important for the majority of people and nations in the world who are building emerging economies. It is the developing nations that  have the most to gain from developing new ways to share knowledge and to stimulate improvement.</div><br><div>MOVING FROM \"INVISIBLE HAND\" TO STRATEGY</div><br><div>The good news is that it is possible to build an infrastructure that supports discontinuous innovation. There is no need at all to depend on mystical, invisible hands and the oracular pronouncements hidden within the marketplace. The alternative is conscious investment in an improvement infrastructure to support new, discontinuous innovation (ref. 5).</div><br><div>This is something that individual organizations can do - it is also something that local governments, nations, and regional alliances of nations can do. All that is necessary is an understanding of how to structure that conscious investment.</div><br><div>\"ABCs of improvement infrastructure. - The key to developing an effective improvement infrastructure is the realization that, within any organization, there is a division of attention between the part of the organization that is concerned with the organization's primary activity - I will call this the \"A\" activity - and the part of the organization concerned with improving the capability to perform this A-level function. I refer to these improvement efforts as \"B\" activities. The two different levels of activity are illustrated in \".</div><br><div>Graphic depicting Infrastructure fundamentals: A and B Activities<br>Figure 1. Infrastructure fundamentals: A and B Activities (Engelbart, 1962, 1992)<br>The investment made in B activities is recaptured, along with an aggressive internal rate of return, through improved productivity in the A activity. If investments in R&D, IT infrastructure, and other dimensions of the B activity are effective, the rate of return for a dollar invested in the B activity will be higher than for a dollar invested in the A activity.</div><br><div>Clearly, there are limits to how far a company can pursue an investment and growth strategy based on type B activities - at some point the marginal returns for new investment begin to fall off. This leads to a question: How can we maximize the return from investment in B activities, maximizing the improvement that they enable?</div><br><div>Put another way, we are asking how we improve our ability to improve. This question suggests that we really need to think in terms of yet another level of activity - I call it the \"C\" activity - that focuses specifically on the matter of accelerating the rate of improvement. Figure 2 shows what I mean.</div><br><div><br>Introducing 'C' level activity to improve the ability to improve<br>Figure 2. Introducing \"C\" level activity to improve the ability to improve (Engelbart, 1962)<br>Clearly, investment in type C activities is potentially highly leveraged. The right investments here will be multiplied in returns in increased B level productivity - in the ability to improve - which will be multiplied again in returns in productivity in the organization's primary activity. It is a way of getting a kind of compound return on investment in innovation.</div><br><div>The highly leveraged nature of investment in type C activities make this kind of investment in innovation particularly appropriate for governments, public service institutions such as libraries, and broad consortia of different companies and agencies across an entire industry. The reason for this is not only that a small investment here can make a big difference - though that certainly is an important consideration - but also because the investment in C activities is typically pre-competitive. It is investment that can be shared even among competitors in an industry because it is, essentially, investment in creating a better playing field. Perhaps the classic recent example of such investment in the U.S. is the relatively small investment that the Department of Defense made in what eventually became the Internet.</div><br><div>Another example, looking to the private sector, is the investment that companies made in improving product and process quality as they joined in the quality movement. What was particularly important about this investment was that, when it came to ISO 9000 compliance and other quality programs and measures, companies - even competing companies - joined together in industry consortia to develop benchmarks and standards. They even shared knowledge about quality programs. What emerged from this collaborative activity at the C level was significant gain for individual companies at the B and A levels. When you are operating at the C level, collaboration can produce much larger returns than competition.</div><br><div>INVESTING WISELY IN IMPROVEMENT</div><br><div>Let's keep our bigger goal in mind: we want to correct the current bias, emerging from over-reliance on market forces and the related obsession with ease of use that get in the way of developing better computing tools. We want to do this so that we can use computers to augment the capabilities of entire groups of people as they share knowledge and work together on truly difficult problems. The proposal that I am placing on the table is to correct that bias by making relatively small, but highly leveraged investments in efforts to improve our ability to improve - in what I have called type C activities.</div><br><div>The proposal is attractive not only for quantitative reasons - because it can produce a lot of change with a relatively small investment - but also for qualitative reasons:  This kind of investment is best able to support disruptive innovation - the kind of innovation that is necessary to embrace a new, knowledge-centered society. The acceleration in movement away from economic systems based on manufacturing and toward systems based on knowledge needs to be reflected in accelerated change in our ways of working with each other. This is the kind of change that we can embrace by focusing on type C activity and on improvement of our ability to improve.</div><br><div>Given all of that, what do we need to do?  If, say, Singapore wants to use this kind of investment as a focus for its development activity, where does it concentrate its attention?  If the organizations participating in this World Library Summit want to support and stimulate this kind of investment, where do they begin?</div><br><div>The answer to such questions has two different, but complementary dimensions. The first dimension has to do with process:  How do you operate and set expectations in a way that is consistent with productive type C activity?  The second dimension has to do with actual tools and techniques.</div><br><div>PROCESS CONSIDERATIONS</div><br><div>Making an investment in type C activity is not the same as investing in research into new materials or in an ERP system to provide better control over inventory and accounting. Those kinds of investments have very specific objectives and tend to proceed in a straight line from specification to final delivery. Sure, we know that there are usually surprises and unplanned side trips, but that is not the initial expectation. B level investments are supposed to be predictable. Nobody, for example, would think of installing two ERP systems - say, SAP and Peoplesoft - to discover which is better. In B-level investment, you make the design decisions up front and then implement the design.</div><br><div>That is not the way it works with C-level investments. Here, you typically do, in fact, pursue multiple paths concurrently. At the C level we are trying to understand how improvement really happens, so that we can improve our ability to improve. This means having different groups exploring different paths to the same goal. As they explore, they constantly exchange information about what they are learning. The goal is to maximize overall progress by exchanging important information as the different groups proceed. What this means, in practice, is that the dialog between the people working toward pursuit of the goal is often just as important as the end result of the research. Often, it is what the team learns in the course of the exploration that ultimately opens up breakthrough results.</div><br><div>Another difference between innovation at the C level and innovation that is more focused on specific results is that, at the C level, context is tremendously important.  We are not trying to solve a specific problem, but, instead, are reaching for insight into a broad class of activities and opportunities for improvement. That means attending to external information as well as to the specifics of the particular work at hand. In fact, in my own work, I have routinely found that when I seem to reach a dead end in my pursuit of a problem, the key is usually to move up a level of abstraction, to look at the more general case.</div><br><div>Note that this is directly counter to the typical approach to solving focused, B-level problems, where you typically keep narrowing the problem in order to make it more tractable. In our work on improving improvement, the breakthroughs come from the other direction - from taking on an even bigger problem.</div><br><div>So, the teams working at the C-level are working in parallel, sharing information with each other, and also tying what they find to external factors and bigger problems. Put more simply, C-level work requires investment integration - a concerted effort to tie the pieces together.</div><br><div>That is, by the way, the reason that the teams that I was leading at SRI were developing ways to connect information with hyperlinks, and doing this more than two decades before it was happening on the web. Hyperlinks were quite literally a critical part of our ability to keep track of what we were doing.</div><br><div>Thinking back to our research at SRI leads me to another key feature of development work at the C level:  You have to apply what you discover. That is the way that you reach out and snatch a bit of the future and bring it back to the present:  You grab it and use it.</div><br><div>At the C-level, then, the approach focuses on:</div><br><div>Concurrent development</div><br><div>Integration across the different concurrent activities though continuous dialog and through constant cross checking with external information</div><br><div>Application of the knowledge that is gained, as a way of not only testing it, but also as a way to understand its nature and its ability to support improvement.<br>As a mnemonic device to help pull together these key features of the C-level process, you can take \"Concurrent Development,\" \"Integration,\" and \"Application of Knowledge\" and put them together in the term \"CoDIAK.\" For me, this invented word has become my shorthand for the most important characteristics of the C-level discovery activity. Figure 3 illustrates the way that the CoDIAK process builds on continuous, dynamic integration of information so that the members of the improvement team can learn from each other and move forward.</div><br><div>Graphic depicting Key elements of the CoDIAK process<br>Figure 3. Key elements of the CoDIAK process (Engelbart, 1992)</div><br><div>INVESTMENT IN TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES</div><br><div>Returning once again to the main theme of this talk, my goal is to help the people at this World Library Summit see how they, through their governments and institutions, can make a highly leveraged investment in a different kind of innovation, one that will open up new opportunities and capabilities in computing. Part of what is needed is a new approach to the process of innovation - that is what CoDIAK is all about. But pursuit of CoDIAK requires, in itself, some technical infrastructure  to support the concurrent development and continual integration of dialog, external information, and new knowledge. If this sounds somewhat recursive to you, like the snake renewing itself by swallowing its own tail, be assured that the recursion is not an accident. As I just said, one of the key principles in CoDIAK is the application and use of what you learn. That recursive, reflective application gets going right at the outset. So, what do we need to get started?</div><br><div>One of the most important things that we need is a place to keep and share the information that we collect - the dialog, the external information, the things that we learn. I call this the \"Dynamic Knowledge Repository,\" or DKR. It is more than a database, and more than a simple collection of Internet web sites. It doesn't have to be all in one place - it can certainly be distributed across the different people and organizations that are collaborating on improving improvement - but it does need to be accessible to everyone - for reading, for writing, and for making new connections.</div><br><div>The DKR is a wonderful example of the kind of investment that you can start making at the C level, with modest means, that will pay dividends back as it moves up the line to the B and the A levels. This is exactly what I mean when I talk about \"bootstrapping.\" It is a very American term - the image is of someone able to perform the wonderful, impossible trick of pulling himself up by pulling up on his own bootstraps - but the idea is one that we put into practice every time that we \"boot up\" a computer. A small bit of code in a permanent read only memory knows how to go out to the disk to get more instructions, that in turn know how do to even more things, such as getting even more instructions. Eventually, this process of using successive steps to lead to ever bigger steps, building on each other, get the whole machine up and running. You start small, and keep leveraging what you know at each stage to solve a bigger and bigger problem.</div><br><div>This is precisely the kind of outcome that can come from investment in building a DKR at the C level. What you learn there can be used to improve work at the C level, which in turn improves ability at the B level, which then translates into new capability at the primary, A level of the organization.</div><br><div>Another key, early investment is in the development of tools to provide access to the knowledge in the DKR for all classes of users, from beginners to professional knowledge workers expecting high performance. This \"hyperscope\" - that is my term for it - allows everyone to contribute and use the information in the DKR according to his or her ability. It avoids the problem of making everyone, even the pros, play with the same, over-powered tennis racquets that are helpful for beginners.</div><br><div>Tied to the hyperscope is the ability to provide different views of the knowledge in the DKR - and I do mean \"views\" - stressing the \"visual\" sense of the term. Moving away from words on a page, we need to be able to analyze an argument - or the results of a meeting - visually. We need to move beyond understanding the computer as some kind of fancy printing machine and begin to use it to analyze and manipulate the symbolic content of our work, extending our own capabilities. We already do this in specialized cases; one of the most spectacular recent examples was the use of high-performance computing in the analysis of the sequences that make up the human genome. Now we need to extend that to the more general class of problems that groups of people encounter as they work together, try to understand each other, and reach collaboratively for decisions.</div><br><div>Another critical focus area for tool and technology development centers on the way that humans interacts with computers. We have come far since the early 1950s, when my colleagues felt that such interaction was not worth thinking about. And, as most of you know, it was in the course of trying to broaden the bandwidth of the connection between humans and computers, incorporating both visual and motor skill dimensions, that I developed my most famous invention, the computer \"mouse.\"</div><br><div>There is so much more to be done here - I feel that we have just scratched the surface. Figure 4 provides you with an overview of this very fertile field and opportunity for breakthrough innovation.</div><br><div>Graphic depicting Key elements of the CoDIAK process</div><br><div>Figure 4. The Human-Augmentation System Interface (Engelbart, 1962, 1992)<br>The Capability Infrastructure - which is the thing in the middle of this picture and is what we are talking about improving when we are working at the C level of innovation - combines inputs from both the tool system and the human system. The tool system - that's the contribution from the computer, provides access to different media, gives us different ways to portray information, and so on. The human system brings its rich store of paradigms, information captured in customs, and so on. The more static parts of this collection can be added directly into the Capability Infrastructure through construction of ontologies and other artifacts.</div><br><div>The human system, as the part of this framework that is best at learning, also brings the opportunity to develop new skills, benefit from training, and to assimilate and create new knowledge. These dynamic elements are the \"magic dust\" that makes the whole system capable of innovation and of solving complex problems. These are what make an \"augmentation  system\" different than a mere automation system.</div><br><div>These valuable, dynamic, human inputs must of course come into the system through the human's motor and perceptual capabilities. It is the boundary between these human capabilities and the rest of the infrastructure - represented by the heavy, broken line in this figure and labeled \"H-AS Interface\" - that, in a very real sense, defines the scope of the capabilities of this augmentation system. If this interface is low-bandwidth and able to pass only a small amount of what the human knows and can do - and what the machine can portray - then the entire system tends to be more \"automation\" than \"augmentation,\" since the computer and the human are being kept apart by this low-fidelity, limited interface.</div><br><div>If, on the other hand, this interface can operate at high speed and capture great nuance - perhaps even extending to changes in facial expression, heart rate, or fine motor responses, then we greatly increase the potential to integrate the human capabilities directly into the overall system, which means that we can then feed them back, amplify them, and use them.</div><br><div>When you begin to conceive of the human-system interface in this way, the whole notion of \"ease of use\" - this matter that we are now so obsessed with - appears, as it should, as merely a single and, in the grand scheme of things, not terribly important dimension within a much richer structure. The key to building a more powerful capability infrastructure lies in expanding the channels and modes of communication - not simplifying them.</div><br><div>This is very powerful, exciting stuff. If we begin to act on this notion of our relation, as humans, to these amazing machines that we have created, we really begin to open up new opportunities for growth and problem solving.</div><br><div>I could go on and on. And will be happy to for anyone with the patience and interest in understanding what is possible. Just call me up, arrange an audience where, working together, we can make a difference, and I will be there.</div><br><div>The point here, for this talk, for this audience, is that the commitment to the CoDIAK process leads to very specific directions for investments in technology development - the kinds of investments that your companies, agencies, institutions, and governments can make. And the reason for making them is to open the doors to new kinds of innovation - giving you the power to address much harder, but potentially much richer kinds of problems.</div><br><div>YOUR INVOLVEMENT MATTERS</div><br><div>Well, we are reaching the point in this talk where I should soon be thanking you for your attention and asking whether you have any questions. But, before I go there, I want to tell you again why this matters so much, with the hope of securing your commitment to help in moving us out of the dangerous, disappointing, narrow path that we seem to be stuck with following.</div><br><div>The feature of humans that makes us most human - that most clearly differentiates us from every other life form on Earth - is not our opposable thumb, and not even our use of tools. It is our ability to create and use symbols. The ability to look at the world, turn what we see into abstractions, and to then operate on those abstractions, rather than on the physical world itself, is an utterly astounding, beautiful thing, just taken all by itself. We manifest this ability to work with symbols in wonderful, beautiful ways, through music, through art, through our buildings and through our language - but the fundamental act of symbol making and symbol using is beautiful in itself.</div><br><div>Consider, as a simple, but very powerful example, our invention of the negative - our ability to deal with what something is not, just as easily as we deal with what it is. There is no \"not,\" no negative, in nature, outside of the human mind. But we invented it, we use it daily, and divide up the world with it. It is an amazing creation, and one that is quintessentially human.</div><br><div>The thing that amazed me - even humbled me - about the digital computer when I first encountered it over fifty years ago - was that, in the computer, I saw that we have a tool that does not just move earth or bend steel, but we have a tool that actually can manipulate symbols and, even more importantly, portray symbols in new ways, so that we can interact with them and learn. We have a tool that radically extends our capabilities in the very area that makes us most human, and most powerful.</div><br><div>There is a native American myth about the coyote, a native dog of the American prairies - how the coyote incurred the wrath of the gods by bringing fire down from heaven for the use of mankind, making man more powerful than the gods ever intended. My sense is that computer science has brought us a gift of even greater power, the ability to amplify and extend our ability to manipulate symbols.</div><br><div>It seems to me that the established sources of power and wealth understand, in some dim way, that the new power that the computer has brought from the heavens is dangerous to the existing structure of ownership and wealth in that, like fire, it has the power to transform and to make things new.</div><br><div>I must say that, despite the cynicism that comes with fifty years of professional life as a computer scientist, inventor, and observer of the ways of power, I am absolutely stunned at the ferocious strength of the efforts of the American music industry, entertainment industry, and other established interests to resist the new ability that the coyote in the computer has brought from the heavens. I am even more surprised by the ability of these established interests to pass laws that promise punishment to those who would experiment and learn to use the new fire.</div><br><div>As the recipient of my country's National Medal of Technology, I am committed to raising these issues and questions within my own country, but I am also canny enough to understand that, in the short term, it is the nations with emerging economies that are most likely to understand the critical importance and enormous value in learning to use this new kind of fire.</div><br><div>We need to become better at being humans. Learning to use symbols and knowledge in new ways, across groups, across cultures, is a powerful, valuable, and very human goal. And it is also one that is obtainable, if we only begin to open our minds to full, complete use of computers to augment our most human of capabilities.</div><br><div>THE BOOTSTRAP ALLIANCE</div><br><div>I come to this conference representing my own small organization, the Bootstrap Alliance. We don't sell a product or anything else. But we do offer an opportunity for you to be actively engaged with other people and other institutions that are interested in understanding how to use this new fire that has been brought down from the heavens.</div><br><div>More specifically, the Bootstrap Alliance is an improvement community that is made up of other improvement communities - we are focused on improving the ability to improve, and on helping other groups that share those interests do a better job of it. We exist to help C-level organizations do a better job of being C-level organizations. Our approach to this, not surprisingly, is based on concurrent development, integration, and application of knowledge across those different pioneering communities.</div><br><div>If you are interested in investing in the kind of critically important, highly leveraged mechanisms for change that I talk about here - in using the fire brought down from heaven - please come up and talk to me or e-mail me at doug@bootstrap.org. We have a lot of work to do together, and no time at all to be patient.</div><br><div>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</div><br><div>I would like to recognize the assistance I had from Bill Zoellick in preparing this paper, particularly for his contributions concerning recent copyright activity and regarding the interaction of markets and innovation.<br></div>",

        "full": "<div>Speaker 1:\tThank you all for coming. In these speaker series it seems time like we have a mix of 2 different things. First we invite in speakers who've really built really neat systems and have something exciting to talk about and then we have the people who have really changed the way we look at the world and I think Doug Engelbart here really fits in that second category. </div><br><div>\tA lot of you maybe are too young to know that most of what we see as a modern computer system today has risen out of the vision that Doug had 30 years ago, the invention of the mouse and Windows systems, and the idea of hypertext which is not yet fully realized but it what this company is built on as well as other ideas and help systems and so on and so on. Having Doug here is really like having a time machine that helps us look out 20 or 30 years into the future. Let's let him take it away and see where the world is going to end up. </div><br><div>Doug:\tIf he did a good job there well I could say thank you very much and leave but interview tried to think a long time about how can I make a presentation that will teach you something or educate you or keep you awake and still tell my whole story. It turned out that that probably wasn't doable so I had 2 women who are very energetically oriented about how to tell stories come this morning and they paired me way down. If I get off track it's their fault. This title is very meaningful to me and what's a collective IQ will come out a little bit early in the thing and we'll dive down thank you deeply pretty soon. This stems from way back that just engaged the 25 year old country kid, that's me then; I'm a 79 year old country kid now. </div><br><div>\tAnyway I'd just gotten engaged and heading in for work. I worked as an electrical engineer out at [Ames 00:02:28] Lab, as a matter of fact. I said, \"Oh boy, it's going to be excited to get married.\" I was thinking all the planning and family stuff and then started to try to think about the job and I realized I had never thought about having career goals. I was too much of a country kid, ingenuous so I did that. What do you think happened? This is what popped out of my head. If I run it get a professional goal and I just bought it, \"OK, that's what I'm going to pursue.\" I had no idea what it meant. </div><br><div>\tBy 3 months later I was reading and studying and talking to people, etc. I got to this [inaudible 00:03:13] so that goal emerged \"As much as possible, to boost mankind's collective capability for coping with complex, urgent problems.\" That every big problem I was good picture that I could go after to make the first goal be right I begin to realize how complex the big problems are because they involve so many people and so many factors, critical things as well as praying [inaudible 00:03:40] dollars or whatever and that they have to be dealt with collectively. Our collective ability to deal with complex, urgent problems isn't increasing anywhere near as fast as the complexity of the problems. That's still true today. </div><br><div>\tThat complexity on its own is going up faster and faster so I feel like going after that ability for collectively coping and I call it Collective IQ is to me it's just a matter of almost of how we have a chance to survive as a race because there's no guarantee. I got this image of ants that grew up and climbed up and made a nest in a tree and it got bigger and bigger and the valves were bumping like this. This visual ants inside that could tell everybody nobody would believe them; that's something no one [bothered about 00:04:34] until the thing broke and it fell in the water below and all the ants died. There are problems facing the earth today that could be that bad and we just can't get them in sight.</div><br><div>\tI didn't know where to go to school to learn about that or [inaudible 00:04:53] so I thought I'll go learn about research so I went to Berkeley and got a PhD because they were building a computer. That's before there were computers. If I could just tell you a lot of stories about what you call the paradigms that exist in society; that's their perception about what's going on in the world and what you can do and void. If you were talking about things that didn't fit into the paradigm zone you just got out of it. So I got explained to me carefully that I probably wouldn't do very well staying and teaching like I thought I was going to do in the university because peer review if they hear this kind of stuff coming out of your mouth you'll never get there. There were lots of stories from the old day that you kids would like to hear. </div><br><div>\tI think the world is slowly changing. Here's one way to look at this [inaudible 00:05:50] any collection of quite a few people that you see around this blob here all communicated to each other what their commonly supposed to handle some big tough problem out there. They're been interacting, ingesting, bringing and scanning information, etc., recording their dialog, collecting intelligence, and some way they've got to generate a knowledge product which is so to say how do we get the understanding we need. This thing of collectively developing, integrating, and applying knowledge, CODIAK, I started calling that the kind of capabilities that you need. </div><br><div>\tThis whole thing is a problem and then this particular set of knowledge in there I came to calling it dynamic knowledge repository; that's going to follow us all the way through this talk as the central thing of [mix technically 00:06:43] human kind of things that how do develop a body of knowledge that give you the best possible understanding of the kind of challenge you're facing together. We're far sure that a group who does a good job of saying, \"Hey, what's out there that might be useful\" but how do you take that and integrate that into \"here's what the current state seems to be of the knowledge. The conflicts at different places like this, these 17 conflicts they're going to resolve temporarily because this is what seems to counter them but here's some ones, etc.\"  That's been the target but as we'll talk about.<br>\tHow do you get the understanding you need? How do you unearth and assess the different candidate solutions? How do you assess your resources and your operational capabilities to select the appropriate solution commitment you're going to make? How do you be effective in organizing and executing that selected approach? You're bound to have unforeseen complications come up that you have to monitor to be able to adapt to. All of that takes the best understanding you can and when they got really, really big problems, tough one that's a central challenge. That's not the only challenge but it's the one I decided to follow and [inaudible 00:08:02].</div><br><div>\tCapabilities, way back in the early 60s I spent a year and a half in solitary confinement generating a [thig 00:08:14] piece that I called Augmenting the Human Intellect. Out of that came a lot of perceptions that we hold true; they didn't do me much good in the early days because they didn't fit the paradigms but now to me they're very, very, meaningful. This thing about capability and capability infrastructures is something I'll go into now but I'll try to go by it pretty quickly and get down to things that might be more interesting technically to you. He says, \"OK, for you or any organization or any collection of the civilization that is said, 'We have this problem in common' the capability for dealing with it and any capability say essential like maybe this central one here is your capability to handle your professional role. Well, that's depending on a bunch of other capabilities; they in turn are depending upon others and it's not a hierarchy, it's just a infrastructure that goes on down like this and way down here are some pretty basic capability you'll have to have. </div><br><div>\tThe thing's so much orientation in the world today is sort of like, \"Oh, it's the technology, boy, they're the things we're going to invent a technology; it'll come in and it'll fix everything. That was what I was hearing a lot in the 60s. Office automation for instance. I just say, \"Wait a minute, you know, they coming in and making a change and there are probably a lot of other changes that go with it.\" \"Like what? What do you mean other changes?\" Well, I didn't have any ... I just invented the term human system and now anthropologist or anybody is [glomming 00:09:54] out about that but really are all those kinds of things that generally adapt on some new artifact or technology that comes forth to sort of serve society. Whatever image people had of the outset of boy what this is going to do, the evolution would start clanging the environment a great deal. I got very interested in old cars way, way back. I was aware of the kinds of dialogues and activities going on at the turn of the century when auto deals started appear.</div><br><div>\tIf you went back 100 years from now and talked to some well-educated dynamic business person or whatever and started talking to him about what cars will become and they just pretty soon would not believe you. Women probably aren't going to be able to drive; that was pretty common in there. 35 miles an hour top speed. Boy, you just can't [inaudible 00:10:51] like that. Then if you try to describe freeway travel today, 70 miles an hour. Well, how do you get on? Get them to stop for you? No, you merge and then in describing the merging thing you can just see them cringe. You explain 70 miles an hour and he slows down a little bit to let you just come in because if he didn't you'd crash. That's right so he'll slow down. Well, how do you check to be sure? You use your rear view mirror. What's that? It's a mirror up here like that. You check on it. You got to be kidding me. </div><br><div>\tYou realize they used it for shaving and powdering your face and no thought about that you can get judgement of what's happening 20 yards behind you at 70 miles an hour. How much do they weigh? 4,000 pounds. Oh, God. They simply wouldn't believe that you can get condition but nobody just takes it for granted; they don't even think about it today where you stop at a stop light. Oh, yeah, okay, well, I see. Well of course if it's a red light and there's nobody else there you go ahead don't you? No, no, no. Oh, you got to be kidding. New culture. <br>\tThere's a great number of things you do when you're driving. Just stop to realize that you're driving in a lane 60, 50, 60, 70 miles an hour and how much attention o you pay about keeping the car in that lane? Just very little; you're talking to everybody and there's some odd kind of automatic things that your perceptual machine grabs for you and adjust for it. That would just be out of people's picture. </div><br><div>\tThe many other things you look at, elevators coming in. How high was the highest building then? 6'8, maybe 10 stories. Oh my gosh. That was automating your way up to the 10th floor, huh? Yeah but look how much it changed the world; it's much higher. This is what goes on. The thing is I just say over and over again there's nobody that understands this dynamic system enough to know what in 5 years it's going to be like. How did the [inaudible 00:13:06] What kind of technological capabilities and stuff is really going to be in this world? </div><br><div>\tTo complete this story a little bit more here this says okay there's these basic human capabilities that the uneducated, untrained, unconditioned person has so with that has to go skills, motives, and training. He says, \"Yeah, that's right.\" All of that together I had to invent a name; call that the Augmentation System. That system is what provides us humans with the kind of capability we operate on today, in [inaudible 00:13:41] All of this tool system, human system, etc. has evolved culturally and for a long. Long, long, long time. We're in the middle of a rate of evolution that's unprecedented. Here's something to think about is the world's full of human computer interaction kinds of studies but the real thing is how does the human interact without Augmentation System and learn to adapt and adjust. This is kind of the whole picture I've been operating on all this time and I go in this detail here because I want to ... Is there a clock in [the room 00:14:21] </div><br><div>Female 1:\t2:18.</div><br><div>Doug:\t[She's a physician 00:14:26] I started at 2:15 and it's a half an hour. Boy, I'm sorry. I wanted to go faster but this was just a fundamental sort of way in which the thing got established. We'll move to talking about some special subsets of the tool systems all based upon this dynamic knowledge repository as a real capability target. You look in a matter of scale that that same model I contend holds for every one of these organizational sizes and fits. Boy, so you look at that and says ah that question of scaling comes in a bit. You says, \"Yes, here's my organization or my country or something sitting down there with its DKR development going and it's got all these peers and they're part of the whole organization. </div><br><div>\tThe whole thing has this DKR stuff for handling the largest scale problem. You just know that you can't have different structures and contentions, etc. among the different DKRs in there because they aggregate to be the common one the group fits on. This [cart 00:15:37] tells you the scale and it just won't work that if somebody uses a word and somebody else use something else that they don't have processes by which the respected contributions have been knowledge packages that you put in there can be really integrated and that integration is not just something that you can sight that document so we got things to say about that. Does building using and evaluating DKR is a really central thing. It's interesting to say that the Google search function have an interesting role to play in there about how you find things but then there's that whole business of integrating it all that's left over that it could still facilitate that. </div><br><div>\tOne of the things we talk about is homework are you going to get that evolution going. You have to get groups of people in organizations that start working together to help cultivate and develop that and we've come to call it a Network Improvement Committee. It can be improving any kind of capability that the different member organizations agree let's all work on this common sort of need for capability so the particular kind of capability then that we can special focus on is this dynamic knowledge repository, the capability for doing it and then important things to talk about it. This is a real kind of research. Everybody's been telling me we'll get through this stuff fast Doug so you can get at what these guys will want to see is some of the things that they might be able to do.</div><br><div>\t15 years ago I just said, \"Look we got to have an open Hyperdocument System; I didn't know about Open Source then but it's the same thing. It's the knowledge containers and the processes on them etc. has the open source so that it evolves like a natural language because so much of what you're going to do with this kind of tool system is essentially dealing with natural language and knowledge. The operations and such need to be saying that you've got to have a common language about trying to tell somebody that they're ontology is mixed up on something like this an so and so. It's very much that and so that's something that is complicated.</div><br><div>\tVery early in the 60s even 70s when I was getting research money [inaudible 00:18:10] Ted Nelson coined the term hyper which is fine but I've been so puzzled by the fact that it seems to be just limited to having links that point to something and we were doing a lot more so I'm proposing that the world takes the term hyper and says let's say a hyperdocument is something in which everything you can do with computer support that is beyond what the old technology of printing could provide for you let's call that hyper because here are things that we were doing beyond just a link that our addressability for our links just from the beginning went ... let's say you want to be able to site any object in another document, not just a document so we had that provision ... What do you think? </div><br><div>\tYour link could address and point to any object. It all [inaudible 00:19:19] to other things too. It had indirect addressing just like it had direct addressing and programming. It just says hey I'm pointing to this call or this module or something like that. It has link in it so I want it to go there and take that link; that can be part of an address path. You can have implicit addressing for things like this word is implicitly linked to this definition in the dictionary or to its thesaurus in a given glossary or to its definition and description in the programming languages an operation [inaudible 00:19:54] we had that working; we had include function that at some point her you could say I want to include that whole chapter or that whole section and Nebraska of the viewing option said oh oi only want to see that thing it says it what to include or I want to ask to have the inclusion done. We had many, many things like this going and they just give you such a rich environment. </div><br><div>\tThe prevailing paradigms were that the users have to have something very easy to learn or they're not going to get it. We learned our lesson and went into hibernation for a few decades but that system is something is something that it sort of broke a connection that disabled me from being able to come and actually demonstrate some of those things for you. The optional viewing, too, not just the way the page was printed so the very first kind of thing the option is oh you exercise this little option in you just see the first line of every paragraph and it turns out to be an extremely good way to scan, to see something. If you had a hierarchically structured document which is very useful just show me the top level and only one line. Okay, well, just the first line of the next level, too. Oh, I want to see their address if they all have a location address. 11234 or 1A1BC or 1B12 so that you could show that or not show that. You could say I want to see only those with certain content, you could see that. The flexibility in that just grew and grew. </div><br><div>\tThe command line which actually turned out to be like object oriented in verbs and nouns. It's amazing how the flexibility of that grew but the vocabulary just grew until you would have operations like ... What's this verb called transpose do? Oh, it just interchanges. Interchanges what? Well, the object you describe in your [no 00:22:02] two paragraphs, two chapters. Anyway the flexibility of editing and moving around and viewing and then jumping to where you want to go without having a link just jump. Those things all provided a working environment which just is unequaled still today and we brag about it or something but it says okay it was ahead of its time, that's our word for it. It wasn't. It might be say oh it's a total failure because it will never see again but really it's the kind of thing that this hyper term it says look why don't we really go after active duty capitalize on the fat that the computer can help us do that moving around. <br>\tThat model of an augmentation system there is the human basic capabilities there and is one of the basic capabilities called perceptual. You say oh what's that?  That's like you can look in a mirror and see what's happening but you can look at a set of characters that represent now consonants and vowels and you don't see that you see a word and you don't just see a word you see the meaning and just sweep along to it. That machine has been in your head for thousands of years. 5,000 years ago they had an alphabet but now we got things we portray symbolizing lots of flexible other ways and that machinery is there to learn to adapt to use that. </div><br><div>\tOne thing I just waiting to do if I were smart enough I'd get an idea something's [parser 00:23:39] and now when I'm reading text I would start experimenting with what colors to make what participants of speech that pretty soon that perceptual machine is getting used to it and boy I'll bet you a great deal that we'll be able to read faster and more comprehensibly. </div><br><div>\tIn this evolution this says we're starting with something called a hyperscope; we extend the viewing and making options. we'll add optional user interfaces systems and this what I really feel like I have this open hyperdocument system evolving you can plug in different user interface systems to say okay you got one for the pedestrians and one for the high performance. I'd be willing to bet that the programmers the heavy programming work that you'll really migrate to the really high performance kind of things that otherwise people say that's too hard to learn but you ought to have both. There's a lot of evolution there that's there to go after and I would like to see it get started.<br>\tDid some place did we lose the diagram of the hyperscope? [inaudible 00:25:15] Oh, so it starts with saying okay you got target C Legacy servers so we're saying let's provide linkage into everything we have this kind of knowledge packages not just H10O. The thing is that there's an intermediate server that's one that given this new kind of url to the point to any known legacy document type and it'll transform it into an intermediate file that's [inaudible 00:25:48] Then your browser sits there and can get a picture generated by the view generator as to what sort of a vie you want to see. H transformer will be able to give every paragraph as we learn more and more what kind of objects, [inaudible 00:26:08] solicit kind of tags with algorithms that you can count on so you can have a link now pointing to a given paragraph in a word document or a given something this. </div><br><div>\tNot only that but the links as we had can have view specks in them so that it says this link says go get that document transform it and show me this view starting from that point and highlight it in certain ways. This can start open the door for the kind of flexible capabilities we had for there and it means that you could put this in the middle anomaly of not today's environments or everybody doesn't have to move to this thing. Some people could start using this and have these kind of link and points to the kind of working file that everybody else is using and doesn't have that capability and it's an evolutionary approach. Then there's our link database that keeps track of what links are pointing to what that are using this server. They're very interesting things that that can do. </div><br><div>\tHe says okay you want to be able to link into audio and video at server 2 and movies or a cd rom linked to certain places at the [time 00:27:25] these are the legacy types which we don't have to go into details of something why it says okay how would you like to be able to link into any of those things, the particular things and the link database says okay or every link excise in this environment you know what the target object is, the high resolution location of the link that got you to that target and its home file. The link type designation because the links have syntax that say you can have a link type. </div><br><div>\tAnyway, you'd like to know what that is and for some link types also the content that come with it a comment note and that comment note might actually have another link or so it says hey Fred that's a pretty weighty thing you're talking about I wonder if you've checked with such and so on the link pointing out to there. Part of the viewing that you could look at this with would say in this document I'm looking at are there any links pointing to it. Oh, yeah there's 17. Well I just want to see those from a certain class of people. Okay. Or a certain types. Okay, let me see the comments that might be on them. This would give you a great deal. These are things I've dreamed about for years and we did quite a bit of them. </div><br><div>\tThe value is that they be able to be done with legacy top so as I was getting ready to come over here for the last week or 2 thinking that home what about if there were a growing class of people out there in the world that started to use the hyperscope how much could Google services start doing it that they'd be able to indicate to Google that they're a hyperscope user so could Google start extending its service so that it would give them the explicit location of the passages that incurred the hit that they got and have [inaudible 00:29:32] areas.<br>\tThen the other thing about this high resolution linking is that it would be such good support for the thing that's grown up to be the Argument Structuring, explain this. Does anybody know what that means? Are they just very bashful? Anyway, that-</div><br><div>Male 1:\tYou means the structure of conversation where people pay somebody to come [inaudible 00:30:03]</div><br><div>Doug:\tEvolved or whatever. In my mind that's an absolutely essential part of our future. As a group that doesn't get enough publicity about that isn't working. These are things that I just thinking about pulling together the knowledge that really represents the best understanding for any given situation that that certain going to be a patient. Here's one of them best books about it that's got a whole bunch of connections about describing it. For instance here's a diagram pulled out of it that says okay these are the associates who're doing it but all these different arrows between them are connections that would be tight as likes. That can be pulling out explicit passages from any place to sort of represent in an Argument Structure which would just be extremely valuable for all of that. I'm sure that there are in the software world specialty roles especially capabilities so if you hit it that way in the knowledge world, too. </div><br><div>\tThis is the next thing if you're going to get these network information communities going who are the candidates, our universities, government agencies, professional societies, you got philanthropies, special improvement infrastructures, [inaudible 00:31:59] If ever did get that going and learn how it would be really nice to start showing the philanthropic organizations how the challenges they're trying to go that they could then fund people adding then capabilities, the know how to go after and build the best understanding they can of the situation they're trying to deal with. Then your hit says oh professional societies, too, that's what they're trying to do. Well, universities if you could get around their peer review things [inaudible 00:32:30] government agencies, yeah, have a chance and how about business? This is a special challenge in there about businesses. What I had explained to me that the tech support people don't want to bring in any alien unquote application packages inside their world. It's okay to have browser supported by a server or something. Okay, let's just have the hyperscope give a chance to be in there but how much more about really building DKRs in the machinery unique to doing that?</div><br><div>\tWe did a kick off about finding a couple of university professor that had a chance to apply and get a course that they're trying to work with the undergraduates about this because to my mind they're very flexible citizens in the undergraduates universities that can start doing interesting things. One of them is Valerie Dinn down here who has a class like this at Cal State University so if you want to ask her questions and Jamie Dean works with her. </div><br><div>\tHere's some reference links and this I guess will be posted s you can go look at the kind of things were some of the background on this can be reached. If there are no further questions thank you. It's really kind of a puzzle to me that as I wave my hands and go through some of these things it take quite a while to digest each of the steps we've been through so if there's a discussion I'd welcome it or if you want to ... Yeah.</div><br><div>Male 2:\tYou talked about enabling infrastructure as a kind of leverage a [button 00:34:31] in the knowledge industry example but it seems like we got certain problems that we're already kind of doing that. For example the human [inaudible 00:34:38] project; it's a worldwide effort where different lives are contributing to sequences and now that [inaudible 00:34:45] got people all over the world catching knowledge of that framework in terms of discovering protein structure and things like that. That's mainly a dis-tense of your [inaudible 00:34:54] framework. How would you relate those two like a particular instance towards the view of what we could do?</div><br><div>Doug:\tI feel that we need to do [inaudible 00:35:03] we could research the kind of [inaudible 00:35:07] and say, \"Hey one of the examples [inaudible 00:35:08] is you can [inaudible 00:35:11] how many of them provide what kind of functional advantage and capability. Among those I listed there's still [inaudible 00:35:18] is not supporting the kind of argumentation that said are going and really getting some of them. He says, \"Okay, if somebody starts outfit stared to get better and better understanding how you can actually do this DKR more effectively, what it requires of the community that is using them through the ways of studying it and contributing to it and where do you find the special teams that can probably do the high quality integration. It's there to go after and going after that would be terrific because the better here's big problems they'd be able to go better with that. </div><br><div>\tGetting the best examples you can and then just like in the programming they did for a while of how do you judge what it had with the capability level, how do you judge the capability level with dynamic knowledge repository development of a given community. It would be very handy to start getting measures of that which is almost like saying, \"Hey, what's your relative IQ?\" That's my dream. Yes.</div><br><div>Male 3:\tGive your slide on [guys 00:36:44] making arguments active duty I think about [inaudible 00:36:48] politics. Places where we're having a lot arguments going back and forth from 2 organizations that aren't necessarily looking to share all of their structure and so essentially they collectively for trying to solve the problem of for example for [inaudible 00:37:04] that we have two bodies of knowledge or more than that. Due to particularly globalized knowledge but the 2 communities are probably not willing to share all of their knowledge of all of their interface of their knowledge with each other or with someone else. I'm wondering if there's any sort of way of or wondering if it's worth thinking about a [inaudible 00:37:34] particular or means for I guess for sharing or gently working out what you're not willing to essentially completely expose everything in your knowledge base.</div><br><div>Doug:\tThat's exactly the kind of thing that I think, \"Oh, boy, if we really got that going.\" A lot of people educated in our society about what make a really going on DKR. You could use it in your businesses and all of that. He says, \"Okay, our society really, really better built good DKRs that are equivalent to the news services, what's really happening? Then you say I need to know more and more about what's going on in our government in order to facilitate the democracy because now all the vestibules vote for somebody then what kind of picture you're given by the time it gets twisted in the different kind of releases and such as that because you have a very, very hard job to make a decision based upon what would be the best for the country in this situation or something. That's part of what I feel if we don't as a culture develop this capability of getting lot more effective with our collective IQ we'll be spiraling into no man's land. It's really important and that's what keeps me stumbling along is [inaudible 00:39:01]</div><br><div>Male 4:\tI guess what I'm  a little concerned that as we build better [inaudible 00:39:07] dealing with all your pioneer classes and evaluation that [inaudible 00:39:16] I feel we just take that and then go form complicated system rather than spending efforts to make simple systems and the extremist say, \"Ah, now that I see plus, plus [inaudible 00:39:27] to its complexity because some people feel that [inaudible 00:39:33] some people like that and deal with that program that there's hat much less bran power left to deal with the actual problem we have. Are we that slighted here over the last few decades? Are we making progress?</div><br><div>Doug:\tThat's the kind of thing we got to get smarter at, assessing. How do you get to understand what the situation is? I hate to keep using that as the thing but almost every significant issue you talk about how are you going to educate people better while there's so much more to learn, so much more pressure. Well, should we break them up into specialist very early or what? How many of our citizens have to know how to read to know how to analyze to know how to check an argument out to see if okay, etc. how much trust do they need to have in the people who are doing it in their behalf like how much trust do you have on the accountants here that can tell you what he overhead figures are. Lot of people in here probably couldn't go looking at the books and derive it so you depend upon these certified people that are accountant. The probably certified magicians that can go through the argument structures and they ought to be open so anybody can go through and check them. <br>\t<br>\tTo me it's just not something that would be nice that would add profit to the companies. It's something that if we don't learn how to do that in a very significantly, effective way I just don't see that there's the slightest thing that guarantees our continued survival. I got this picture I wish I had a cartoonist that could do it, great big lumbering vehicle got wheels all over the place, lots of compartments in it with different kinds of people living in them. It goes lumbering over rougher and rougher ground and the ground is getting rougher and it's moving faster and the headlights won't shine far enough ahead and besides no one can be quite sure who's steering it or how. You say what's the chances that vehicle is not going to just go crash? It's going oh so it propel faster. I just grow more and more sure not very happy about it but more and more sure that that's the situation. Anybody want a cheerier?</div><br><div>Male 5:\tKind of a comment on that. Why did the intelligence that we've used to get here bee enough to help us to just going forward? Why would you think we need this? I think more and more increasing in others that just creates more and more complicated processing [than this 00:42:32]<br>Doug:\tLots of intelligence is at working out through all over in accepted cultural frameworks that don't necessarily say we're collaborating. I guess talk about it you know the kind of things that if you're a rabid liberal, is not the term now a liberal? You say, \"Hey how come our national debt went up so high in just 4 years and we have people taking care of it and such?\" Well, yeah but how come? What does that mean? They're thinking about PayPal just slightly older than you they're going to start being able to retire and simply it won't be enough money for their Social Security. How'd that happen? Whom did we depend upon? Why wasn't that we're something we're all aware of? Where would we go look to see what the certified logical knowledge about it would be. </div><br><div>\tIf you don't want to be that global about it just think about if you could do it inside the given kind of project domains you are how 10 people could get it together a lot better to understand what it is the project is. What opportunities, possibilities has etc. </div><br><div>Male 6:\tYour model for the DKRs combining to form larger DKRs is there kind of an implicit assumption that people who are contributing knowledge are being correct and honest or is there some concept of weighting these things by authority or going by reputation or some mechanism to ensure that when you're looking at the large scale picture you're actually getting reliable information rather than just what somebody had [inaudible 00:44:35]</div><br><div>Doug:\t[inaudible 00:44:36] evaluating structure things are that anybody can contest it and point to something and say I contest that because of this or that. As long as they're sort of open contest like that to say there's a question about whether or not this assertion is valid. That can be open so where dad you get the data, etc. to tie it down to get in finally finding second but it isn't done that way now. People can make assertions that we just have to trust them and oh yeah today's world with ... Anyway. </div><br><div>\tUnless we do that it's sort of like adding up the arithmetic or adding up the accounting system to see that it adds up and somebody's been filing false expense claims that could throw everything off until you find out something wrong so it must be old. [inaudible 00:45:38] One of the things I would be interested in sort of with people with the k skill and talent in here about having some more discussion at that hyperscope idea and getting it tried, getting going. Another time if I get this dear old system we call Augment we got the money from [DARPA 00:46:05] 8 years ago that we're going to rewrite that in small talk and visual works. All we Dianne McIntyre. At the client server thing so the client was out for the minimal local computation for power you can imagine it was usable in the 70s and it could work over more bandwidth than the 9600 volt [modem 00:46:31] but it's so worked very nicely; everything was done in the server and serve said what the change on the screen and we got all the information. </div><br><div>\tWe need a new client that work through the internet and just had lots of flexibility to have any number of windows open at once but that were all under the control of one kind of thing they weren't that many different applications running or different images of one application. They were one application controlling them all so you could copy and move things between them etc. you have one for viewing something in one way. I want to jump to that but in this window say jump there and move to the other window and whatever you views speckling there we'd hope bingo, that's what you'd see. Many, many flexibilities so that provide a way in which we could actually demonstrate some of those things. </div><br><div>\tThree months ago the connections suddenly stopped working over the internet and we're trying to find people that can resolve it for us and figure out why [inaudible 00:47:36] so it'd be really a real examples of the kinds of  things I was thinking about and telling you about earlier. I was a professor for a while and I figured I can tell when I've put them to sleep. </div><br><div>Male 7:\t[inaudible 00:48:05] I'm trying to see your [inaudible 00:48:07] the dancing with the web thing is it like a extended version of the existing web or is it flexing on some of web where having one of these sources plugs into it or [crosstalk 00:48:18] </div><br><div>Doug:\tHttp kind of thing and still be able to go get documents. When I got them it would bring them into the intermediary server and transform them and then you're viewing and dealing with transformers. Later on you'd start saying well let me just start editing that xml kind of document and store it and I've got an application growing that can grow to be my open hyperdocument system but as the first stages of this hyperscope it just means that now the link you formed can actually look into directly right into any of these other document forms and into a particular spot in them. Give the viewing and the manipulation etc. which would increase the capability of that user a lot to study and move around, find things. It would be increasing in an interesting way the kind of service Google cold offer that class of user. Do you need something more specific?</div><br><div>Male 7:\tWell, [inaudible 00:49:26] replace it with [inaudible 00:50:20]</div><br><div>Doug:\tI think would it replace it completely in edging; can it just be an added feature? [crosstalk 00:50:27]</div><br><div>Male 7:\t[inaudible 00:50:29] </div><br><div>Female 2:\tDoug, [inaudible 00:51:21] one of the many things that he's talking about is [inaudible 00:51:28] base and imagine if [inaudible 00:51:33] the users had actually been given [inaudible 00:51:35] in their old system actually tracked your passage and those that they miscommunication on a database say Google. This is my actually hypotheses about how his stuff could translate to relate Google is that you could actually have sit for hyperobjects in which you could actually specify the main types or view types as well as the normal search so that was just one potential extension of [perks 00:52:05]</div><br><div>Male 8:\tI guess from the hyperscope [inaudible 00:52:10] applying this sort of this schematics or [inaudible 00:52:14] for schematics to a set of documents [inaudible 00:52:18] that versus [inaudible 00:52:25] in those documents correcting them. There's all this I guess work to create a schematic [look 00:52:35] where you've essentially more directly describe what certain things on certain pages means and you can do all sort of new things with this new information you have [invested 00:52:49] back in the page. How could you proceed like that [inaudible 00:52:54] I thought you were describing a hyperscope? I thought you were describing what a hyperscope could provide.</div><br><div>[inaudible 00:53:05] side of the schematics are implied by sort of this external [inaudible 00:53:14] kind of this main structure of this [inaudible 00:53:16] and so on. There's this having not and all the information [inaudible 00:53:25] </div><br><div>\tAs people evolved their document that they're developing and hose that shift into building on the hyperscopes intermediate file structure and start evolving in open hyperdocument system at every stage it would be interoperable with the legacy stuff but it could start having more richer metadata and things. It's like we improving something very interesting in ours that every node other it would be roughly a paragraph or a line of code or something it had a property that who was the last person that edited it within and boy if that didn't come into interesting things when you get new bugs showing up in the system. Implicit linking. Came out of that very nicely and the inclusion such ... It was just a very rich thing ... It's sort of a showing that giving you the feeling of possibility. It's not saying that that was the answer but it want an example of a much richer environment and the kind that if we don't go after a richer environment we're short circuiting ourselves, shortchanging ourselves [inaudible 00:54:52]</div><br><div>\t[inaudible 00:54:55] the car moving forward sounds like a lesson in control and like the best [inaudible 00:55:06] book is those ideas that are coming into [flight 00:55:08] somehow to communicate with your fellow humans on a way it doesn't make you seem like [inaudible 00:55:14] so that you lose your credibility and basically you gain some [inaudible 00:55:20]</div><br><div>\tWhat'd you do about it? You can say, \"Well, maybe I have to adjust so I don't see my cocoon\" but if you want that community to be more effective and effective it just become very important that their education level kind of grows until the concepts that they have to deal with they have a good enough metadata with enough vocabulary. If what we're trying to talk about is really improving our collective ability we just have to be collectively improving the scopes of our vocabulary. A loan officer of these concepts I've evolve and I'm not sure I evolved them before the first examples of implementation but I really know that with the system we had we built so we could set the profile for a person when they started at a very limited vocabulary, now it's [worse 00:56:40] just like in [inaudible 00:56:42] find and make it start adding more when they want it to. Once they have that freedom it was very secure but you'd be surprised at how rapidly someone would say, \"I want more, I want ...\" Then the invasive learning was much higher than it would be if you're there to have to drill everybody to say it's time for you to boost your vocabulary. <br>\t<br>Speaker 1:\t[inaudible 00:57:11] give Doug Engelbart [inaudible 00:57:11] thanks for ...</div>",

Engelbart<br>Bootstrap Institute<br>(AUGMENT,133319,)</div><br><div>The complexity and urgency of the problems faced by us earth-bound humans are increasing much faster than are our aggregate capabilities for understanding and coping with them. This is a very serious problem; and there are strategic actions we can take, collectively.</div><br><div>Consider a community's \"Collective IQ\" to represent its capability for dealing with complex, urgent problems-i.e., to understand them adequately, to unearth the best candidate solutions, to assess resources and operational capabilities and select appropriate solution commitments, to be effective in organizing and executing the selected approach, to monitor the progress and be able to adjust rapidly and appropriately to unforeseen complications, etc.</div><br><div>I contend that a strategy for \"facilitating the evolution\" of our organizations' Collective IQs will be the optimum approach. Hypertext will be of basic importance, and SIGWeb ought to be a leader.</div><br><div>\"Collective IQ\" is a special set of collective capabilities, built upon our basic human capabilities, such as sensory, perceptual, cognitive, motor, etc. Any significant collective capability is achieved by \"augmenting\" such basic human capabilities by means of training, enculturation, etc. in operational use of: (a) appropriately coordinated systems of artifacts and tools (the \"Tool System\"); and (b) vocabulary, conventions, roles, organizational structues, rules of conduct, methods of cooperation and education, etc. (the \"Human System\"). Together the Tool and Human Systems comprise the \"Augmentation System.\"</div><br><div>My hypothesis is that ever-more effective \"Dynamic Knowledge Repositories\" (DKRs) will be central to improving a community's Collective IQ-essentially the capability, in dealing with a complex problem, for providing the best, up-to-date understanding of the current state of both the problem and of its solution efforts. Specially trained teams will be involved for instance, to ingest the ongoing dialog, help in adapting to the relevant ontological shifts, help monitor and solidify the \"argument structures\" involved in seeking coherence and plausibility, etc. And also for providing correctly associated \"views\" of the knowledge structure to facilitate learning-probably different such viewing forms for different categories of learners.</div><br><div>Consider an \"Improvement Community\" (IC) as collectively engaged in improving an agreed-upon set either of individual capabilities, or of collective group capabilities-e.g. a professional society. Let's introduce a new category, a \"Networked Improvement Community\" (NIC): an IC that is consciously and effectively employing best-possible DKR development and usage.</div><br><div>To be strategically prepared, we have formed the Bootstrap Alliance, to be a \"Meta NIC\", or NIC of NICs, for collectively improving its NIC-member capabilities to in turn each improve its particular capability-improvement activities.</div><br><div>So we should encourage the launching of a first NIC, and feel quite strongly that the best strategic formulation for it's capability-improvement focus would be improvement of DKR development and utilization.</div><br><div>There are many sub-configurations of a community's augmentation system for which provocative improvement possibilities will arise. The proposed evolution-facilitation strategy would be to provide the best possible \"frontier map\" of what is happening within the various out-front organizations employing their various approaches to increase their CIQ capability. A mutually supported \"CIQ-Frontier DKR\" would provide every organization with the best view of what's happening on the frontier, enabling each to make its own decision as to which direction it should next move in its survival quest of increased CIQ.</div><br><div>This same \"frontier-mapping DKR\" strategy would also facilitate progress in any other NIC-based collective-improvement process.</div><br><div>In my years wrestling with this Facilitated-Evolution Strategy, there have emerged many candidate Tool- and Human-System innovations about which I hope to have continuing dialog with parties interested in considering this strategic approach. For instance, colleagues and I have very interesting things going in trial undergraduate university classes-exciting results, and a candidate \"Education NIC\" (EDNIC).</div>",
