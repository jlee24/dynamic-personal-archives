Engelbart<br><br>SUBJECT: Possibilities for Teaching Machine Activity at SRI<br><br>1. My Background and Relevant Interests<br><br>My professional background is in the digital computer field as an engineer concerned with internal organization of computers and with the development of basic new physical techniques for their construction. My professional motivations are strongly oriented toward maximizing the benefit which society might derive from the advancements in the computer field. I might say then that my professional interests are toward the application of automatic information-handling equipment for helping human society, in the most significant way possible.<br><br>I hope to help build up a program aimed at the very basic goal of developing techniques such that an intelligent person and a powerful computer can work directly together as an extremely capable team, in the sort of intellectual activity domain that most professional men spend their working days. I also hope to see facilities and techniques developed at SRI for more direct and more extensive utilization of computers in experimental research, particularly in the social sciences. It seems that realtime monitoring, evaluating, and complexly programmed controlling of experiments involving physiological, <b>psychological</b>, intellectual, and/or <b>sociological</b> dynamics of animals or humans could be made available to many different types of research by a common core of computer and terminal equipment.<br><br>The two program hopes that are mentioned above overlap very nicely, and one activity area which is relevant to both is research on learning <b>theory</b> and <b>teaching</b> <b>machines</b>. I would very much like to see SRI become engaged in this latter activity, and would hope that it could be done in conjunction with general socialscience computeraided experimentation, as well as with an \"intelligent team\" research program.<br><br>2. </div><div id='full_0'><mark>General Thoughts on Teaching Machine Activity at SRI<br><br>I think that, in general, SRI is just the type of institution to play a significant role in the development of <b>teaching</b> machine techniques.</mark></div><div> Our notforprofit research nature puts us nicely between the academic <b>educational</b> psychology researchers, the industrial machine developers and builders, the industrial, <b>educational</b>, and military users, and the governmental and philanthropic foundation research sponsors. We have the capability to develop special equipment for experimentation, we can plan and conduct research on <b>theory</b> and application of automated <b>teaching</b>, we can take on \"system\" studies for potential users, we can develop equipment specifications for a user, see that he gets good bids and equipment, and oversee installation and early utilization. It would seem that only another institution such as ours could play a more effective role in getting <b>teaching</b> machine techniques developed and into practice.<br><br>3. </div><div id='full_4'><mark>My Contacts in the Teaching Machine Field<br><br>a. Dr. Bert Kersh, Systems Development Corporation.</mark></div><div> An <b>educational</b> psychologist by training and experience, he first got me interested in this area several years ago when he was at the University of Oregon. He is still quite interested in the area, but is now doing other things. </div><div id='full_3'><mark>Is interested in coming to SRI sometime in the future would probably be interested in participating in <b>teaching</b> machine work and has explicitly stated that he is interested in the intelligent machine area.</mark></div><div><br><br></div><div id='full_1'><mark>b. Dr. Robert Mager, Research Scientist, U. S. Army Air Defense Human Research Unit, Fort Bliss, Texas.</mark></div><div> A psychologist engaged in an active program in the <b>teaching</b> machine area.<br><br>c. Dr. Edward Herold, Vice President, in charge of research, Varian Associates. I met him at the same time as Mager, who was visiting Varian. </div><div id='full_2'><mark>Herold is very much interested in <b>teaching</b> <b>machines</b>, had encouraged thinking about it at RCA when he was there, and is apparently getting activity going at Varian now.</mark></div><div> He thought SRI could do very well to get going in this area (this was last Fall).<br><br>4. Recommendations for SRI.<br><br>I think we should definitely make plans to get into this area. We should do it gently enough that we are well oriented and so that we can apply our talents effectively. Probably the possibilities that Kincaid and Sorenson are exploring now, active field work with educators, would make a verygood start. With some activity going on, we should be able to focus more realistically upon the needs and possibilities for contribution.<br><br>I would hope that the computer-oriented activities in the Engineering Division can mature in the directions outlined in Part 1 of this memo, so that eventually there can develop some well-coordinated experimental facilities. In any event, I think that the <b>psychological</b>, the <b>sociological</b>, and the \"systems engineering\" aspects of this can all flourish within SRI, and should present a coordinated structure to the outside world. We should look to this coordination early.<br><br>As I said in Part 2, I think that SRI is admirably suited to contribute very effectively in the development of the <b>machines</b> and the techniques for using them (including practical and thoughtful guidance of development and application). I think that we should plan on being a significant force in this area and move into it with that in mind.<br><br>D. C. Engelbart</div>",

C.<br><br>1. PRECIS<br><br>a. Project Title: The Augmented Human Intellect: Search for a Framework<br>b. Organization:\t Stanford Re<b>search</b> Institute, Menlo Park, California<br>c. Principal Investigator: Douglas C. Engelbart<br><br>d. Brief: Stanford Re<b>search</b> Institute has committed itself to the internal support of a <b>preprogram</b> study in a previously undefined area that can be identified generally as \"giving overall attention to the <b>individual</b> human as an effective <b><b>problem</b>solving</b> agent.\" In this proposal the Institute solicits joint support from the AFOSR for this studynaming a sum corresponding to half the effort that the Institute has planned for the forthcoming year. The vocabulary doesn't seem to exist with which to communicate briefly the subject range involved in this multidisciplinary study. The best summary of the proposed re<b>search</b> would seem to be a statement that we are going to try to determine what the range of subject matter must be within which to give rational, overall consideration to the <b>problem</b> of making humans more effective as <b>problem</b> solvers, and to try to provide perspective for a coordinated attack upon this <b>problem</b>.<br><br><br>2. </div><div id='full_4'><mark>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br><br>The objective of this study is to establish a conceptual <b>framework</b> within which could grow a coordinated re<b>search</b> and development program whose goals would be the following: (1) to find the factors that limit the effectiveness of the human <b>individual</b>'s basic <b>informationhandling</b> capabilities in meeting the various needs of society for <b>problem</b> solving in its most general sense; and (2) to develop new <b>techniques</b>, procedures, or systems that will better match these basic capabilities to the needs or <b>problem</b>s of society.</mark></div><div><br><br><br>3. APPROACH<br><br>This will be a paper study, done principally by one Senior Re<b>search</b> Engineer and one Re<b>search</b> Assistant. Although most of the work will involve literature <b>search</b> and study, plans exist for extended discussions with <b>personnel</b> in other disciplines, and for several <b>interdisciplinary</b> seminars at SRI and Stanford University. It is expected that several crosscountry trips will be taken during the year to make possible personal discussion with people that our literature <b>search</b>, local discussions, and correspondence have \"discovered.\"<br><br>To stimulate interest, criticism, and useful acquaintanceships, we plan to publish material before different relevant readerships. We recently presented a paper at the 1960 Annual Meeting of the American Documentation Institute, Berkeley, California, October 2327, (entitled \"Special Considerations of the Individual as a User, Generator, and Retriever of Information\"). We also hope to present a more general and comprehensive paper at the 1961 Western Joint Computer Conference in Los Angeles next Maywhere the theme of the conference is, \"Extending Man's Intellect.\"<br><br>The two questions whose answers represent the goal of the prospective program decompose into a host of subsidiary questions. Many of the meatiest of these will have to be dealt with later by people with appropriate backgrounds and within projects having sensibly specialized objectives. Many other questions, however, should be pursued before the rest can be ordered into a reasonable hierarchy of succession, relevance, and project or team areas This hierarchy of questions will grow as part of a maturing conceptual <b>framework</b>. It will be the job of this proposed study to ferret out as many meaningful questions as possible, and to deal with those that are necessary for the construction of the <b>framework</b> and its included hierarchy of re<b>search</b> questions.<br><br>Here are a few typical questions of the hundreds we want to answer:<br><br>Has anyone or any discipline ever given serious consideration to the <b>individual</b> in a way similar to ours? Why has such consideration not been givenif not? Is this an unmanageable enterprise? (To a people shooting for the moon?) What do the psychologists who specialize in <b><b>problem</b>solving</b> theory have to offer us? What value might there be in developing ways for a human to receive or transmit encoded information that are different from our conventional methodse.g., is \"tactile literacy\" promising to us? What about formal decision theory? Can \"time and motion\" <b>techniques</b> be borrowed usefully from the industrial engineer for analysis and synthesis of effective intellectual procedure? How soon could we begin making use of what the psychologists working on \"concept attributes are learning? Are the motivations and objectives of people working in that field likely to induce them naturally to pursue the type of understanding that we would find most useful within that field; or does it look as if specially directed re<b>search</b> would have to be stimulated somewhere if our prospective program were to want direct help from this field? Are the practical limitations that block those who propose dynamic usage of formal logical languages (e.g., Rudolph Carnap) something that could be overcome if we gave the <b>individual</b> a little automatic aid in his formal manipulation of the symbology? How much of the approach taken by the \"intelligent machine\" re<b>search</b>er is adaptable advantageously to a dynamically cooperative manmachine \"intelligent team?\"<br><br>For further details of our method of approach, see Exhibit A, a copy of a recent internal SRI memo which gives a fairly detailed picture of current activity on this study.<br><br> <br>4. BACKGROUND AND HISTORY<br><br>A reasonable representation of the background of work that has already been done at Stanford Re<b>search</b> Institute is provided in Exhibit A. As far as is known, no work has been done elsewhere that pursues similar overall objectives, although there are a great many contributions by others that will prove highly relevant to various aspects of our study.<br><br>The principal investigator has wanted to pursue this study for many yearsand, in fact, can say that the possibilities to be explored here are essentially identical to those that motivated him to quit the job he held in 1951 and enter graduate school to specialize in digital computers. His choice of Stanford Re<b>search</b> Institute as a place to work was largely based upon the appropriate vehicle it represented for initiating a program such as is projected here. There was thus a reasonably extensive bibliographic and conceptual structure already in existence when the Institute first authorized parttime effort in this area early in 1959.<br><br><br>5. STATEMENT OF WORK<br><br>We shall browse, <b>search</b>, sift, analyze, evaluate, hypothesize, and integrate, in cyclic fashion, through a large collection of facts, concepts, and considerations gleaned from personal discussions and from the literature. This will be our main activity, and our work will be of three concurrent kinds. First, we shall be engrossed in the abovementioned cyclic journeys through the subject information. Second, we shall stand aside from time to time to engage in introspection regarding the way we are handling our <b>problem</b>s, and to try designing relatively simple <b>techniques</b> and procedures for us to use to increase our effectiveness it may actually make us more effective, and it probably will help our orientation to today's reality. Third, we shall construct messages to communicate to the outside world. At least one reasonably comprehensive paper is planned, and more will be considered. Then we plan to prepare a report, probably coinciding with the AFOSR <b>contract</b> anniversary (if a <b>contract</b> is forthcoming) J that provides a summary of our <b>search</b> results. We hope to be able to provide by that time a reasonably comprehensive treatment of (a) an analysis of the factors involved in matching a human's basic capabilities to society's <b>problem</b>s, (b) an analysis and evaluation of the various areas where improved matching seems possible, and (c) some definite recommendations for re<b>search</b>. We hope that this report can be significant enough to warrant publication in some form that could carry overall perspective to people who might be stimulated toward accepting some of the challenges which we expect to provide.<br><br><br>6. ACCEPTANCE PERIOD<br><br>This proposal will remain in effect until 28 February 1961. If consideration of the proposal requires a longer period, the Institute would be glad to consider a request for an extension in time.<br><br><br>7. ESTIMATED TIME AND CHARGES<br><br>The <b>estimated</b> time required to complete this project and report its results is twelve (12) months. The Institute could begin work within one month after receipt of an executed <b>contract</b>. The <b>estimated</b> maximum charges for this project are $26,924. A cost breakdown is included in Sec. 10 of this proposal.<br><br><br>8. CONTRACT FORM<br><br>It is requested that any <b>contract</b> resulting from this proposal be awarded under Basic Agreement AF 33(600)7374 between the United States Air Force and Stanford Re<b>search</b> Institute.<br><br><br>9.

C. Engelbart<br><br>Subj: Current Status of Internally Supported Work on the Augmented Human Intellect \"Snapshot\" View to Supplement Previous Memos and to Update Specific Project Aspects<br><br> <br>This memorandum is intended to present a description of the objectives, motivation, basic thinking, and general method of approach for a current, internally sponsored <b>preprogram</b> <b>search</b> activity at Stanford Re<b>search</b> Institute. The purpose of this activity is to explore the possibilities for initiating a coordinated re<b>search</b> and development program aimed at the following objectives: (1) to find the factors which limit the effectiveness of the human <b>individual</b>'s basic <b>informationhandling</b> capabilities in meeting the various needs of society for <b>problem</b> solving in its most general sense; and (2) to develop new <b>techniques</b>, procedures, or systems which will better match these basic capabilities to the society (or, to its <b>problem</b>s). A more detailed picture of these objectives and their implications should emerge from reading the rest of the memorandum.<br><br>It is expected that this program which is being \"designed\" (and which we call Program A) will give balanced consideration to longrange re<b>search</b>, for the <b>individual</b> of the 1970's, as well as to shorterrange re<b>search</b> and development, for the <b>individual</b> of the 1960's. On the one hand, there are very sophisticated possibilities for the highly trained and highly automated <b>individual</b> (for special situations in this decade, or more general use in the next), which can allow the <b>individual</b> effectively to assimilate, organize, manipulate and analyze information relevant to a complex <b>problem</b> with a capability that would leave the genius of today still sharpening his pencils at the starting line. On the other hand, there seems to be a good chance that relatively primitive measures could soon be developed to increase the effectiveness of the <b>individual</b> in today's real worldhelp him to make use of more information, to handle routine things more quickly, to organize and integrate more complex <b>problem</b>s, to cooperate more effectively in a dynamic way with other humans in tackling a <b>problem</b>, etc.<br><br>ABOUT A FRAMEWORK FOR R&D, AND THE SEARCH PROCESS<br><br>A very stimulating report, written at RAND by Kennedy and Putt in 1956 [1], provides a good picture of the need in a re<b>search</b> program for a suitable <b>framework</b> within which re<b>search</b>ers are oriented and by which administrators and re<b>search</b>ers, and re<b>search</b>ers and developers, can interact. It is pointed out that every established discipline has such a <b>framework</b> built into it, and that every re<b>search</b>er who has passed through the formal training of that discipline views the world, is interested in certain types of information, approaches <b>problem</b>s with certain methodology, and has preferred ways of presenting results according to the <b>framework</b> which his discipline has developed. It seems that, in <b>interdisciplinary</b> re<b>search</b> programs, the establishment of a <b>framework</b> within which the re<b>search</b> for a given program may take place is something which should be given more recognition as a vital and difficult task. A meaningful difference is thus made clear between the \"<b>search</b>\" for a structure, and the subsequent re<b>search</b> within that structure. Some excerpts from the report will, I think, have value here:<br><br>\"In the early days of science, when the men who contributed were generalists and natural <b>philosophers</b>, they were unhampered by the accumulated culture of science. They built their own <b>framework</b>s for understanding the world. They were primarily engaged in '<b>search</b>' as opposed to re<b>search</b>. They developed ways of discovering how to think about <b>problem</b>s as opposed to getting answers to questions posed within an established or traditional <b>framework</b>. Searching appears to be the traditional function of the philosopher. </div><div id='full_1'><mark>With the sharp line drawn in modern times between philosophy and science, <b>search</b>ing for the better <b>framework</b> in science seems to be confined to the very few <b>philosophers</b> of science and technologythe many do the re<b>search</b> ... A basic <b>problem</b> for administering <b>interdisciplinary</b> re<b>search</b> is how to induce the members of the team to indulge in <b>search</b> for the adequate <b>framework</b> rather than re<b>search</b>.</mark></div><div> A <b>framework</b> is needed within which to integrate the answers on the different components of a <b>problem</b>. How to choose a <b>framework</b> that is suitable for all of the different specialists involved is a real <b>problem</b>. Many a specialist feels, in a <b>framework</b> made by another, that his particular contribution is all distorted or unrecognizable. Frameworks are most difficult to communicate because one quickly runs into fundamental philosophical and cultural issues.<br><br>\"..... The first conviction of the re<b>search</b> specialist is that a <b>problem</b> can be factored in such a way that his particular specialty is the only important aspect.... The re<b>search</b> specialists, like all other living organisms, will go to great lengths to maintain a comfortable position. Having invested much time and energy to become specialists in a given methodology, they can be expected to resist efforts to expand the boundaries of the methodology or to warp the methodology in an unfamiliar <b>framework</b>.<br><br>\" The fact that <b>individual</b> contributions tend to be distorted or to disappear in a larger <b>framework</b> also is an unsolved <b>problem</b> for the administrator. Our re<b>search</b> culture is based upon rewards to the <b>individual</b> not to the team. The perceptive re<b>search</b> specialist knows this perfectly well: hence the <b>interdisciplinary</b> team is unstable, on at least two counts the sweat, blood and tears of trying to resolve conflicting values, and the <b>problem</b> of reward to <b>individual</b> members. The appropriate expectation for <b>interdisciplinary</b> teams appears to be that they will be unstable associations. But <b>interdisciplinary</b> re<b>search</b> and <b>search</b> behavior is very significant. Re<b>search</b> can be done by the <b>individual</b>, once the farmework has been established, although a certain large <b>problem</b> will require continued close cooperation during the re<b>search</b> and development phases.<br><br>\" When an <b>interdisciplinary</b> re<b>search</b> team sets out first on its <b>problem</b>, it may spend a good deal of time setting out to observe complex phenomena in ways that would lead to a scientific <b>framework</b> in which to work. Observations carried out in a laboratory can be made for the purpose of establishing a <b>framework</b> which now makes possible decisions regarding what re<b>search</b> should be conducted and how it should be conducted. A serious <b>problem</b> here is that the team may be apparently unproductive for a long time. Unless it is completely understood that <b>search</b> rather than re<b>search</b> is going on, observers might tend to apply inappropriate criteria to this work. Much of the <b>search</b>ing is not publishable in standard re<b>search</b> journals, nor is it of great interest to those not engaged in the process. It is tentative, rapidly changing, full of sudden insights and long fallow periods, unpredictable, and unpopular with colleagues engaged in exploiting more traditional <b>framework</b>s by more traditional <b>techniques</b>. But <b>search</b> is the lifeblood of the re<b>search</b> corporation because new tools come from new <b>framework</b>s. Specifically, the new tools for the solution of new complex systems <b>problem</b>s will come from the <b>search</b>ing of <b>interdisciplinary</b> teams if we can find a way to stimulate and reinforce the team concept.\"<br><br>The considerations raised by Kennedy and Putt are relevant here from two points of view. First, the program which we consider initiating is most definitely of the multidisciplinary sort, and their wellstated case for an adequate <b>search</b> phase preceding such a re<b>search</b> program is a very welcome reinforcement to our determination to provide such a phase. One of the reasons that the <b>search</b> to date has gone on under Institute sponsorship is that the early attempts to write proposals for support of what needed doing (the <b>search</b>ing) tried to tie down the <b>problem</b> within the usual \"re<b>search</b> project\" package. It proved to be too difficult (for me) to do so, and it was decided that the Institute would support a modest <b>preprogram</b> survey activity (now called \"<b>search</b>ing\") from which could stem a series of proposals for explicit re<b>search</b> projects that would be integrated as well as possible toward pursuit of the program goals.<br><br>A second feature of the KennedyPutt report which is of relevance to us is that the technique which they reported upon to \"...stimulate and reinforce the team concept.\" is among the kinds of things which our program would like to develop in the futureand, indeed, some of the possibilities we anticipate pursuing, for <b>individual</b>s and small groups, would promise real improvements in the ability of <b>individual</b>s to work together.<br><br> <br>HOW OUR FRAMEWORK SEEMS TO BE DEVELOPING<br><br>Our motivation for focusing upon the <b>individual</b> stems from considering his inherent basic position in any society. No matter what social organization we wish to consider, the real source of its ability to adapt to a changing environment, to recognize and solve its <b>problem</b>s, and to mature in a rational fashion, lies in the abilities of the <b>individual</b>s who compose that organization; progress results from the abilities of a very few. Upon the effectiveness of this type of <b>individual</b> (I call him a \"<b>problem</b>-solving <b>individual</b>\" for want of a better term) depends the stability and progress of our society. In today's world, this stability and progress are threatened with <b>problem</b>s whose complexity and urgency surpass any in our history; our dependence upon the capability of our <b><b>problem</b>solving</b> <b>individual</b>s to handle complex <b>problem</b>s seems overdue for some critical social concern.<br><br>Let us take a brief and basic look at the <b>problem</b> of \"doing something to improve the capability of the <b><b>problem</b>solving</b> <b>individual</b>.\" The following model, though grossly simplified, seems to serve well the need for perspective:<br><br>What really runs our society is the central nervous system of each of its <b>individual</b>s; this system can receive information from the environment through peripheral sensory systems, and can utilize its peripheral motor systems to communicate to the outside world. As far as seems to be demonstrable, the only way an <b>individual</b> human affects his environment in an active sense is by means of the communications sent out by his central nervous system. </div><div id='full_2'><mark>The <b>problem</b> of increasing the effectiveness of an <b>individual</b> human as a <b>problem</b> solver seems thus reducible to the <b>problem</b> of improving the match between the inherent capabilities of the central nervous system and <b>problem</b>s and environments to be faced.</mark></div><div><br><br>The inherent capabilities of which we speak are such as the following: memory, pattern recognition, abstraction, visualization, induction, deduction, intuition, judgment, originality, etc. (the list is not presented as being complete or uniform). There are some very complex codeconversion capabilities associated with the peripheral systems, too. There are also some characteristics involving emotions, motivations, irrationalities and the like which cannot be ignored even though there seems no way to take them into account in our initial model.<br><br>These basic capabilities must be coupled to the <b>problem</b>sthis we have stated as being basic. What sort of things might we be talking about, then, that make up a means for coupling these capabilities to \"those <b>problem</b>s?\" Well, language is a good example. It provides us the means for abstracting basic concepts, symbolizing them, and synthesizing representations of more complex concepts in communicable vocal symbols. Techniques of graphic representation of these symbols allow us to develop the procedures for recording our thoughts and for more complex concept manipulation than our minds could otherwise accomodate. There are a great many <b>techniques</b> and procedures which have been developed for us to use so that our basic capabilities can more effectively be matched to the worldour ballpoint pens, our desks and filing cabinets, our office duplicating equipment, our telephones, all offer us procedures that help, and our <b>techniques</b> of organizing our work so that we decompose the big <b>problem</b>s into little <b>problem</b>s whose solutions our minds can encompass is cleverly adapted to the formal procedures which our different disciplines have developed. The early part of our \"<b>search</b>\" activity seems to be quite involved in gaining an understanding and a perspective of the means that have been developed in the past for matching our central nervous systems to the <b>problem</b>s we face.<br><br> <br><br>5<br><br>We can observe at the outset, however, that the means developed in the past have settled upon the general procedure of separating the symbolicmanipulation activities of the <b>individual</b> into two domainsone internal and the other external. The external domain of activity mostly involves graphic representation of symbols, and serves principally to bolster the internal capabilities of memory and visualization. These two domains form a system which represents to the rest of the world the activity of an <b>individual</b> human. Communications exchanged between this system and the outside world in effect provide the only means by which the given <b>individual</b> influences that world. If <b>individual</b>s are organized into a team, it is usually an organization among separate <b>twodomain</b> systems that is set up.<br><br>In the long run, we can expect to consider extensive changes in <b>techniques</b> and procedures used in both of the symbolmanipulation domains associated with the <b>individual</b>. In the internal domain this will involve changing languages, symbology, modes of abstraction, and the like, and will usually be made practical by (and thus must be coordinated with) changes in the external domain. We can expect these changes to be slower in coming than those which affect mostly the external domain.<br><br>There should be many improved <b>techniques</b> and procedures which can be used in the external domain, and which will demand little basic change in the internal domain or in the world outside the <b>twodomain</b> system. It is principally improvements of this type that will represent the \"near future\" developments of Program A.<br><br><br>HOW OUR PROGRAM SEEMS LIKELY TO DEVELOP<br><br>A number of activities seem to be emerging as possible definite steps toward development of our program. The following list is tentative, but representative.<br><br>1. The Basic Search Process. There will be a continuing need to explore, to examine for relevance, and to integrate into the growing <b>framework</b> new facts, concepts, considerations, etc. There will be a need for coordination of projects and a continual integration of their findings into the <b>framework</b>. It may be that only one person needs to participate full time in this activitythat discussions with other active or interested <b>individual</b>s can provide all of the extra aid neededbut care must be taken that a <b>framework</b> for such a multidisciplinary program is not distorted by too little representation of the different important disciplines involved.<br><br>(It will be noted that this list of possible projects does not include any that are directly aimed at the longrange verybasic <b>problem</b>s, but are mostly aimed at immediate <b>problem</b>s in the external domain or in the intercommunications between the two domains. It will take more <b>search</b> work to determine likely re<b>search</b> relative to longerrange <b>problem</b>sthe <b>problem</b>s have to be isolated a little more clearly, and we need more orientation relative to the knowledge and re<b>search</b> trends in the various disciplines relevant to these <b>problem</b>s.)<br><br><br>2. Observation and Analysis of Typical \"TwoDomain\" Systems of Today. We need to know, in a quantitative and factual manner, just what are the actual <b>techniques</b> and procedures used by the <b><b>problem</b>solving</b> type of <b>individual</b> today, and how they integrate into a system. We should like to have a fairly basic analysis of the different types of tasks that are faced in operating in different typical environments, and we should like to know more about the different sorts of symbolic (information) manipulation which are involved. Analysis of such factors should lead to some realistic assessments of possibilities for making direct improvements in these systems, as well as to a basis upon which to estimate gains in effectiveness which might accrue by future innovations. This type of study should be done by a team (at least three fulltime professionals) that can make use of <b>techniques</b> from humanfactors, analysis, industrial engineering timeandmotion studies, informationprocessingsystems, and other pertinent fields.<br><br>3. Microdocumentation. This concerns, essentially, a documentation system specially designed for the external domain of the <b>individual</b>'s system. Discussion found in my paper, [2] \"Special Considerations of the Individual as a User, Generator, and Retriever of Information,\" provides specific background material.<br><br>There is some question as to how wise it would be to begin a re<b>search</b> activity of this nature before the results of activity under Item 2 were available for guidance. It seems quite certain, however, that systemizing and automating manipulations in the <b>individual</b>'s external domain are bound to be a part of future developments. Getting our feet wet by actually developing special systems of this sort will provide a very useful service of \"keeping us down to earth,\" as well as being a very good check on the perspective and approach being utilized by <b>personnel</b> under Item 2.<br><br>For this project, I would suggest a nucleus of three or four people who can incorporate system thinking, classification <b>techniques</b>, graphicscience <b>techniques</b>, and equipmentdesign talents. Systems should be developed, and then adapted by various local <b>personnel</b> who are utilized as \"test subjects.\" The test subjects will need special training, but then they should be put to work on their regular jobs and our re<b>search</b> team should observe and evaluate. Support for a <b>microdocumentation</b> re<b>search</b> project may well have to include funds to pay for the cost of equipment and extra time involved in the subjects' participation, unless the sponsor of their principal effort is willing to experiment outside of what will probably be his direct interest.<br><br>4. Physical Communication Channels, and Special Codes. In the long run, it seems very likely that the effective use of closely coupled aid in the <b>individual</b>'s symbolmanipulation systeme.g., another human, or machineswill require improved methods of transmitting information between the <b>informationhandling</b> entities. This may not be far in the future, either. A professional person might be able to make a great deal more effective use of symbolprinting or symbolrecording devices if communicating control and symbolic data to them were significantly more convenient and faster than it is with a typewriter. In any event, the possibilities which we have developed promise to be of considerable interest to other segments of our technical society, and do not have to be justified completely within our Program A. My own feeling is that work on sophisticated binary transmitting and receiving <b>techniques</b> for human communication would be very appropriate and stimulating for our Program, and should be started as soon as possible.<br><br>5. Automated Training for Physical Skills. Parts of this are closely related to the above communicationchannel work, but there are extensive activities in either field that remain separate. Both possibilities (Items 4 and 5) are discussed briefly in the memo of 23 September 1960.<br><br>It seems reasonable that fundamentally new aspects of learning theory and technique could emerge from this work, and that some very interesting experimental <b>techniques</b> for plumbing other functional aspects of the nervous systems of men and animals could be developed. A re<b>search</b> team might include three people with skills in educational psychology and digital technology, and with access to consultation in neurophysiology.<br><br>6. Long-Term SmallGroup Teamwork. How a group of <b>individual</b>s can cooperate closely upon the long-term solution of a complex <b>problem</b>, or interrelated set of <b>problem</b>s, can most likely be affected considerably by the <b>techniques</b> and procedures for communicating, for representing the changing state of affairs, for integrating the many different kinds of contributions each can make, etc. Kennedy and Putt [1] discussed what they called a \"contextual map,\" which was a way of representing the status and projections for a program by classifying the activity segments that would make up the program, laying out a twodimensional coordinate system that gave temporal significance to the relative locations of the \"segments\" (on the wall of a room, or on a big board), and by tacking to these locations notecards that described relevant status or plans. </div><div id='full_3'><mark>It seems very likely that the same kinds of <b>techniques</b> and procedures proposed for the <b>microdocumentation</b> project could be utilized by a group of <b>individual</b>s to give them the means to communicate and represent meaningful information, and allow them to develop special procedures for group cooperation, that could do a great deal toward improving the effectiveness of the coupling of the different <b>individual</b>s to the <b>problem</b>(s) at hand.</mark></div><div> No specific planning has been undertaken yet.<br><br>7. SmallGroup Teamwork, on the Spot. Apparently no effective set of <b>techniques</b> and procedures has ever been developed to enable a group of <b>individual</b>s to sit down together and tackle a <b>problem</b> in a way that makes any kind of efficient usage of the total intellectual resources at hand. Roberts' Rules of Order at least provide stability and systematic procedure for situations where they are applicable, but there surely are systems that could be developed which would be at least as satisfactory in these respects and yet be a good deal more efficient. Some relatively crude innovations in parallel communication (channels that would allow information exchange without interrupting the \"speaker\") in <b>individual</b> and group display devices, and in procedures utilizing these, could offer significant improvements, and would provide very good experience in trying to do something about this <b>problem</b> which bothers almost every committee participant. Work under Items 3 and 4 would be quite pertinent. No specific planning yet.</div>",

        "full": "<div>Program On Human Effectiveness<br><br>by Douglas C. Engelbart <br>Stanford Research Institute, Computer Techniques Laboratory, Menlo Park, California. <br>December 1961<br><br>I. Introduction<br><br>Human beings face ever more complex and urgent <b>problems</b>, and their effectiveness in dealing with these <b>problems</b> is a matter that is critical to the stability and continued <b>progress</b> of society. A human is effective not just because he applies to a problem a high degree of native intelligence or physical strength (with a full measure of motivation and purposefulness), but also because he makes use of efficient tools, <b>methods</b>, and strategies. These latter may be directly modified for <b>increased</b> effectiveness. A plan to systematically evolve such <b>modifications</b> has been developed at Stanford Research Institute. The plan is a long-range one and is based on the premise that a strong, coordinated <b>attack</b> is necessary if significant <b>progress</b> is to be made.<br>The possibilities we are pursuing involve an integrated man-machine working relationship, where close, continuous interaction with a computer avails the human of radically changed information-handling and -portrayal skills, and where clever utilization of these skills provides radical changes in the way the human <b>attack</b>s <b>problems</b>. Our aim is to bring significant improvement to the real-life problem-<b>solving</b> effectiveness of individuals. It is felt that such a <b>program</b> competes in social significance with research toward harnessing thermonuclear power, exploring outer space, or conquering cancer, and that the potential payoffs warrant a concerted <b>attack</b> on the principal problem areas.<br><br>The basic <b>concept</b> of utilizing technological aids in close cooperation with an <b>individual's</b> detailed problem-<b>solving</b> activities is not new. Indeed, our books, pencils and typewriters attest to a long evolution of the <b>concept</b>. In recent years however, a number of basically new approaches to the problem have been initiated. Several researchers (2-8) have pointed out the gains offered by close integration of modern information-handling equipment with the human problem <b>solver</b>. Many contributions have been made in different disciplinary areas--e.g. human engineering, problem-solvillg and educational psychology, linguistics, computer <b>program</b>ming, electronic display systems, computer time sharing, operations research, management science, systems engineering, and industrial engineering--all of which appear to form part of a normal evolutionary development toward <b>increased</b> understanding of man-machine integration <b>problems</b>. Also, a number of efforts (9-13) are under way that bear more directly upon the type of man-computer cooperation envisaged in our <b>program</b>; however, none of these has revealed as basic an approach as that proposed herein. Perhaps the most useful work to guide our early activities is that in artificial intelligence and heuristic <b>program</b>ming (14-16), where problem-<b>solving</b> processes and nlethods of approach have been developed for totally man-made systems.<br><br>II. Background<br><br>For other than intuitional or reflexive actions, an individual thinks and works his way through his <b>problems</b> by <b>manipulating</b> <b>concept</b>s before his mind's eye. His powers of memory and visualization are too limited to let him solve very mally of his problellls by doing this entirely in his mind. For most real-life <b>problems</b>, an individual needs to represent these <b>concept</b>s with numbers, letters, words, graphs, drawings, etc. (i.e., with <b>symbols</b>) that can be assembled and rearranged before his eyes in patterns that portray the <b>concept</b>ual relationships to be considered. We conventionally use marks on paper for thus augmenting our visualization and memory capabilities.<br></div><div id='full_3'><mark>Thus, a large part of an <b>individual's</b> meaningful intellectual activity involves the purposeful manipulation of <b>concept</b>s; and of this <b>concept</b>-manipulation activity, a very important part is accomplished by the external manipulation of <b>symbols</b>.</mark></div><div> A fundamental hypothesis of the proposed approach is that the ability of a given human to control the real-time external manipulation of <b>symbols</b>, in response to the minute-by-minute needs of his thought processes, has a profound effect upon the whole structure of <b>concept</b>s and <b>methods</b> utilized in his intellectual activity. </div><div id='full_2'><mark>The approach can be succinctly described by saying that our aim is to use the best that technology can offer in providing <b>increased</b> symbol-manipulation power to the human, and then to explore the resulting possibilities for redesigning his structure of <b>concept</b>s and <b>methods</b> in order to make him significantly more effective in <b>solving</b> real-life <b>problems</b>.</mark></div><div><br><br>For this application, the stereotyped image of the computer as only a <b>mathematical</b> instrument is too limiting--essentially, a computer can manipulate any symbol in any describable way. It is not just <b>mathematical</b> or other formal <b>methods</b> that are being considered.Our aim is to give help in <b>manipulating</b> any of the <b>concept</b>s that the individual usefully symbolizes in his work, of which those of <b>mathematical</b> nature comprise but a limited portion in most real-life instances.<br><br>Initially, at least, ours is all engineering approach toward the task of redesigning different parts of a functioning system in order to increase its performance. Our model stems from the picture of the \"neuro-muscular\" human, with his basic sensory, mental, and motor capabilities, and the means employed to match these capabilities to the <b>problems</b> he must face. These means have for the most part been evolved within the culture in which he is born, and he has been training in their use since childhood. We refer here to all of the tricks, tools, techniques, <b>methods</b>, strategies, special skills, etc., that the individual human can bring to bear upon his struggle with his <b>problems</b>. Our initial approach toward making the human more effective is to try to do a coordinated re-vamping of these means of augmenting basic human capabilities.<br><br>We have found four useful categories with which to divide these augmentation means:<br><br>(1) Language, which includes (a) the way the human's picture of his world is parcelled into tlle <b>concept</b>s that his mind uses to model that world, and (b) the <b>symbols</b> that he attaches to those <b>concept</b>s and with which he represents them when he does his <b>concept</b> manipulation (or \"thinking\").<br><br>(2) Artifacts, which we define as (a) the physical things designed to provide for his physical comfort and movements, (b) the tools and equipment that help him manipulate physical objects or materials, and (c) the tools and equipment that help him manipulate <b>symbols</b> (and therefore, <b>concept</b>s, or information).<br><br>(3) Methodology, which represents the <b>methods</b>, procedures, strategies, etc., with which he organizes his execution of a process.<br><br>(4) Training, which represents the conditioning needed by the human to bring his skills in the utilization of Items (1), (2), and (3) to the point where they are operationally effective.<br><br>We then have a functional model of a trained human, with his Language, Artifacts and Methodology, as the problem-<b>solving</b> system whose effectiveness we want to improve. Our aim is to make coordinated improvements upon the Language, Artifacts, and Methodology that he uses, and the Training that he is given.<br><br>III. The Plan<br><br>A. Objectives<br><br>1. Long Range<br><br>The long-range objective of this <b>program</b> is to increase significantly the effectiveness of human problem <b>solver</b>s. At any given stage of <b>progress</b>, our aim will be to recognize the controllable factors that limit the <b>individual's</b> particular level of effectiveness, and to develop means for raising that level.<br>We are concerned with an <b>individual's</b> ability to gain comprehension in complex problem situations, to recognize the key factors therein, to develop effective solutions to these <b>problems</b>, and to see that these solutions are successfully implemented. </div><div id='full_1'><mark>Problem-<b>solving</b> effectiveness is improved if solutions can be found to <b>problems</b> that previously were too \"hard\" to solve at all, or for previously solvable <b>problems</b> if the same solutions could be found in a shorter time, or if a better solution could be found within the same time.</mark></div><div><br><br>2. </div><div id='full_4'><mark>Short Range(Two to Three Years)<br><br>The immediate objective of this <b>program</b> is to increase the effectiveness of individuals at special problem-<b>solving</b> tasks of our own designation, using the most sophisticated approach we can, and striving for comprehensive and integrated re-design of the individuals' means for working (see Section III B for discussion of these special tasks).</mark></div><div> We want to use this effort as a calibration of what can be achieved, as an introduction to the variety of difficulties associated with this particular type of an engineering approach to a human-capability problem and as an opportunity to develop sound research <b>methods</b> within a workably limited scope of activity.<br><br>B. General Approach<br><br>In view of the tremendous worth to society of any new development that could bring significant increase to the effectiveness of its planners, researchers, coordinators, arbitrators, etc., we feel that the approach offering the highest possible research payoff should be taken. This, together with the tremendous rate of development in the information-processing technology (hence the predictable widespread utilization of sophisticated equipment), impel us toward starting right out with the best that technology can offer now in the way of equipment to help the individual manipulate <b>symbols</b>.<br>A test subject will therefore have a digital computer whose capabilities are immediately available to his every call for service. He will communicate with the computer from a working station equipped with personal display and input devices that hopefully need make no compromise in giving him the best useable features that we can buy or develop. These facilities shall be continuously re-evaluated in light of other developments within the <b>program</b>, and it is expected that equipment <b>modifications</b> will be developed and tested as part of the <b>program</b>.<br><br>At any given stage of our research, we shall be making a coordinated development of both the special <b>program</b>med-computer services that the subject can call upon, and the associated special <b>methods</b> for his using these services in <b>manipulating</b> <b>symbols</b>. Different sets of services and <b>methods</b> will be evaluated by measuring the subject's performance while using them on specially selected test tasks, until we have isolated a set of such services and <b>methods</b> that provide him with a significant degree of effectiveness at the given type of test task.<br><br>We plan a sequence of tasks, initially involving primitive but essential symbol-manipulation capabilities such as composing and modifying different forms of information portrayal (text, diagrams, etc.). This will lead <b>progress</b>ively through developments for intermedi ate capabilities of personal \"bookkeeping,\" composing or modifying computer-service designations (<b>program</b>ming), calculating, planning, etc. Upon an integrated base of such human-controlled, machine-aided capabilities, we plan finally to develop the highest-ordered processes that real-world problem <b>solver</b>s can utilize.<br><br>The special problem-<b>solving</b> areas to which we first wish to apply our efforts toward <b>increased</b> effectiveness have been selected to satisfy the following criteria:<br><br>(a) The areas should involve a limited domain of information, and limited exterllal-world interaction, to keep the system we are studying within a manageable scope.<br><br>(b) The areas should involve intellectually challenging <b>problems</b> of the same qualitative character as possessed by our more general real-world <b>problems</b>.<br><br>(c) The areas should be such that we can build upon our results if we are successful and decide to tackle a more general problem-<b>solving</b> area in a next stage of pursuit of our main objective. (i.e., the services and <b>methods</b> developed here can be extended to meet the needs of the problem <b>solver</b> of the succeeding stage of our <b>program</b>.)<br><br>(d) In general, the areas should be such that success could lead fairly directly to worthwhile real-world applications for bringing <b>increased</b> effectiveness to specialists in critical areas, in parallel with continued research work toward helping the <b>solver</b>s of more general <b>problems</b>.<br><br>(e) In particular, the areas should be such that success here could be applied to meaningful parts of our continuing research activity, to make significant increases in the effectiveness with which we do research on human effectiveness.<br><br>IV. Personnel and Facilities<br><br>It is estimated that eight to ten professional people representing a variety of disciplines will be required for successful pursuit of the objectives of the proposed <b>program</b>. Psychology, computer <b>program</b>ming, and computer engineering comprise a set of essential disciplines; in addition, considerable benefit would be derived from personnel backgrounds in such fields as artificial intelligence, systems analysis, display engineering, time-and-motion study, management science, psycho-linguistics, and information retrieval. Since the <b>program</b> will be developing a new <b>concept</b>ual structure involving a number of disci plines, researchers from each discipline will to some extent the expected to adjust to this newly evolving structure and its terminology.<br>The heart of the experimental facilities will be a digital computer capable of working in real time with test subjects. The computer must be highly flexible with respect to the amount of internal high-speed storage and the type and amount of external storage that can be added. In addition, the computer must lend itself readily to time-sharing utilization. The internal structure of the computer must be susceptible to ready modification as must also be the specially developed peripheral equipment with which it must work closely.<br><br>Two principal alternatives for realizing such experimental facilities exist. The first involves acquiring a small, fast medium-priced machine especially suited to the needs of this <b>program</b>. The second involves acquiring the basic computational service from a large machine whose use is shared (on a time-shared basis) with other users; in this case, only special-purpose matching and buffering equipment will be required for the particular needs of the <b>program</b>. In either case, the working station(s), with individual input and display provisions, will initially be composed of commercially available equipment but will undergo a fair degree of modification as the desired functional requirements evolve.<br><br></div><div id='full_0'><mark>V. Development and Application Activity<br><br>There will be a <b>progress</b>ion of special problem-<b>solving</b> areas through which the <b>program</b> moves as we methodically build up the different capabilities which comprise the full and integrated repertoire needed for generalized real-world problem <b>solving</b>.</mark></div><div> It is planned to guide this <b>progress</b>ion so that within a few years we can begin to utilize our results in an associated Development and Application activity, where we develop special system designs (equipment, processes, <b>methods</b>, training, etc.) that can be applied practically to the tasks of real-world specialists. A computer <b>program</b>mer seems a natural candidate for the first such development, and cryptographers, information specialists, teaching-machine <b>program</b> composers, etc., can be considered subsequently.

C. Engelbart<br><br>Abstract<br><br>This is an initial summary report of a project taking a new and systematic approach to improving the intellectual effectiveness of the individual human being. A detailed conceptual framework explores the nature of the system composed of the individual and the tools, <b>concepts</b>, and methods that match his basic capabilities to his problems. One of the tools that shows the greatest immediate promise is the computer, when it can be harnessed for direct on-line assistance, integrated with new <b>concepts</b> and methods.<br><br>Foreword<br><br>This report describes a study that was carried on at Stanford Research Institute under the joint sponsorship of the Institute and the Directorate of Information Sciences of the Air Force Office of Scientific Research [Contract AF 49(638)-1024]. Mrs. Rowena Swanson was the AFOSR Project Supervisor for this study.<br><br>I . INTRODUCTION<br><br>A. GENERAL<br><br>By \"augmenting human intellect\" we mean increasing the capability of a man to approach a complex problem situation, to gain comprehension to suit his particular needs, and to derive solutions to problems. Increased capability in this respect is taken to mean a mixture of the following: more-rapid comprehension, better comprehension, the possibility of gaining a useful degree of comprehension in a situation that previously was too complex, speedier solutions, better solutions, and the possibility of finding solutions to problems that before seemed insoluble. And by \"complex situations\" we include the professional problems of diplomats, <b>executives</b>, social scientists, life scientists, physical scientists, attorneys, designers--whether the problem situation exists for twenty minutes or twenty years. We do not speak of isolated clever tricks that help in particular situations. We refer to a way of life in an integrated domain where hunches, cut-and-try, intangibles, and the human \"feel for a situation\" usefully co-exist with powerful <b>concepts</b>, streamlined terminology and notation, sophisticated methods, and high-powered electronic aids.<br><br>Man's population and gross product are increasing at a considerable rate, but the complexity of his problems grows still faster, and the urgency with which solutions must be found becomes steadily greater in response to the increased rate of activity and the increasingly global nature of that activity. Augmenting man's intellect, in the sense defined above, would warrant full pursuit by an enlightened society if there could be shown a reasonable approach and some plausible benefits.<br><br>This report covers the first phase of a program aimed at developing means to augment the human intellect. These \"means\" can include many things--all of which appear to be but extensions of means developed andused in the past to help man apply his native sensory, <b>mental</b>, and motor capabilities--and we consider the whole system of a human and his augmentation means as a proper field of search for practical possibilities. It is a very important system to our society, and like most systems its performance can best be improved by considering the whole as a set of interacting components rather than by considering the components in isolation.<br><br>This kind of system approach to human intellectual effectiveness does not find a ready-made conceptual framework such as exists for established disciplines. Before a research program can be designed to pursue such an approach intelligently, so that practical benefits might be derived within a reasonable time while also producing results of longrange significance, a conceptual framework must be searched out--a framework that provides orientation as to the important factors of the system, the relationships among these factors, the types of change among the system factors that offer likely improvements in performance, and the sort of research goals and methodology that seem promising.1<br><br>In the first (search) phase of our program we have developed a conceptual framework that seems satisfactory for the current needs of designing a research phase. Section II contains the essence of this framework as derived from several different ways of looking at the system made up of a human and his intellect-augmentation means.<br><br>The <b>process</b> of developing this conceptual framework brought out a number of significant realizations: that the intellectual effectiveness exercised today by a given human has little likelihood of being intelligence limited--that there are dozens of disciplines in engineering, mathematics, and the social, life, and physical sciences that can contribute improvements to the system of intellect-augmentation means; that any one such improvement can be expected to trigger a chain of coordinatingimprovements; that until every one of these disciplines comes to a standstill and we have exhausted all the improvement possibilities we could glean from it, we can expect to continue to develop improvements in this human-intellect system; that there is no particular reason not to expect gains in personal intellectual effectiveness from a concerted systemoriented approach that compare to those made in personal geographic mobility since horseback and sailboat days.<br><br>The picture of how one can view the possibilities for a systematic approach to increasing human intellectual effectiveness, as put forth in Section II in the sober and general terms of an initial basic analysis, does not seem to convey all of the richness and promise that was stimulated by the development of that picture. Consequently, Section III is intended to present some definite images that illustrate meaningful possibilities deriveable from the conceptual framework presented in Section II--and in a rather marked deviation from ordinary technical writing, a good portion of Section III presents these images in a fiction-dialogue style as a mechanism for transmitting a feeling for the richness and promise of the possibilities in one region of the improvement space\" that is roughly mapped in Section II.<br><br>The style of Section III seems to make for easier reading. If Section II begins to seem unrewardingly difficult, the reader may find it helpful to skip from Section II-B directly to Section III. If it serves its purpose well enough, Section III will provide a context within which the reader can go back and finish Section II with less effort.<br><br>In Section IV (Research Recommendations) we present a general strategy for pursuing research toward increasing human intellectual effectiveness. This strategy evolved directly from the <b>concepts</b> presented in Sections II and III; one of its important precepts is to pursue the quickest gains first, and use the increased intellectual effectiveness thus derived to help pursue successive gains. We see the quickest gains emerging from (1) giving the human the minute-by-minute services of a digital computer equipped with computer-driven cathode-ray-tube display, and (2) developing the new methods of thinking and working that allow the human to capitalizeupon the computer's help. By this same strategy, we recommend that an initial research effort develop a prototype system of this sort aimed at increasing human effectiveness in the task of computer programming.<br><br>To give the reader an initial orientation about what sort of thing this computer-aided working system might be, we include below a short description of a possible system of this sort. This illustrative example is not to be considered a description of the actual system that will emerge from the program. It is given only to show the general direction of the work, and is clothed in fiction only to make it easier to visualize.<br><br>Let us consider an augmented architect at work. He sits at a working station that has a visual display screen some three feet on a side; this is his working surface, and is controlled by a computer (his \"clerk\" ) with which he can communicate by means of a small keyboard and various other devices.<br><br>He is designing a building. He has already dreamed up several basic layouts and <b>structural</b> forms, and is trying them out on the screen. The surveying data for the layout he is working on now have already been entered, and he has just coaxed the clerk to show him a perspective view of the steep hillside building site with the roadway above, <b>symbolic</b> representations of the various trees that are to remain on the lot, and the service tie points for the different utilities. The view occupies the left two-thirds of the screen. With a \"pointer,\" he indicates two points of interest, moves his left hand rapidly over the keyboard, and the distance and elevation between the points indicated appear on the right- hand third of the screen.<br><br>Now he enters a reference line with his pointer, and the keyboard. Gradually the screen begins to show the work he is doing--a neat excavation appears in the hillside) revises itself slightly, and revises itself again. After a moment, the architect changes the scene on the screen to an overhead plan view of the site, still showing the excavation. A few minutes of study, and he enters on the keyboard a list of items, checking each one as it appears on the screen, to be studied later.<br><br>Ignoring the representation on the display, the architect next begins to enter a series of specifications and data--a six-inch slab floor, twelve-inch concrete walls eight feet high within the excavation, and so on. When he has finished, the revised scene appears on the screen. A structure is taking shape. He examines it, adjusts it, pauses long enough to ask for handbook or catalog information from the clerk at various points, and readjusts accordingly. He often recalls from the \"clerk\" his working lists of specifications and considerations to refer to them, modify them, or add to them. These lists grow into an evermore-detailed, interlinked structure, which represents the maturing thought behind the actual design.<br><br>Prescribing different planes here and there, curved surfaces occasionally, and moving the whole structure about five feet, he finally has the rough external form of the building balanced nicely with the setting and he is assured that this form is basically compatible with the materials to be used as well as with the function of the building.<br><br>Now he begins to enter detailed information about the interior. Here the capability of the clerk to show him any view he wants to examine (a slice of the interior, or how the structure would look from the roadway above) is important. He enters particular fixture designs, and examines them in a particular room. He checks to make sure that sun glare from the windows will not blind a driver on the roadway, and the \"clerk\" computes the information that one window will reflect strongly onto the roadway between 6 and 6:30 on midsummer mornings.<br><br>Next he begins a functional analysis. He has a list of the people who will occupy this building, and the daily sequences of their activtites. The \"clerk\" allows him to follow each in turn, examining how doors swing, where special lighting might be needed. Finally he has the \"clerk\" combine all of these sequences of activity to indicate spots where traffic is heavy in the building, or where congestion might occur, and to determine what the severest drain on the utilities is likely to be.<br><br>All of this information (the building design and its associated \"thought structure\") can be stored on a tape to represent the design manual for the building. Loading this tape into his own clerk, another architect, a builder, or the client can maneuver within this design manual to pursue whatever details or insights are of interest to him--and can append special notes that are integrated into the design manual for his own or someone else's later benefit.<br><br>In such a future working relationship between human problem-solver and computer 'clerk,' the capability of the computer for executing mathematical <b>process</b>es would be used whenever it was needed. However, the computer has many other capabilities for manipulating and displaying information that can be of significant benefit to the human in nonmathematical <b>process</b>es of planning, organizing, studying, etc. Every person who does his thinking with symbolized <b>concepts</b> (whether in the form of the English language, pictographs, formal logic, or mathematics) should be able to benefit significantly.<br><br>B. OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br><br>The objective of this study is to develop a conceptual framework within which could grow a coordinated research and development program whose goals would be the following: (1) to find the factors that limit the effectiveness of the individual's basic information-handling capabilities in meeting the various needs of society for problem solving in its most general sense; and (2) to develop new techniques, procedures, and systems that will better match these basic capabilities to the needs' problems, and progress of society. We have placed the following specifications on this framework:<br><br>1. That it provide perspective for both long-range basic research and research that will yield practical results soon.<br>2. That it indicate what this augmentation will actually involve in the way of changes in working environment, in thinking, in skills, and in methods of working.<br>3. That it be a basis for evaluating the possible relevance of work and knowledge from existing fields and for assimilating whatever is relevant.<br>4. That it reveal areas where research is possible and ways to assess the research, be a basis for choosing starting points, and indicate how to develop appropriate methodologies for the needed research.<br><br>Two points need emphasis here. First, although a conceptual framework has been constructed, it is still rudimentary. Further search, and actual research, are needed for the evolution of the framework. Second, even if our conceptual framework did provide an accurate and complete basic analysis of the system from which stems a human's intellectual effectiveness, the explicit nature of future improved systems would be highly affected by (expected) changes in our technology or in our understanding of the human being.<br><br>II. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK<br><br>A. GENERAL<br><br>The conceptual framework we seek must orient us toward the real possibilities and problems associated with using modern technology to give direct aid to an individual in comprehending complex situations, isolating the significant factors, and solving problems. To gain this orientation, we examine how individuals achieve their present level of effectiveness, and expect that this examination will reveal possibilities for improvement.<br><br>The entire effect of an individual on the world stems essentially from what he can transmit to the world through his limited motor channels. This in turn is based on information received from the outside world through limited sensory channels; on information, drives, and needs generated within him; and on his <b>process</b>ing of that information. His <b>process</b>ing is of two kinds: that which he is generally conscious of (recognizing patterns, remembering, visualizing, abstracting, deducing, inducing, etc.), and that involving the unconscious <b>process</b>ing and mediating of received and self-generated information, and the unconscious mediating of conscious <b>process</b>ing itself.<br><br>The individual does not use this information and this <b>process</b>ing to grapple directly with the sort of complex situation in which we seek to give him help. He uses his innate capabilities in a rather more indirect fashion, since the situation is generally too complex to yield directly to his motor actions, and always too complex to yield comprehensions and solutions from direct sensory inspection and use of basic cognitive capabilities. For instance, an aborigine who possesses all of our basic sensory-<b>mental</b>-motor capabilities, but does not possess our background of indirect knowledge and procedure, cannot organize the proper direct actions necessary to drive a car through traffic, request a book from the library, call a committee meeting to discuss a tentative plan, call someone on the telephone, or compose a letter on the typewriter.<br><br>Our culture has evolved means for us to organize the little things we can do with our basic capabilities so that we can derive comprehension from truly complex situations, and accomplish the <b>process</b>es of deriving and implementing problem solutions. The ways in which human capabilities are thus extended are here called augmentation means, and we define four basic classes of them:<br><br>1. Artifacts--physical objects designed to provide for human comfort, for the manipulation of things or materials, and for the manipulation of symbols.<br>2. Language--the way in which the individual parcels out the picture of his world into the <b>concepts</b> that his mind uses to model that world, and the symbols that he attaches to those <b>concepts</b> and uses in consciously manipulating the <b>concepts</b> (\"thinking\").<br>3. Methodology--the methods, procedures, strategies, etc., with which an individual organizes his goal-centered (problem-solving) activity.<br>4. Training--the conditioning needed by the human being to bring his skills in using Means 1, 2, and 3 to the point where they are operationally effective.<br><br>The system we want to improve can thus be visualized as a trained human being together with his <b>artifacts</b>, language, and methodology. The explicit new system we contemplate will involve as <b>artifacts</b> computers, and computer-controlled information-storage, information-handling, and information-display devices. The aspects of the conceptual framework that are discussed here are primarily those relating to the human being's ability to make significant use of such equipment in an integrated system.<br><br>Pervading all of the augmentation means is a particular structure or organization. While an untrained aborigine cannot drive a car through traffic, because he cannot leap the gap between his cultural background and the kind of world that contains cars and traffic, it is possible to move step by step through an organized training program that will enable him to drive effectively and safely. In other words, the human mind neither learns nor acts by large leaps, but by steps organized or structured so that each one depends upon previous steps.<br><br>Although the size of the step a human being can take in comprehension, innovation, or execution is small in comparison to the over-all size of the step needed to solve a complex problem, human beings nevertheless do solve complex problems. It is the augmentation means that serve to break down a large problem in such a way that the human being can walk through it with his little steps, and it is the structure or organization of these little steps or actions that we discuss as <b>process</b> <b>hierarchies</b>.<br><br>Every <b>process</b> of thought or action is made up of sub-<b>process</b>es. Let us consider such examples as making a pencil stroke, writing a letter of the alphabet, or making a plan. Quite a few discrete muscle movements are organized into the making of a pencil stroke; similarly, making particular pencil strokes and making a plan for a letter are complex <b>process</b>es in themselves that become sub-<b>process</b>es to the over-all writing of an alphabetic character.<br><br>Although every sub-<b>process</b> is a <b>process</b> in its own right, in that it consists of further sub-<b>process</b>es, there seems to be no point here in looking for the ultimate bottom of the <b>process</b>-hierarchical structure. There seems to be no way of telling whether or not the apparent bottoms (<b>process</b>es that cannot be further subdivided) exist in the physical world or in the limitations of human understanding.<br><br>In any case, it is not necessary to begin from the bottom in discussing particular <b>process</b> <b>hierarchies</b>. No person uses a <b>process</b> that is completely unique every time he tackles something new. Instead, he begins from a group of basic sensory-<b>mental</b>-motor <b>process</b> capabilities, and adds to these certain of the <b>process</b> capabilities of his <b>artifacts</b>. There are only a finite number of such basic human and artifact capabilities from which to draw. Furthermore, even quite different higher order <b>process</b>es may have in common relatively high-order sub-<b>process</b>es\".<br><br>When a man writes prose text (a reasonably high-order <b>process</b>), he makes use of many <b>process</b>es as sub-<b>process</b>es that are common to other high-order <b>process</b>es. For example, he makes use of planning, composing, dictating. The <b>process</b> of writing is utilized as a sub-<b>process</b> within many different <b>process</b>es of a still higher order, such as organizing a committee, changing a policy, and so on.<br><br>What happens, then, is that each individual develops a certain repertoire of <b>process</b> capabilities from which he selects and adapts those that will compose the <b>process</b>es that he executes. This repertoire is like a tool kit, and just as the mechanic must know what his tools can do and how to use them, so the intellectual worker must know the capabilities of his tools and have good methods, strategies, and rules of thumb for making use of them. All of the <b>process</b> capabilities in the individual's repertoire rest ultimately upon basic capabilities within him or his <b>artifacts</b>, and the entire repertoire represents an inter-knit, hierarchical structure (which we often call the repertoire hierarchy).<br><br>We find three general categories of <b>process</b> capabilities within a typical individual's repertoire. There are those that are executed completely within the human integument, which we call explicit-human <b>process</b> capabilities; there are those possessed by <b>artifacts</b> for executing <b>process</b>es without human intervention, which we call explicit-artifact <b>process</b> capabilities; and there are what we call the composite <b>process</b> capabilities, which are derived from <b>hierarchies</b> containing both of the other kinds.<br><br>We assume that it is our H-LAM/T system (Human using Lauguage, Artifacts, Methodology, in which he is Trained) that has the capability and that performs the <b>process</b> in any instance of use of this repertoire. Let us look within the <b>process</b> structure for the LAM/T ingredients, to get a better \"feel\" for our models. Consider the <b>process</b> of writing an important memo.There is a particular concept associated with this <b>process</b> -- that of putting information into a formal package and distributing it to a set of people for a certain kind of consideration -- and the type of information package associated with this concept has been given the special name of memorandum. Already the system language shows the effect of this <b>process</b>--i.e., a concept and its name.<br><br>The memo-writing <b>process</b> may be executed by using a set of <b>process</b> capabilities (in intermixed or repetitive form) such as the following planning, developing subject matter, composing text, producing hard copy, and distributing. There is a definite way in which these sub-<b>process</b>es will be organized that represents part of the system methodology. Each of these sub-<b>process</b>es represents a functional concept that must be a part of the system language if it is to be organized effectively into the human's way of doing things, and the <b>symbolic</b> portrayal of each concept must be such that the human can work with it and remember it.<br><br>If the memo is simple, a paragraph or so in length, then the first three <b>process</b>es may well be of the explicit-human type (i.e., it may be planned, developed) and composed within the mind) and the last two of the composite type. If it is a complex memo, involving a good deal of careful planning and development, then all of the sub-<b>process</b>es might well be of the composite type (e.g., at least including the use of pencil and paper <b>artifacts</b>)' and there might be many different applications of some of the <b>process</b> capabilities within the total <b>process</b> (i.e., successive drafts, revised plans).<br><br>The set of sub-<b>process</b> capabilities discussed so far, if called upon in proper occasion and sequence, would indeed enable the execution of the memo-writing <b>process</b>. However, the very <b>process</b> of organizing and supervising the utilization of these sub-<b>process</b> capabilities is itself a most important sub-<b>process</b> of the memo-writing <b>process</b>. Hence, the sub- <b>process</b> capabilities as listed would not be complete without the addition of a seventh capability--what we call the executive capability. This is the capability stemming from habit, strategy, rules of thumb, prejudice, learned method, intuition, unconscious dictates, or combinations thereof, to call upon the appropriate sub-<b>process</b> capabilities with a particular sequence and timing. An executive <b>process</b> (i.e., the exercise of an executive capability) involves such sub-<b>process</b>es as planning, selecting, and supervising, and it is really the executive <b>process</b>es that embody all of the methodology in the H-LAM/T system.<br><br>To illustrate the capability-hierarchy features of our conceptual framework, let us consider an artifact innovation appearing directly within the relatively low-order capability for composing and modifying written text, and see how this can affect a (or, for instance, your) hierarchy of capabilities. Suppose you had a new writing machine--think of it as a high-speed electric typewriter with some special features. You could operate its keyboard to cause it to write text much as you could use a conventional typewriter. But the printing mechanism is more complicated; besides printing a visible character at every stroke, it adds special encoding features by means of invisible selective components in the ink and special shaping of the character.<br><br>As an auxiliary device, there is a gadget that is held like a pencil and, instead of a point, has a special sensing mechanism that you can pass over a line of the special printing from your writing machine (or one like it). The signals which this reading stylus sends through the flexible connecting wire to the writing machine are used to determine which characters are being sensed and thus to cause the automatic typing of a duplicate string of characters. An information-storage mechanism in the writing machine permits you to sweep the reading stylus over the characters much faster than the writer can type; the writer will catch up with you when you stop to think about what word or string of words should be duplicated next, or while you reposition the straightedge guide along which you run the stylus.<br><br>This writing machine would permit you to use a new <b>process</b> of composing text. For instance, trial drafts could rapidly be composed from re-arranged excerpts of old drafts, together with new words or passages which you stop to type in. Your first draft could represent a free outpouring of thoughts in any order, with the inspection of foregoing thoughts continuously stimulating new considerations and ideas to be entered. If the tangle of thoughts represented by the draft became too complex, you would compile a reordered draft quickly. It would be practical for you to accommodate more complexity in the <b>trails</b> of thought you might build in search of the path that suits your needs.<br><br>You can integrate your new ideas more easily, and thus harness your creativity more continuously, if you can quickly and flexibly change your working record. If it is easier to update any part of your working record to accommodate new developments in thought or circumstance, you will find it easier to incorporate more complex procedures in your way of doing things. This will probably allow you to accommodate the extra burden associated with, for instance, keeping and using special files whose contents are both contributed to and utilized by any current work in a flexible manner--which in turn enables you to devise and use even-more complex procedures to better harness your talents in your particular working situation.<br><br>The important thing to appreciate here is that a direct new innovation in one particular capability can have far-reaching effects throughout the rest of your capability hierarchy. A change can propagate up through the capability hierarchy; higher-order capabilities that can utilize the initially changed capability can now reorganize to take special advantage of this change and of the intermediate higher-capability changes. A change can propagate down through the hierarchy as a result of new capabilities at the high level and modification possibilities latent in lower levels. These latent capabilities may previously have been unusable in the hierarchy and become usable because of the new capability at the higher level.<br><br>The writing machine and its flexible copying capability would occupy you for a long time if you tried to exhaust the reverberating chain of associated possibilities for making useful innovations within your capability hierarchy. This one innovation could trigger a rather extensive redesign of this hierarchy; your way of accomplishing many of your tasks would change considerably. Indeed this <b>process</b> characterizes the sort of evolution that our intellect-augmentation means have been undergoing since the first human brain appeared.<br><br>To our objective of deriving orientation about possibilities for actively pursuing an increase in human intellectual effectiveness, it is important to realize that we must be prepared to pursue such new- possibility chains throughout the entire capability hierarchy (calling for a system approach). It is also important to realize that we must be oriented to the synthesis of new capabilities from reorganization of other capabilities, both old and new, that exist throughout the hierarchy (calling for a \"system-engineering\" approach).<br><br>B. THE BASIC PERSPECTIVE<br><br>Individuals who operate effectively in our culture have already been considerably \"augmented.\" Basic human capabilities for sensing stimuli, performing numerous <b>mental</b> operations, and for communicating with the outside world, are put to work in our society within a system--an H-LAM/T system--the individual augmented by the language, <b>artifacts</b>, and methodology in which he is trained. Furthermore, we suspect that improving the effectiveness of the individual as he operates in our society should be approached as a system-engineering problem--that is, the H-LAM/T system should be studied as an interacting whole from a synthesis-oriented approach.<br><br>This view of the system as an interacting whole is strongly bolstered by considering the repertoire hierarchy of <b>process</b> capabilities that is structured from the basic ingredients within the H-LAM/T system. The realization that any potential change in language, artifact, or methodology has importance only relative to its use within a <b>process</b>' and that a new <b>process</b> capability appearing anywhere within that hierarchy can make practical a new consideration of latent change possibilities in many other parts of the hierarchy--possibilities in either language, <b>artifacts</b>, or methodology--brings out the strong interrelationship of these three augmentation means.<br><br>Increasing the effectiveness of the individual's use of his basic capabilities is a problem in redesigning the changeable parts of a system. The system is actively engaged in the continuous <b>process</b>es (among others) of developing comprehension within the individual and of solving problems; both <b>process</b>es are subject to human motivation, purpose, and will. To redesign the system's capability for performing these <b>process</b>es means redesigning all or part of the repertoire hierarchy. To redesign a structure, we must learn as much as we can of what is known about the basic materials and components as they are utilized within the structure; beyond that, we must learn how to view, to measure, to analyze, and to evaluate in terms of the functional whole and its purpose. In this particular case, no existing analytic theory is by itself adequate for the purpose of analyzing and evaluating over-all system performance; pursuit of an improved system thus demands the use of experi<b>mental</b> methods.<br><br>It need not be just the very sophisticated or formal <b>process</b> capabilities that are added or modified in this redesign. Essentially any of the <b>process</b>es utilized by a representative human today--the <b>process</b>es that he thinks of when he looks ahead to his day's work--are composite <b>process</b>es of the sort that involve external composing and manipulating of symbols (text, sketches, diagrams, lists, etc.). Many of the external composing and manipulating (modifying, rearranging) <b>process</b>es serve such characteristically \"human\" activities as playing with forms and relationships to ask what develops, cut- and-try multiple-pass development of an idea, or listing items to reflect on and then rearranging and extending them as thoughts develop.<br><br>Existing, or near-future, technology could certainly provide our professional problem-solvers with the <b>artifacts</b> they need to have for duplicating and rearranging text before their eyes, quickly and with a minimum of human effort. Even ao apparently minor an advance could yield total changes in an individual's repertoire hierarchy that would represent a great increase in over-all effectivenesa. Normally the necessary equipment would enter the market slowly; changes from the expected would be small, people would change their ways of doing things a little at a time, and only gradually would their accumulated changes create markets for more radical versions of the equipment. Such an evolutionary <b>process</b> has been typical of the way our repertoire <b>hierarchies</b> have grown and formed.<br><br>But an active research effort, aimed at exploring and evaluating poasible integrated changes throughout the repertoire hierarchy, could greatly accelerate this evolutionary <b>process</b>. The reaearch effort could guide the product development of new <b>artifacts</b> toward taking long-range meaningful steps; simultaneously competitively minded individuals who would respond to demonstrated methods for achieving greater personal effectiveness would create a market for the more radical equipment innovations. The guided evolutionary <b>process</b> could be expected to be considerably more rapid than the traditional one.<br><br>The category of \"more radical innovations\" includes the digital computer as a tool for the personal use of an individual. Here there is not only promise of great flexibility in the composing and rearranging of text and diagrams before the individual's eyes but also promise of many other <b>process</b> capabilities that can be integrated into the H-LAM/T system's repertoire hierarchy.<br><br>C. DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE H-LAM/T SYSTEM<br><br>1. The Source of Intelligence<br><br>When one looks at a computer system that is doing a very complex job, he sees on the surface a machine that can execute some extremely sophisticated <b>process</b>es. If he is a layman, his concept of what provides this sophisticated capability may endow the machine with a mysterious power to sweep information through perceptive and intelligent synthetic thinking devices. Actually, this sophisticated capability results from a very clever organizational hierarchy so that pursuit of the source of intelligence within this system would take one down through layers of functional and physical organization that become successively more primitive.<br><br>To be more specific, we can begin at the top and list the major levels down through which we would pass if we successively decomposed the functional elements of each level in search of the \"source of intelligence.\" A programmer could take us down through perhaps three levels (depending upon the sophistication of the total <b>process</b> being executed by the computer) perhaps depicting the organization at each level with a flow chart. The first level down would organize functions corresponding to <b>statements</b> in a problem-oriented language (e.g., ALGOL or COBOL), to achieve the desired over-all <b>process</b>. The second level down would organize lesser functions into the <b>process</b>es represented by first-level <b>statements</b>. The third level would perhaps show how the basic machine commands (or rather the <b>process</b>es which they represent) were organized to achieve each of the functions of the second level.<br><br>Then a machine designer could take over, and with a block diagram of the computer's organization he could show us (Level 4) how the different hardware units (e.g., random-access storage, arithmetic registers, adder, arithmetic control) are organized to provide the capability of executing sequences of the commands used in Level 3. The logic designer could then give us a tour of Level 5, also using block diagrams, to show us how such hardware elements as pulse gates, flip-flops' and AND, OR, and NOT circuits can be organized into networks giving the functions utilized at Level 4. For Level 6 a circuit engineer could show us diagrams revealing how components such as transistors, resistors, capacitors, and diodes can be organized into modular networks that provide the functions needed for the elements of Level 5.<br><br>Device engineers and physicists of different kinds could take us down through more layers. But rather soon we have crossed the boundary between what is man-organized and what is nature-organized, and are ultimately discussing the way in which a given physical phenomenon is derived from the intrinsic organization of sub-atomic particles, with our ability to explain succeeding layers blocked by the exhaustion of our present human comprehension.<br><br>If we then ask ourselves where that intelligence is embodied, we are forced to concede that it is elusively distributed throughout a hierarchy of functional <b>process</b>es--a hierarchy whose foundation extends down into natural <b>process</b>es below the depth of our comprehension. If there is any one thing upon which this 'intelligence depends' it would seem to be organization. The biologists and physiologists use a term \"synergism\" to designate (from Webster's Unabridged Dictionary, Second Edition) the \"...cooperative action of discrete agencies such that the total effect is greater than the sum of the two effects taken independently...\" This term seems directly applicable here, where we could say that synergism is our most likely candidate for representing the actual source of intelligence<br><br>Actually, each of the social, life, or physical phenomena we observe about us would seem to derive from a supporting hierarchy of organized functions (or <b>process</b>es), in which the synergistic principle gives increased phenomenological sophistication to each succeedingly higher level of organization. In particular, the intelligence of a human being, derived ultimately from the characteristics of individual nerve cells, undoubtedly results from synergism.<br><br>2. Intelligence Amplification<br><br>It has been jokingly suggested several times during the course of this study that what we are seeking is an \"intelligence amplifier.\" (The term is attributed originally to W. Ross Ashby (2,3). At first this term was rejected on the grounds that in our view one's only hope was to make a better match between existing human intelligence and the problems to be tackled, rather than in making man more intelligent. But deriving the <b>concepts</b> brought out in the preceding section has shown us that indeed this term does seem applicable to our objective.<br><br>Accepting the term \"intelligence amplification\" does not imply any attempt to increase native human intelligence. The term \"intelligence amplification\" seems applicable to our goal of augmenting the human intellect in that the entity to be produced will exhibit more of what can be called intelligence than an unaided human could; we will have amplified the intelligence of the human by organizing his intellectual capabilities into higher levels of synergistic structuring. What possesses the amplified intelligence is the resulting H-LAM/T system, in which the LAM/T augmentation means represent the amplifier of the human's intelligence.<br><br>In amplifying our intelligence, we are applying the principle of synergistic structuring that was followed by natural evolution in developing the basic human capabilities. What we have done in the development of our augmentation means is to construct a superstructure that is a synthetic extension of the natural structure upon which it is built. In a very real sense, as represented by the steady evolution of our augmentation means, the development of \"artificial intelligence\" has been going on for centuries.<br><br>3. Two-Domain System<br><br>The human and the <b>artifacts</b> are the only physical components in the H-LAM/T system. It is upon their capabilities that the ultimate capability of the system will depend. This was implied in the earlier statement that every composite <b>process</b> of the system decomposes ultimately into explicit-human and explicit-artifact <b>process</b>es. There are thus two separate domains of activity within the H-LAM/T system: that represented by the human, in which all explicit-human <b>process</b>es occur; and that represented by the <b>artifacts</b>, in which all explicit-artifact <b>process</b>es occur. In any composite <b>process</b>, there is cooperative interaction between the two domains, requiring interchange of energy (much of it for information exchange purposes only). Figure 1 depicts this two domain concept and embodies other <b>concepts</b> discussed below.<br><br>Fig.1: The Two Sides of the H-LAM/T System<br><br>Where a complex machine represents the principal artifact with which a human being cooperates, the term \"man-machine interface\" has been used for some years to represent the boundary across which energy is exchanged between the two domains. However, the \"man-artifact interface\" has existed for centuries, ever since humans began using <b>artifacts</b> and executing composite <b>process</b>es.<br><br>Exchange across this \"interface\" occurs when an explicit-human <b>process</b> is coupled to an explicit-artifact <b>process</b>. Quite often these coupled <b>process</b>es are designed for just this exchange purpose, to provide a functional match between other explicit-human and explicit-artifact <b>process</b>es buried within their respective domains that do the more significant things. For instance, the finger and hand motions (explicit human <b>process</b>es) activate key-linkage motions in the typewriter (couple to explicit-artifact <b>process</b>es). But these are only part of the matching <b>process</b>es between the deeper human <b>process</b>es that direct a given word to be typed and the deeper artifact <b>process</b>es that actually imprint the ink marks on the paper.<br><br>The outside world interacts with our H-LAM/T system by the exchange of energy with either the individual or his artifact. Again, special <b>process</b>es are often designed to accommodate this exchange. However, the direct concern of our present study lies within the system, with the internal <b>process</b>es that are and can be significantly involved in the effectiveness of the system in developing the human's comprehension and pursuing the human's goals.<br><br>4. Concepts, Symbols, and a Hypothesis<br><br>Before we pursue further direct discussion of the H-LAM/T system, let us examine some background material. Consider the following historical progression in the development of our intellectual capabilities:<br><br>1. Concept Manipulation--Humans rose above the lower forms of life by evolving the biological capability for developing abstractions and <b>concepts</b>. They could manipulate these <b>concepts</b> within their minds to a certain extent, and think about situations in the abstract. Their <b>mental</b> capabilities allowed them to develop general <b>concepts</b> from specific instances, predict specific instances from general <b>concepts</b>, associate <b>concepts</b>, remember them, etc. We speak here of <b>concepts</b> in their raw, unverbalized form. For example, a person letting a door swing shut behind him suddenly visualizes the person who follows him carrying a cup of hot coffee and some sticky pastries. Of all the aspects of the pending event, the spilling of the coffee and the squashing of the pastry somehow are abstracted immediately, and associated with a concept of personal responsibility and a dislike for these consequences. But a solution comes to mind immediately as an image of a quick stop and an arm stab back toward the door, with motion and timing that could prevent the collision, and the solution is accepted and enacted. With only non-<b>symbolic</b> concept manipulation, we could probably build primitive shelter, evolve strategies of war and hunt, play games, and make practical jokes. But further powers of intellectual effectiveness are implicit in this stage of biological evolution (the same stage we are in today).<br>2. Symbol Manipulation--Humans made another great step forward when they learned to represent particular <b>concepts</b> in their minds with specific symbols. Here we temporarily disregard communicative speech and writing, and consider only the direct value to the individual of being able to do his heavy thinking by <b>mental</b>ly manipulating symbols instead of the more unwieldly <b>concepts</b> which they represent. Consider, for instance, the <b>mental</b> difficulty involved in herding twenty- seven sheep if, instead of remembering one <b>card</b>inal number and occasionally counting, we had to remember what each sheep looked like, so that if the flock seemed too small we could visualize each one and check whether or not it was there.<br>3. Manual, External, Symbol Manipulation--Another significant step toward harnessing the biologically evolved <b>mental</b> capabilities in pursuit of comprehension and problem solutions came with the development of the means for externalizing some of the symbol-manipulation activity, particularly in graphical representation. This supplemented the individual's memory and ability to visualize. (We are not concerned here with the value derived from human cooperation made possible by speech and writing, both forms of external symbol manipulation. We speak of the manual means of making graphical representations of symbols--a stick and sand, pencil and paper and eraser, straight edge or compass, and so on.) It is principally this kind of means for external symbol manipulation that has been associated with the evolution of the individual's present way of doing his concept manipulation (thinking).<br><br>It is undoubtedly true that <b>concepts</b> which people found useful ended up being symbolized in their language, and hence that the evolution of language was affected by the <b>concepts</b> the people developed and used. However, Korzybski (4) and Whorf (5) (among others) have argued that the language we use affects our thinking to a considerable extent. They say that a lack of words for some types of <b>concepts</b> makes it hard to express those <b>concepts</b>, and thus decreases the likelihood that we will learn much about them. If this is so, then once a language has begun to grow and be used, it would seem reasonable to suspect that the language also affects the evolution of the new <b>concepts</b> to be expressed in that language.<br><br>Apparently there are counter-arguments to this; e.g., if a concept needs to be used often but its expression is difficult, then the language will evolve to ease the situation. However, the studies of the past decade into what are called \"self-organizing\" systems seem to be revealing that subtle relationships among its interacting elements can significantly influence the course of evolution of such a system. If this is true, and if language is (as it seems to be) a part of a selforganizing system, then it seems probable that the state of a language at a given time strongly affects its own evolution to a succeeding state.<br><br>For our conceptual framework, we tend to favor the view that a language does exert a force in its own evolution. We observe that the shift over the last few centuries in matters that are of daily concern to the individual has necessarily been forced into the framework of the language existing at the time, with alterations generally limited to new uses for old words, or the coining of new words. The English language since Shakespeare has undergone no alteration comparable to the alteration in the cultural environment; if it had, Shakespeare would no longer be accessible to us. Under such evolutionary conditions, it would seem unlikely that the language we now use provides the best possible service to our minds in pursuing comprehension and solving problems. It seems very likely that a more useful language form can be devised.<br><br>The Whorfian hypothesis states that the world view of a culture is limited by the structure of the language which that culture uses. But there seems to be another factor to consider in the evolution of language and human reasoning ability. We offer the following hypothesis, which is related to the Whorfian hypothesis: Both the language used by a culture, and the capability for effective intellectual activity are directly affected during their evolution by the means by which individuals control the external manipulation of symbols. (For identification, we will refer to this as the Neo-Whorfian hypothesis.)<br><br>If the Neo-Whorfian hypothesis could be proved readily, and if we could see how our means of externally manipulating symbols influence both our language and our way of thinking, then we would have a valuable instrument for studying human-augmentation possibilities. For the sake of discussion, let us assume the Neo-Whorfian hypothesis to be true, and see what relevant deductions can be made.<br><br>If the means evolved for an individual's external manipulation of his thinking-aid symbols indeed directly affect the way in which he thinks, then the original Whorfian hypothesis would offer an added effect. The direct effect of the external-symbol-manipulation means upon language would produce an indirect effect upon the way of thinking via the Whorfian-hypothesis linkage. There would then be two ways for the manner in which our external symbol manipulation was done to affect our thinking.<br><br>One way of viewing the H-LAM/T system changes that we contemplate--specifically, integrating the capabilities of a digital computer into the intellectual activity of individual humans--is that we are introducing new and extremely advanced means for externally manipulating symbols. We then want to determine the useful modifications in the language and in the way of thinking that could result. This suggests a fourth stage to the evolution of our individual-human intellectual capability:<br><br>4. Automated external symbol manipulation--In this stage, symbols with which the human represents the <b>concepts</b> he is manipulating can be arranged before his eyes, moved, stored, recalled, operated upon according to extremely complex rules--all in very rapid response to a minimum amount of information supplied by the human, by means of special cooperative technological devices. In the limit of what we might now imagine, this could be a computer, with which we could communicate rapidly and easily, coupled to a three-dimensional color display within which it could construct extremely sophisticated images--with the computer being able to execute a wide variety of <b>process</b>es upon parts or all of these images in automatic response to human direction. The displays and <b>process</b>es could provide helpful services--we could imagine both simple and exotic varieties--and could involve <b>concepts</b> that we have never yet imagined (as the pregraphic thinker of Stage 2 would be unable to predict the bar graph, the <b>process</b> of long division, or a <b>card</b> file system).<br><br>These hypotheses imply great richness in the new evolutionary spaces opened by progressing from Stage 3 to Stage 4. We would like to study the hypotheses further, examining their possible manifestations in our experience, ways of demonstrating their validity, and possible deductions relative to going to Stage 4.<br><br>In search of some simple ways to determine what the Neo-Whorfian hypothesis might imply, we could imagine some relatively straightforward means of increasing our external symbol-manipulation capability and try to picture the consequent changes that could evolve in our language and methods of thinking. Actually, it turned out to be simpler to invert the problem and consider a change that would reduce our capability for external symbol manipulation. This allowed an empirical approach which proved both simple and effective. We thus performed the following experiment.<br><br>Brains of power equal to ours could have evolved in an environment where the combination of artifact materials and muscle strengths were so scaled that the neatest scribing tool (equivalent to a pencil, possible had a shape and mass as manageable as a brick would be to us-assuming that our muscles were not specially conditioned to deal with it. We fastened a pencil to a brick and experimented. Figure 2 shows the results, compared with typewriting and ordinary pencil writing. With the brick pencil, we are slower and less precise. If we want to hurry the writing, we have to make it larger. Also, writing the passage twice with the brick-pencil tires the untrained hand and arm.<br><br>How would our civilization have matured if this had been the only manual means for us to use in graphical manipulation of symbols? For one thing, the record keeping that enables the organization of commerce and government would probably have taken a form so different from what we know that our social structure would undoubtedly have evolved differently. Also, the effort in doing calculations and writing down extensive and carefully reasoned argument would dampen individualexperimentation with sophisticated new <b>concepts</b>, to lower the rate of learning and the rate of useful output, and perhaps to discourage a good many people from even working at extending understanding. The <b>concepts</b> that would evolve within our culture would thus be different, and very likely the symbology to represent them would be different--much more economical of motion in their writing It thus seems very likely that our thoughts and our language would be rather directly affected by the particular means used by our culture for externally manipulating symbols, which gives little intuitive substantiation to our Neo-Whorfian hypothesis.<br><br>Fig. 2: Experi<b>mental</b> Results of Tying a Brick to a Pencil to \"De-Augment\" the Individual<br><br>To reflect further upon the implications of this hypothesis, the following hypothetical artifact development can be considered, representing a diiferent type of external symbol manipulation that could have had considerable effect. Suppose that our young technology of a few generations ago had developed an artifact that was essentially a high speed, semi-automatic table-lookup device--cheap enough for almost everyone to afford and small and light enough to be carried on the person. Assume that the individual cartridges sold by manufacturers (publishers) contained the look-up information, that one cartridge could hold the equivalent of an unabridged dictionary, and that a one-paragraph definition could always be located and displayed on the face of the device by the average practised individual in less than three seconds. The fortunes of technological invention, commercial interest, and public acceptance just might have evolved something like this.<br><br>If it were so very easy to look things up, how would our vocabulary develop, how would our habits of exploring the intellectual domains of others shift, how might the sophistication of practical organization mature (if each person can so quickly and easily look up applicable rules), how would our education system change to take advantage of this new external symbol-manipulation capability of students and teachers (and administrators)?<br><br>The significance to our study of the discussion in this section lies in the perspective it gives to the ways in which human intellectual effectiveness can be affected by the particular means used by individuals for their external symbol manipulation. It seems reasonable to consider the development of automated external symbol manipulation means as a next stage in the evolution of our intellectual power.<br><br>5. Capability Repertoire Hierarchy<br><br>The concept of our H-LAM/T system possessing a repertoire of capabilities that is structured in the form of a hierarchy is most useful in our study. We shall use it in the following to tie together a number of considerations and <b>concepts</b>. There are two points of focus in considering the design of new repertoire <b>hierarchies</b>: the materials with which we have to work, and the principles by which new capability is constructed from these basic materials.<br><br>a. Basic Capabilities<br><br>\"Materials\" in this context are those capabilities in the human and in the artifact domains from which all other capabilities in the repertoire hierarchy must be constructed. Each such basic capability represents a type of functional component with which the system can be built, and a thorough job of redesigning the system calls for making an inventory of the basic capabilities available. Because we are exploring for perspective, and not yet recommending research activities, we are free to discuss and define in more detail what we mean by \"basic capability\", without regard to the amount of research involved in making an actual inventory.<br><br>The two domains, human and artifact, can be explored separately for their basic capabilities, In each we can isolate two classes of basic capability; these classes are distinguished according to whether or not the capability has been put to use within out augmentation means. The first class (those in use) can be found in a methodical manner by analyzing present capability <b>hierarchies</b>. For example, select a given capability, at any level in the hierarchy, and ask yourself if it can be usefully changed by any means that can be given consideration in the augmentation research contemplated, If it can, then it is not basic but it can be decomposed into an eventual set of basic capabilities. As you proceed down through the hierarchy, you will begin to encounter capabilities that cannot be usefully changed, and these will make up your inventory of basic capabilities. Ultimately, every such recursive decomposition of a given capability in the hierarchy will find every one of its branching paths terminated by basic capabilities. Beginning such decomposition search with different capabilities in the hierarchy will eventually uncover all of those basic capabilities used within that hierarchy or augmentation system. Many of the branching paths in the decomposition of a given higher-order capability will terminate in the same basic capability, since a given basic capability will often be used within many different higher-order capabilities.<br><br>Determining the class of basic capabilities not already utilized within existing augmentation systems requires a different exploration method. Examples of this method occur in technological research, where analytically oriented researchers search for new understandings of phenomena that can add to the research engineer's list of things to be used in the synthesis of better <b>artifacts</b>.<br><br>Before this inventorying task can be pursued in any specific instance, some criteria must be established as to what possible changes within the H-LAM/T system can be given serious consideration. For instance, some research situations might have to disallow changes which require extensive retraining, or which require undignified behavior by the human. Other situations might admit changes requiring years of special training, very expensive equipment, or the use of special drugs.<br><br>The capability for performing a certain finger action, for example, may not be basic in our sense of the word. Being able to extend the finger a certain distance would be basic but the strength and speed of a particular finger motion and its coordination with higher actions generally are usefully changeable and therefore do not represent basic capabilities. What would be basic in this case would perhaps be the <b>process</b>es whereby strength could be increased and coordinated movement patterns learned, as well as the basic movement range established by the mechanical-limit loci of the muscle-tendon-bone system. Similar capability breakdowns will occur for sensory and cognitive capabilities.<br><br>b Structure Types<br><br>1) General<br><br>The funda<b>mental</b> principle used in building sophisticated capabilities from the basic capabilities is structuring--the special type of structuring (which we have termed synergetic) in which the organization of a group of elements produces an effect greater than the mere addition of their individual effects. Perhaps \"purposeful\" structuring (or organization) would serve us as well, but since we aren't sure yet how the structuring concept must mature for our needs, we shall tentatively stick with the special modifier, \"synergetic.\" We are developing a growing awareness of the significant and pervasive nature of such structure within every physical and conceptual thing we inspect, where the hierarchical form seems almost universally present as stemming from successive levels of such organization.<br><br>The funda<b>mental</b> entities that are being structured in each and every case seems to be what we could call <b>process</b>es, where the most basic of physical <b>process</b>es (involving fields, charges, and momenta associated with the dynamics of funda<b>mental</b> particles) appear to be the hierarchical base. There are dynamic electro-optical-mechanical <b>process</b>es associated with the function of our <b>artifacts</b> (as well as metabolic, sensory, motor) and cognitive <b>process</b>es of the human, which we find to be relatively funda<b>mental</b> components within the structure of our H-LAM/T system--and each of these seems truly to be ultimately based (to our degree of understanding) upon the above mentioned basic physical <b>process</b>es. The elements that are organized to give fixed <b>structural</b> form to our physical objects--e.g., the \"element\" of tensile strength of a material-are also derived from what we could call synergetic structuring of the most basic physical <b>process</b>es.<br><br>But at the level of the capability hierarchy where we wish to work, it seems useful to us to distinguish several different types of structuring--even though each type is funda<b>mental</b>ly a structuring of the basic physical <b>process</b>es. Tentatively we have isolated five such types--although we are not sure how many we shall ultimately want to use in considering the problem of augmenting the human intellect, nor how we might divide and subdivide these different manifestations of physical-<b>process</b> structuring. We use the terms \"<b>mental</b> structuring\", \"concept structuring\", \"symbol structuring\", \"<b>process</b> structuring,\" and \"physical structuring.\"<br><br>2) Mental Structuring<br><br>Mental structuring is what we call the internal organization of conscious and unconscious <b>mental</b> images, associations, or <b>concepts</b> (or whatever it is that is organized within the human mind) that somehow manages to provide the human with understanding and the basis for such as judgment, intuition, inference, and meaningful action with respect to his environment. There is a term used in psychology, cognitive structure, which so far seems to represent just what we want for our concept of <b>mental</b> structure, but we will not adopt it until we become more sure of what the accepted psychological meaning is and of what we want for our conceptual framework.<br><br>For our present purpose, it is irrelevant to worry over what the funda<b>mental</b> <b>mental</b> \"things\" being structured are, or what mechanisms are accomplishing the structuring or making use of what has been structured. We feel reasonably safe in assuming that learning involves some kind of meaningful organization within the brain, and that whatever is so organized or structured represents the operating model of the individual's universe to the <b>mental</b> mechanisms that derive his behavior. And further, our assumption is that when the human in our H/LAM system makes the key decision or action that leads to the solution of a complex problem, it will stem from the state of his <b>mental</b> structure at that time. In this view then, the basic purpose of the system's activity on that problem up to that point has been to develop his <b>mental</b> structure to the state from which the <b>mental</b> mechanisms could derive the key action.<br><br>Our school systems attest that there are specific experiences that can be given to a human that will result in development of his <b>mental</b> structure to the point where the behavior derived there from by his <b>mental</b> mechanisms shows us that he has gained new comprehension--in other words, we can do a certain amount from outside the human toward developing his <b>mental</b> structure. Independent students and researchers also attest that internally directed behavior on the part of an individual can directly aid his structure-building <b>process</b>.<br><br>We don't know whether a <b>mental</b> structure is developed in a manner analogous to (a) development of a garden, where one provides a good environment, plants the seeds, keeps competing weeds and injurious pests out, but otherwise has to let natural <b>process</b>es take their course, or to (b) development of a basketball team, where much exercise of skills, patterns, and strategies must be provided so that natural <b>process</b>es can slowly knit together an integration, or to (c) development of a machine, where carefully formed elements are assembled in a precise, planned manner so that natural phenomena can immediately yield planned function. We don't know the <b>process</b>es, but we can and have developed empirical relationships between the experiences given a human and the associated manifestations of developing comprehension and capability, and we see the near-future course of the research toward augmenting the human's intellect as depending entirely upon empirical findings (past and future) for the development of better means to serve the development and use of <b>mental</b> structuring in the human.<br><br>We don't mean to imply by this that we renounce theories of <b>mental</b> <b>process</b>es. What we mean to emphasize is that pursuit of our objective need not wait upon the understanding of the <b>mental</b> <b>process</b>es that accomplish (what we call) <b>mental</b> structuring and that derive behavior therefrom. It would be to ignore the emphases of our own conceptual framework not to make fullest use of any theory that provided a working explanation for a group of empirical data. What's more, our entire conceptual framework represents the first pass at a \"theoretical model with which to organize our thinking and action.\"<br><br>3) Concept Structuring<br><br>Within our framework we have developed the working assumption that the manner in which we seem to be able to provide experiences that favor the development of our <b>mental</b> structures is based upon <b>concepts</b> as a \"medium of exchange.\" We view a concept as a tool that can be grasped and used by the <b>mental</b> mechanisms, that can be composed, interpreted, and used by the natural <b>mental</b> substances and <b>process</b>es. The grasping and handling done by these mechanisms can often be facilitated if the concept is given an explicit \"handle\" in the form of a representative symbol. Somehow the <b>mental</b> mechanisms can learn to manipulate images (or something) of symbols in a meaningful way and remain calmly confident that the associated conceptual manipulations are within call.<br><br>Concepts seem to be structurable, in that a new concept can be composed of an organization of established <b>concepts</b>. For present purposes, we can view a concept structure as something which we might try to develop on paper for ourselves or work with by conscious thought <b>process</b>es, or as something which we try to communicate to one another in serious discussion. We assume that, for a given unit of comprehension to be imparted, there is a concept structure (which can be consciously developed and displayed) that can be presented to an individual in such a way that it is mapped into a corresponding <b>mental</b> structure which provides the basis for that individual's \"comprehending\" behavior. Our working assumption also considers that some concept structures would be better for this purpose than others, in that they would be more easily mapped by the individual into workable <b>mental</b> structures, or in that the resulting <b>mental</b> structures enable a higher degree of comprehension and better solutions to problems, or both.<br><br>A concept structure often grows as part of a cultural evolution--either on a large scale within a large segment of society, or on a small scale within the activity domain of an individual. But it is also something that can be directly designed or modified, and a basic hypothesis of our study is that better concept structures can be developed-- structures that when mapped into a human's <b>mental</b> structure will significantly improve his capability to comprehend and to find solutions within his complex-problem situations.<br><br>A natural language provides its user with a readymade structure of <b>concepts</b> that establishes a basic <b>mental</b> structure, and that allows relatively flexible, general-purpose concept structuring. Our concept of language as one of the basic means for augmenting the human intellect embraces all of the concept structuring which the human may make use of.<br><br>4) Symbol Structuring<br><br>The other important part of our \"language\" is the way in which <b>concepts</b> are represented--the symbols and symbol structures. Words structured into phrases, sentences, paragraphs, monographs--charts, lists, diagrams, tables, etc. A given structure of <b>concepts</b> can be represented by any of an infinite number of different symbol structures, some of which would be much better than others for enabling the human perceptual and cognitive apparatus to search out and comprehend the conceptual matter of significance and/or interest to the human. For instance, a concept structure involving many numerical data would generally be much better represented with Arabic rather than Roman numerals and quite likely a graphic structure would be better than a tabular structure.<br><br>But it is not only the form of a symbol structure that is important. A problem solver is involved in a stream of conceptual activity whose course serves his <b>mental</b> needs of the moment. The sequence and nature of these needs are quite variable, and yet for each need he may benefit significantly from a form of symbol structuring that is uniquely efficient for that need.<br><br>Therefore, besides the forms of symbol structures that can be constructed and portrayed, we are very much concerned with the speed and flexibility with which one form can be transfcrmed into another, and with which new material can be located and portrayed.<br><br>We are generally used to thinking of our symbol structures as a pattern of marks on a sheet of paper. When we want a different symbol-structure view, we think of shifting our point of attention on the sheet, or moving a new sheet into position. But another kind of view might be obtained by extracting and ordering all <b>statements</b> in the local text that bear upon consideration A of the argument--or by replacing all occurrences of specified esoteric words by one's own definitions. This sort of \"view generation\" becomes quite feasible with a computer-controlled display system, and represents a very significant capability to build upon.<br><br>With a computer manipulating our symbols and generating their portrayals to us on a display, we no longer need think of our looking at the symbol structure which is stored--as we think of looking at the symbol structures stored in notebooks, memos, and books. What the computer actually stores need be none of our concern, assuming that it can portray symbol structures to us that are consistent with the form in which we think our information is structured.<br><br>A given concept structure can be represented with a symbol structure that is completely compatible with the computer's internal way of handling symbols, with all sorts of characteristics and relationships given explicit identifications that the user may never directly see. In fact, this structuring has immensely greater potential for accurately mapping a complex concept structure than does a structure an individual would find it practical to construct or use on paper.<br><br>The computer can transform back and forth between the two-dimensional portrayal on the screen, of some limited view of the total structure, and the aspect of the n-dimensional internal image that represents this \"view\". If the human adds to or modifies such a \"view,\" the computer integrates the change into the internal-image symbol structure (in terms of the computer's favored symbols and structuring) and thereby automatically detects a certain proportion of his possible conceptual inconsistencies.<br><br>Thus, inside this instrument (the computer) there is an internal-image, computer-symbol structure whose convolutions and multi-dimensionality we can learn to shape to represent to hitherto unattainable accuracy the concept structure we might be building or working with. This interna1 structure may have a form that is nearly incomprehensible to the direct inspection of a human (except in minute chunks).<br><br>But let the human specify to the instrument his particular conceptual need of the moment, relative to this internal image. Without disrupting its own internal reference structure in the slightest, the computer will effectively stretch, bend, fold, extract, and cut as it may need in order to assemble an internal <b>substructure</b> that is its respons, structured in its own internal way. With the set of standard translation rules appropriate to the situation, it portrays to the human via its display a symbol structure designed for his quick and accurate perception and comprehension of the conceptual matter pertinent to this internally composed <b>substructure</b>.<br><br>No longer does the human work on stiff and limited symbol structures, where much of the conceptual content can only be implicitly designated in an indirect and distributed fashion. These new ways of working are basically available with today's technology--we have but to free ourselves from some of our limiting views and begin experimenting with compatible sets of structure forms and <b>process</b>es for human <b>concepts</b>, human symbols, and machine symbols.<br><br>5) Process Structuring<br><br>Essentially everything that goes on within the H-LAM/T system and that is of direct interest here involves the manipulation of concept and symbol structures in service to the <b>mental</b> structure. Therefore, the <b>process</b>es within the H-LAM/T system that we are most interested in developing are those that provide for the manipulation of all three types of structure. This brings us to the fourth category of structuring, <b>process</b> structuring.<br><br>As we are currently using it, the term<br><br>includes the organization, study, modification, and execution of <b>process</b>es and <b>process</b> structures. Whereas concept structuring and symbol structuring together represent the language component of our augmentation means, <b>process</b> structuring represents the methodology component (plus a little more, actually). There has been enough previous discussion of <b>process</b> structures that we need not describe the notion here, beyond perhaps an example or two. The individual <b>process</b>es (or actions) of my hands and fingers have to be cooperatively organized if the typewriter is to do my bidding. My successive actions throughout my working day are meant to cooperate toward a certain over-all professional goal.<br><br>Many of the <b>process</b> structures are applied to the task of organizing, executing, supervising, and evaluating other <b>process</b> structures. Many of them are applied to the formation and manipulation of symbol structures (the purpose of which will often be to support the conceptual labor involved in <b>process</b> structuring).<br><br>6) Physical Structuring<br><br>Physical structuring, the last of the five types which we currently use in our conceptual framework, is nearly self-explanatory. It pretty well represents the artifact component of our augmentation means, insofar as their actual physical construction is concerned.<br><br>7) Interdependence and Regeneration<br><br>A very important feature to be noted from the discussion in this section bears upon the interdependence among the various types of structuring which are involved in the H-LAM/T system, where the capability for doing each type of structuring is dependent upon the capability for doing one or more of the other types of structuring. (Assuming that the physical structuring of the system remains basically unchanged during the system's operation, we exclude its dependence upon other factors in this discussion.)<br><br>This interdependence actually has a cyclic, regenerative nature to it which is very significant to us. We have seen how the capability for <b>mental</b> structuring is finally dependent, down the chain, upon the <b>process</b> structuring (human, artifact, composite) that enables symbol-structure manipulation. But it also is evident that the <b>process</b> structuring is dependent not only upon basic human and artifact <b>process</b> capabilities, but upon the ability of the human to learn how to execute <b>process</b>es--and no less important, upon the ability of the human to select, organize, and modify <b>process</b>es from his repertoire to structure a higher-order <b>process</b> that he can execute. </div><div id='full_4'><mark>Thus, a capability for structuring and executing <b>process</b>es is partially dependent upon the human's <b>mental</b> structuring, which in turn is partially dependent upon his <b>process</b> structuring (through concept and symbol structuring), which is partially dependent upon his <b>mental</b> structuring, etc.</mark></div><div><br><br></div><div id='full_3'><mark>All of this means that a significant improvement in symbol-structure manipulation through better <b>process</b> structuring (initially perhaps through much better <b>artifacts</b>) should enable us to develop improvements in concept and <b>mental</b>-structure manipulations that can in turn enable us to organize and execute symbol-manipulation <b>process</b>es of increased power.</mark></div><div> To most people who initially consider the possibilities for computer-like devices augmenting the human intellect, it is only the one-pass improvement that comes to mind, which presents a picture that is relatively barren compared to that which emerges when one considers this regenerative interaction.<br><br>We can confidently expect the development of much more powerful <b>concepts</b> pertaining to the manner in which symbol structures can be manipulated and portrayed, and correspondingly more complex manipulation <b>process</b>es that in the first pass would have been beyond the human's power to organize and execute without the better symbol, concept, and <b>mental</b> structuring which his augmented system provided him. These new <b>concepts</b> and <b>process</b>es, beyond our present capabilities to use and thus never developed, will provide a tremendous increased-capability payoff in the future development of our augmentation means.<br><br>c. Roles and Levels<br><br>In the repertoire hierarchy of capabilities possessed by the H-LAM/T system, the human contributes many types of capability that represent a wide variety of roles. At one time or another he will be the policy maker, the goal setter, the performance supervisor, the work scheduler, the professional specialist, the clerk, the janitor, the entrepreneur, and the proprietor (or at least a major stockholder) of the system. In the midst of some complex <b>process</b>, in fact, he may well be playing several roles concurrently--or at least have the responsibility of the roles. For instance, usually he must be aware of his progress toward a goal (supervisor), he must be alert to the possibilities for changing the goal (policy maker, planner), and he must keep records for these and other roles (clerk).<br><br>Consider a given capability (Capability 1) at some level in the repertoire hierarchy. There seems to be a sort of standard grouping of lower-order capabilities from which this is composed, and these exist in two classes--what we might call the executive class and what we might call the direct-contributive class. In the executive class of capabilities we find those used for comprehending, planning, and executing the <b>process</b> represented by Capability 1. In the direct-contributive class we find the capabilities organized by the executive class toward the direct realization of Capability 1. For example, when my telephone rings, I execute the direct-contributive <b>process</b>es of picking up the receiver and saying hello. It was the executive <b>process</b>es that comprehended the situation, directed a lower-order executive-<b>process</b> that the receiver be picked up and, when the receiver was in place (first <b>process</b> accomplished), directed the next <b>process</b>, the saying hello. That represents the composition of my capability for answering the phone.<br><br>For a low-level capability, such as that of writing a word with a pencil, both the executive and the direct-contributive sub<b>process</b>es during actual execution would be automatic. This type of automatic capability need only be summoned by a higher executive <b>process</b> in order for trained automatic responses to execute it.<br><br>At a little higher level of capability, more of the conscious conceptual and executive capabilities become involved. To call someone on the telephone, I must consciously comprehend the need for this <b>process</b> and how I can execute it, I must consciously pick up the directory and search for the name and telephone number, and I must consciously direct the dialing of the number.<br><br>At a still higher level of capability, the executive capabilities must have a degree of power that unaided <b>mental</b> capabilities cannot provide. In such a case, one might make a list of steps and check each item off as it is executed. For an even more complex <b>process</b>, comprehending the particular situation in which it is to be executed, even before beginning to plan the execution, may take months of labor and a very complex organization of the system's capabilities.<br><br>Imagining a <b>process</b> as complex as the last example brings us to the realization that at any particular moment the H-LAM/T system may be in the middle of executing a great number of <b>process</b>es. Assume that the human is in the middle of the <b>process</b> of making a telephone call. That telephone call is a sub<b>process</b> in the middle of the <b>process</b> of calling a committee meeting. But calling a committee meeting is a sub<b>process</b> in the middle of the <b>process</b> of determining a budgetary policy, which is in turn but a sub<b>process</b> in the middle of the <b>process</b> of estimating manpower needs, and so on.<br><br>Not only does the human need to play various roles (sometimes concurrently) in the execution of any given <b>process</b>, but he is playing these roles for the many concurrent <b>process</b>es that are being executed at different levels. This situation is typical for any of us engaged in reasonably demanding types of professional pursuits, and yet we have never received explicit training in optimum ways of carrying out any but a very few of the roles at a very few of the levels. A well-designed H-LAM/T system would provide explicit and effective <b>concepts</b>, terms, equipment, and methods for all these roles, and for their dynamic coordination.<br><br>d. Model of Executive Superstructure<br><br>It is the repertoire hierarchy of <b>process</b> capabilities upon which the ultimate capability of the H-LAM/T system rests. This repertoire hierarchy is rather like a mountain of white-collar talent that sits atop and controls the talents of the workers. We can illustrate this executive superstructure by considering it as though it were a network of contractors and subcontractors in which each capability in the repertoire hierarchy is represented by an independent contractor whose mode of operation is to do the planning, make up specifications, subcontract the actual work, and supervise the performance of his subcontractors. This means that each subcontractor does the same thing in his turn. At the bottom of this hierarchy are those independent contractors who do actual \"production work.\"<br><br>If by some magical <b>process</b> the production workers could still know just what to do and when to do it even though the superstructure of contractors was removed from above them, no one would know the difference. The executive superstructure is necessary because humans do not operate by magic, but even a necessary superstructure is a burden. We can readily recognize that there are many ways to organize and manage such a superstructure, resulting in vastly different degrees of efficiency in the application of the workers' talents.<br><br>Suppose that the activity of the production workers was of the same nature as the activity of the different contractors, and that this activity consisted of gaining comprehension and solving problems. And suppose that there was only so much applicable talent available to the total system. The question now becomes how to distribute that talent between superstructure and workers to get the most total production. The efficiency of organization within the superstructure is now doubly important so that a minimum of talent in the superstructure produces a maximum of organizational efficiency in directing the productivity of the remaining talent.<br><br>In the situation where talent is limited, we find a close parallel to our H-LAM/T system in its pursuit of comprehension and problem solutions. We obtain an even closer parallel if we say that the thinking, planning, supervising, record keeping, etc., for each contractor is actually done by a single individual for the whole superstructure, time- sharing his attention and talents over these many tasks. Today this individual cannot be depended upon to have any special training for many of these roles; he is likely to have learned them by cut and try and by indirect imitation.<br><br>A complex <b>process</b> is often executed by the H-LAM/T system in a multi-pass fashion (i.e., cut and try). In really complex situations, comprehension and problem solutions do not stand waiting at the end of a straightforward path; instead, possibilities open up and plans shift as comprehension grows. In the model using a network of contractors, this type of procedure would entail a great deal of extra work within the superstructure--each contractor involved in the <b>process</b> would have the specifications upon which he bid continually changed, and would continually have to respond to the changes by restudying the situation, changing his plans, changing the specifications to his subcontractors, and changing his records. This is a terrific additional burden, but it allows a freedom of action that has tremendous importance to the effectiveness the system exhibits to the outside world.<br><br>We could expect significant gains from automating the H- LAM/T system if a computer could do nothing more than increase the effectiveness of the executive <b>process</b>es. More human time, energy, and productive thought could be allocated to direct-contributive <b>process</b>es, which would be coordinated in a more sophisticated, flexible and efficient manner. But there is every reason to believe that the possibilities for much-improved symbol and <b>process</b> structuring that would stem from this automation will directly provide improvements in both the executive and direct-contributive <b>process</b>es in the system.<br><br>e. Flexibility in the Executive Role<br><br>The executive superstructure is a necessary component in the H-LAM/T system, and there is finite human capability which must be divided between executive and direct-contributive activities. An important aspect of the multi-role activity of the human in the system is the development and manipulation of the symbol structures associated with both his direct-contributive roles and his executive roles.<br><br>When the system encounters a complex situation in which comprehension and problem solutions are being pursued, the direct-contributive roles require the development of symbol structures that portray the <b>concepts</b> involved within the situation. But executive roles in a complex problem situation also require conceptual activity--e.g., comprehension, selection, supervision--that can benefit from well-designed symbol structures and fast, flexible means for manipulating and displaying them. For complex <b>process</b>es, the executive problem posed to the human (of gaining the necessary comprehension and making a good plan) may be tougher than the problem he faced in the role of direct-contributive worker. If the flexibility desired for the <b>process</b> <b>hierarchies</b> (to make room for human cut-and-try methods) is not to be degraded or abandoned, the executive activity will have to be provided with fast and flexible symbol-structuring techniques.<br><br>The means available to humans today for developing and manipulating these symbol structures are both laborious and inflexible. It is hard enough to develop an initial structure of diagrams and text, but the amount of effort required to make changes is often prohibitively great; one settles for inflexibility. Also, the kind of generous flexibility that would be truly helpful calls for added symbol structuring just to keep track of the trials, branches, and reasoning thereto that are involved in the development of the subject structure; our present symbol-manipulation means would very soon bog down completely among the complexities that are involved in being more than just a little bit flexible.<br><br>We find that the humans in our H-LAM/T systems are essential working continuously within a symbol structure of some sort, shifting their attention from one structure to another as they guide and execute the <b>process</b>es that ultimately provide them with the comprehension and the problem solutions that they seek. This view increases our respect for the essential importance of the basic capability of composing and modifying efficient symbol structures. Such a capability depends heavily upon the particular <b>concepts</b> that are isolated and manipulated as entities, upon the symbology used to represent them, upon the <b>artifacts</b> that help to manipulate and display the symbols, and upon the methodology for developing and using symbol structures. In other words, this capability depends heavily upon proper language, <b>artifacts</b>, and methodology, our basic augmentation means.<br><br>When the course of action must respond to new comprehension, new insights and new intuitive flashes of possible explanations or solutions, it will not be an orderly <b>process</b>. Existing means of composing and working with symbol structures penalize disorderly <b>process</b>es very heavily, and it is part of the real promise in the automated H-LAM/T systems of tomorrow that the human can have the freedom and power of disorderly <b>process</b>es.<br><br>f. Compound Effects<br><br>Since many <b>process</b>es in many levels of the hierarchy are involved in the execution of a single higher-level <b>process</b> of the system, any factor that influences <b>process</b> execution in general will have a highly compounded total effect upon the system's performance. There are several such factors which merit special attention.<br><br>Basic human cognitive powers, such as memory intelligence, or pattern perception can have such a compounded effect. The augmentation means employed today have generally evolved among large statistical populations, and no attempt has been made to fit them to individual needs and abilities. Each individual tends to evolve his own variations, but there is not enough mutation and selection activity, nor enough selection feedback, to permit very significant changes. A good, automated H-LAM/T system should provide the opportunity for a significant adaptation of the augmentation means to individual characteristics. The compounding effect of funda<b>mental</b> human cognitive powers suggests further that systems designed for maximum effectiveness would require that these powers be developed as fully as possible--by training, special <b>mental</b> tricks, improved language, new methodology.<br><br>In the automated system that we contemplate, the human should be able to draw on explicit-artifact <b>process</b> capability at many levels in the repertoire hierarchy; today, <b>artifacts</b> are involved explicitly in only the lower-order capabilities. In the future systems, for instance, it should be possible to have computer <b>process</b>es provide direct and significant help in his <b>process</b>es at many levels. We thus expect the effect of the computer in the system to be very much compounded. A great deal of richness in the future possibilities for automated H-LAM/T systems is implied here--considerably more than many people realize who would picture the computer as just helping them do the things they do now. This type of compounding is related to the reverberating waves of change discussed in Section II-A.<br><br>Another factor can exert this type of compound effect upon over-all system performance: the human's unconscious <b>process</b>es. Clinical psychology seems to provide clear evidence that a large proportion of a human's everyday activity is significantly mediated or basically prompted by unconscious <b>mental</b> <b>process</b>es that, although \"natura\" in a functional sense, are not rational. The observable mechanisms of these <b>process</b>es (observable by another, trained person) includes masking of the irrationality of the human's actions which are so affected, so that few of us will admit that our actions might be irrational, and most of us can construct satisfying rationales for any action that may be challenged.<br><br>Anything that might have so general an effect upon our <b>mental</b> actions as is implied here, is certainly a candidate for ultimate consideration in the continuing development of our intellectual effectiveness. It may be that the first stages of research on augmenting the human intellect will have to proceed without being able to do anything about this problem except accommodate to it as well as possible. This may be one of the very significant problems whose solution awaits our development of increased intellectual effectiveness.<br><br>III. EXAMPLES AND DISCUSSION<br><br>A. BACKGROUND<br><br>The conceptual structure which we have evolved to orient and guide the pursuit of increasing man's intellectual effectiveness has been des cribed in the foregoing sections in a rather general and abstract fashion. In this section we shall try to develop more concrete images of these <b>concepts</b>, of some of the future possibilities for augmentation, and of the relationship between these different <b>concepts</b> and possibilities.<br><br>It must be borne in mind that a great deal of study and invention is yet to be done in developing the improved augmentation means that are bound to come, and that the examples which we present in this report are intended only to show what is meant by the generalizations which we use, and to provide a feeling on the part of the reader for the richness and power of the improvements we can likely develop in our augmentation means. Many of the examples are realizable today (in fact, some have been realized) and most of the rest are reasonably straight forward extrapolations into the near future. We predict that what actually develops in the new augmentation means will be consistent with our conceptual framework, but that the particulars will be full of surprises.<br><br>Each of the examples will show a facet of how the little steps that the human can take with his sensory-<b>mental</b>-motor apparatus can be organized cooperatively with the capabilities of <b>artifacts</b> to accomplish significant things in the way of achieving comprehension and solving problems. This organization, as we have shown in Section II, can be viewed as the five different types of structuring which we outlined, where much of the structuring that goes on in the human's total problem solving activity is for the purpose of building a <b>mental</b> structure which in a way \"puts the human up where he can see what is going on and can point the direction to move next.\"<br><br>An early paper, offering suggestions toward augmenting the human intellect, that fits well and significantly within the framework which we have developed was written by Vannevar Bush (6) in 1945. Indeed, it fits so well, and states its points so nicely, thst it was deemed appropriate to our purpose here to summarize it in detail and to quote from it at considerable length.<br><br>1. What Vannevar Bush proposed in 1945<br><br>He wrote as World War II was coming to an end, and his principal purpose seemed to be to offer new professional objectives to those scientists who were soon to be freed from war-motivated research and development. It would seem that he also wished to induce a general recognition of a growing problem--storage, retrieval, and manipulation of information for and by intellectual workers--and to show the possibilities he foresaw for scientific development of equipment which could significantly aid such workers in facing this problem. He summarized the situation: \"...There is a growing mountain of research...The investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions of thousands of other workers. Professionally our methods of transmitting and reviewing the results of research are generations old...truly significant attainments become lost in the mass of the inconsequential...The summation of human experience is being expanded at a prodigious rate, and the means we use for threading through the consequent maze to the momentarily important item is the same as was used in the days of square-rigged ships.\"<br><br>Then he brought out some general considerations for hope: \".. But there are signs of a change as new and powerful instru<b>mental</b>ities come into use...Photocells...advanced photography...thermionic tubes... cathode ray tubes...relay combinations...there are plenty of mechanical aids with which to effect a transformation in scientific records.\" And he points out that devices which we commonly use today--e.g., a calculating machine or an automobile--would have been impossibly expensive to produce in earlier eras of our technological development. \"...The world has arrived at an age of cheap complex devices of great reliability and something is bound to come of it.\"<br><br>In six and a half pages crammed full of well-based speculations, Bush proceeds to outline enough plausible artifact and methodology developments to make a very convincing case for the augmentation of the individual intellectual worker. Extension of existing photographic techniques to give each individual a continuously available miniature camera for recording anything in view and of interest, and to realize a high-quality 100:1 linear reduction ratio for micro-record files for these photographs and published material; voice-recognition equipment (perhaps requiring a special language) to ease the <b>process</b> of entering new self-generated material into the written record--these are to provide the individual with information-generating aid.<br><br>For the detailed manipulation of mathematical and logical expressions, Bush projects computing aids (which have been surpassed by subsequent development) that allow the individual to exercise a greater proportion of his time and talents in the tasks of selecting data and the appropriate transformations and <b>process</b>es which are to be executed, leaving to the machinery the subsequent execution. He suggests that new notation for our verbal symbols (perhaps binary) could allow character recognition devices to help even further in the information-manipulation area, and also points out that poor symbolism (\"...the exceedingly crude way in which mathematicians express their relationships. They employ a symbolism which grew like Topsy and has little consistency; a strange fact in that most logical field.\") stands in the way of full realization of machine help for the manipulations associated with the human's real time <b>process</b> of mathematical work. And \"...Then, on beyond the strict logic of the mathematician, lies the application of logic in everyday affairs. We may some day click off arguments on a machine with the same assurance that we now enter sales on a cash register.\"<br><br>Then \" ..So much for the manipulation of ideas and their insertion into the record. Thus far we seem to be worse off than before--for we can enormously extend the record; yet even in its present bulk we can hardly consult it. This is a much larger matter than merely the extraction of data for the purposes of scientific research; it involves the entire <b>process</b> by which man profits by his inheritance of acquired knowledge The prime action of use is selection, and here we are halting indeed. There may be millions of fine thoughts, and the account of the experience on which they are based, all encased within stone walls of acceptable architectural form; but if the scholar can get at only one a week by diligent search, his syntheses are not likely to keep up with the current scene.\" He goes on to discuss possible developments that could allow very rapid (in the human's time frame) selection of unit records from a very large file--where the records could be dry-<b>process</b> photographic micro-images upon which the user could add lnformation at will.<br><br>Bush goes on to say, \"The real heart of the matter of selection, however, goes deeper than a lag in the adoption of mechanisms...Our ineptitude in getting at the record is largely caused by the artificiality of systems of indexing.\" He observes the power of the associative recall which human memory exhibits, and proposes that a mechanization of selection by association could be realized to considerable advantage. He spends the last two pages (a quarter of his article) describing a device embodying this capability, and points out some features of its use and of its likely effect. This material is so relevant and so well put that I quote it in its entirety:<br><br>\"Consider a future device for individual use, which is a sort of mechanized private file and library. It needs a name, and to coin one at random, \"<b>memex</b>\" will do. A <b>memex</b> is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.<br><br>\"It consists of a desk, and while it can presumably be operated from a distance, it is primarily the piece of furniture at which he works. On the top are slanting translucent screens, on which material can be projected for convenient reading. There is a keyboard, and sets of buttons and levers. Otherwise it looks like an ordinary desk.<br><br>\"In one end is the stored material. The matter of bulk is well taken care of by improved microfilm. Only a small part of the interior of the <b>memex</b> is devoted to storage, the rest to mechanism. Yet if the user inserted 5000 pages of material a day it would take him hundreds of years to fill the repository, so he can be profligate and enter material freely.<br><br>\"Most of the <b>memex</b> contents are purchased on microfilm ready for insertion. Books of all sorts, pictures, current periodicals, newspapers, are thus obtained and dropped into place. Business correspondence takes the same path. And there is provision for direct entry. On the top of the <b>memex</b> is a transparent platen. On this are placed longhand notes, photographs, memoranda, all sort of things. When one is in place, the depression of a lever causes it to be photographed onto the next blank space in a section of the <b>memex</b> film, dry photography being employed.<br><br>\"There is, of course, provision for consultation of the record by the usual scheme of indexing. If the user wishes to consult a certain book, he taps its code on the keyboard, and the title page of the book promptly appears before him, projected onto one of his viewing positions. Frequently-used codes are mnemonic, so that he seldom consults his code book; but when he does, a single tap of a key projects it for his use. Moreover, he has supple<b>mental</b> levers. On deflecting one of these levers to the right he runs through the book before him, each page in turn being projected at a speed which just allows a recognizing glance at each. If he deflects it further to the right, he steps through the book 10 pages at a time; still further at 100 pages at a time. Deflection to the left gives him the same control backwards.<br><br>\"A special button transfers him immediately to the first page of the index. Any given book of his library can thus be called up and consulted with far greater facility than if it were taken from a shelf. As he has several projection positions, he can leave one item in position while he calls up another. He can add marginal notes and comments, taking advantage of one possible type of dry photography, and it could even be arranged so that he can do this by a stylus scheme, such as is now employed in the telautograph seen in railroad waiting rooms, just as though he had the physical page before him.<br><br>\"All this is conventional, except for the projection forward of present-day mechanisms and gadgetry. If affords an immediate step, however, to associative indexing, the basic idea of which is a provision whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another. This is the essential feature of the <b>memex</b>. The <b>process</b> of tying two items together is the important thing.<br><br>\"When the user is building a trail, he names it, inserts the name in his code book, and taps it out on his keyboard. Before him are the two items to be joined, projected onto adjacent viewing positions. At the bottom of each there are a number of blank code spaces, and a pointer is set to indicate one of these on each item. The user taps a single key, and the items are permanently joined. In each code space appears the code word. Out of view, but also in the code space, is inserted a set of dots for photocell viewing; and on each item these dots by their positions designate the index number of the other item.<br><br>\"Thereafter, at any time, when one of these items is in view, the other can be instantly recalled merely by tapping a button below the corresponding code space. Moreover, when numerous items have been thus joined together to form a trail, they can be reviewed in turn, rapidly or slowly, by deflecting a lever like that used for turning the pages of a book. It is exactly as though the physical items had been gathered together to form a new book. It is more than this, for any item can be joined into numerous <b>trails</b>.<br><br>\"The owner of the <b>memex</b>, let us say, is interested in the origin and properties of the bow and arrow. Specifically he is studying why the short Turkish bow was apparently superior to the English long bow in the skirmishes of the Crusades. He has dozens of possibly pertinent books and articles in his <b>memex</b>. First he runs through an encyclopedia, finds and interesting but sketchy article, leaves it projected, Next, in a history, he finds another pertinent item, and ties the two together. Thus he goes, building a trail of many items. Occasionally he inserts a comment of his own, either linking it into the main trail or joining it by a side trail to a particular item. When it becomes evident that the elastic properties of available materials had a great deal to do with the bow, he branches off on a side trail which takes him through textbooks on elasticity and tables of physical constants. He inserts a page of longhand analysis of his own. Thus he builds a trail of his interest through the maze of materials available to him.<br><br>\"And his <b>trails</b> do not fade. Several years later, his talk with a friend turns to the queer ways in which a people resist innovations, even of vital interest. He has an example, in the fact that the outranged Europeans still failed to adopt the Turkish bow. In fact he has a trail on it. A touch brings up the code book. Tapping a few keys projects the head of the trail. A lever runs through it at will, stopping at interesting items, going off on side excursions. It is an interesting trail, pertinent to the discussion. So he sets a reproducer in action, photographs the whole trail out, and passes it to his friend for insertion in his own <b>memex</b>, there to be linked into the more general trail.<br><br>\"Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready-made with a mesh of associative <b>trails</b> running through them, ready to be dropped into the <b>memex</b> and there amplified. The lawyer has at his touch the associated opinions and decisions of his whole experience, and of the experience of friends and authorities. The patent attorney has on call the millions of issued patents, with familiar <b>trails</b> to every point of his client's interest. The physician, puzzled by its patient's reactions, strikes the trail established in studying an earlier similar case, and runs rapidly through analogous case histories, with side references to the classics for the pertinent anatomy and histology. The chemist, struggling with the synthesis of an organic compound, has all the chemical literature before him in his laboratory, with <b>trails</b> following the analogies of compounds, and side <b>trails</b> to their physical and chemical behavior.<br><br>\"The historian, with a vast chronological account of a people, parallels it with a skip trail which stops only at the salient items, and can follow at any time contemporary <b>trails</b> which lead him all over civilization at a particular epoch. There is a new profession of trail blazers, those who find delight in the task of establishing useful <b>trails</b> through the enormous mass of the common record. The inheritance from the master becomes, not only his additions to the world's record, but for his disciples the entire scaffolding by which they were erected.<br><br>\"Thus science may implement the ways in which man produces, stores, and consults the record of the race. It might be striking to outline the instru<b>mental</b>ities of the future more spectacularly, rather than to stick closely to the methods and elements now known and undergoing rapid development, as has been done here. Technical difficulties of all sorts have been ignored, certainly, but also ignored are means as yet unknown which may come any day to accelerate technical progress as violently as did the advent of the thermionic tube. In order that the picture may not be too commonplace, by reason of sticking to present-day patterns, it may be well to mention one such possibility, not to prophesy but merely to suggest, for prophecy based on extension of the known has substance, while prophecy founded on the unknown is only a doubly involved guess.<br><br>\"All our steps in creating or absorbing material of the record proceed through one of the senses - the tactile when we touch keys, the oral when we speak or listen, the visual when we read. Is it not possible that some day the path may be established more directly?<br><br>\"We know that when the eye sees, all the consequent information is transmitted to the brain by means of electrical vibrations in the channel of the optic nerve. This is an exact analogy with the electrical vibrations which occur in the cable of a television set: they convey the picture from the photocells which see it to the radio transmitter from which it is broadcast. We know further that if we can approach that cable with the proper instruments, we do not need to touch it; we can pick up those vibrations by electrical induction and thus discover and reproduce the scene which is being transmitted, just as a telephone wire may be tapped for its message.<br><br>\"The impulse which flow in the arm nerves of a typist convey to her fingers the translated information which reaches her eye or ear, in order that the fingers may be caused to strike the proper keys. Might not these currents be intercepted, either in the original form in which information is conveyed to the brain, or in the marvelously metamorphosed form in which they then proceed to the hand?<br><br>\"By bone conduction we already introduce sounds into the nerve channels of the deaf in order that they may hear. Is it not possible that we may learn to introduce them without the present cumbersomeness of first transforming electrical vibrations to mechanical ones, which the human mechanism promptly transforms back to the electrical form? With a couple of electrodes on the skull the encephalograph now produces pen-and-ink traces which bear some relation to the electrical phenomena going on in the brain itself. True, the record is unintelligible, except as it points out certain gross misfunctioning of the cerebral mechanism; but who would now place bounds on where such a thing may lead?<br><br>\"In the outside world, all forms of intelligence, whether of sound or sight, have been reduced to the form of varying currents in an electric circuit in order that they may be transmitted. Inside the human frame exactly the same sort of <b>process</b> occurs. Must we always transform to mechanical movements in order to proceed from one electrical phenomenon to another? It is a suggestive thought, but it hardly warrants prediction without losing touch with reality and immediateness.<br><br>\"Presumably man's spirit should be elevated if he can better review his shady past and analyze more completely and objectively his present problems. He has built a civilization so complex that he needs to mechanize his record more fully if he is to push his experiment to its logical conclusion and not merely become bogged down part way there by overtaxing his limited memory. His excursion may be more enjoyable if he can reacquire the privilege of forgetting the manifold things he does not need to have immediately at hand, with some assurance that he can find them again if they prove important.<br><br>\"The applications of science have built man a well-supplied house, and are teaching him to live healthily therein. They have enabled him to throw masses of people against another with cruel weapons. They may yet allow him truly to encompass the great record and to grow in the wisdom of race experience. He may perish in conflict before he learns to wield that record for his true good. Yet, in the application of science to the needs and desires of man, it would seem to be a singularly unfortunate stage at which to terminate the <b>process</b>, or to lose hope as to the outcome.<br><br>2. Comments Related to Bush's Article<br><br>There are many significant items in the article, but the main ones upon which we shall comment here will be those relative to the use and implications of his Memex. The associative <b>trails</b> whose establishment and use within the files he describes at some length provide a beautiful example of a new capsbility in symbol structuring that derives from new artifact-<b>process</b> capability, and that provides new ways to develop and portray concept structures. </div><div id='full_1'><mark>Any file is a symbol structure whose purpose is to represent a variety of <b>concepts</b> and concept structures in a way that makes them maximally available and useful to the needs of the human's <b>mental</b>-structure development -- within the limits imposed by the capability of the <b>artifacts</b> and human for jointly executing <b>process</b>es of symbol-structure manipulation.</mark></div><div> The Memex allows a human user to do more conveniently (less energy, more quickly) what he could have done with relatively ordinary photographic equipment and filing systems, but he would have had to spend so much time in the lower-level <b>process</b>es of manipulation that his <b>mental</b> time constants of memory and patience would have rendered the system unusable in the detailed and intimate sense which Bush illustrates.<br><br>The Memex adds a factor of speed and convenience to ordinary filing-system (symbol-structuring) <b>process</b>es that would encourage new methods of work by the user, and it also adds speed and convenience for <b>process</b>es not generally used before. Making it easy to establish and follow the associative <b>trails</b> makes practical a new symbol-structuring <b>process</b> whose use can make a significant difference in the concept structuring and basic methods of work. It is also probable that clever usage of associative-trail manipulation can augment the human's <b>process</b> structuring and executing capacilities so that he could successfully make use of even more powerful symbol-structure manlpulation <b>process</b>es utilizing the Memex capabilities. An example of this general sort of thing was given by Bush where he points out that the file index can be called to view at the push of a button, which implicitly provides greater capability to work within more sophisticated and complex indexing systems<br><br>Note, too, the implications extending from Bush's mention of one user duplicating a trail (a portion of his structure) and giving it to a friend who can put it into his Memex and integrate it into his own trail (structure). Also note the \"wholly new forms of encyclopedia\", the profession of \"trail blazers,\" and the inheritance from a master including \"the entire scaffolding\" by which such additions to the world's record were erected. These illustrate the types of changes in the ways in which people can cooperate intellectually that can emerge from the augmentation of the individuals. This type of change represents a very significant part of the potential value in pursuing research directly on the means for making individuals intellectually more effective.<br><br>3. Some Possibilities with Cards and Relatively Simple Equipment<br><br>A number of useful new structuring <b>process</b>es can be made available to an individual through development and use of relatively simple equipment that is mostly electromechanical in nature and relatively cheap. We can begin developing examples of this by describing the hand operated, edge-notched <b>card</b> system that I developed and used over the past eight years.<br><br>a. An Existing Note and File System<br><br>The \"unit records\" here, unlike those in the Memex example, are generally scraps of typed or handwritten text on IBM-<b>card</b> sized edge-notchable <b>card</b>s. These represent little \"kernels\" of data, thought, fact, considerationJ <b>concepts</b>, ideas, worries, etc., that are relevant to a given problem area in my professional life. Each such specific problem area has its note<b>card</b>s kept in a separate deck, and for each such deck there is a master <b>card</b> with descriptors associated with individual holes about the periphery of the <b>card</b>. There is a field of holes reserved for notch coding the <b>serial</b> number of a reference from which the note on a <b>card</b> may have been taken, or the <b>serial</b> number corresponding to an individual from whom the information came directly (including a code for myself, for self-generated thoughts).<br><br>None of the principles of indexing or sorting used here is new: coordinate-indexing descriptors with direct coding on edge notched <b>card</b>s, with needle-sort retrieval. Mainly what is new is the use of the smaller units of information, in restricted-subject sets (notedecks) so that I gain considerable flexibility in the manipulations of my thought products at the level at which I actually work in my minute-by-minute struggle with analytical and formulative thought. Not only do my own thoughts produce results in this fashion, but when I digest the writings of another person, I find generally anyway that I have extracted from his structure and integrated into my own a specific selection of facts, considerations, ideas, etc. Often these different extracted items fit into different places in my structure, or become encased in special <b>substructure</b>s as I modify or expand his <b>concepts</b>. Extracting such items or kernels and putting each on its own note<b>card</b> helps this <b>process</b> considerably--the role or position of each such item in the growth of the note structure is independent, and yet if desired all can quickly be isolated and extracted by simple needle sorting on the reference-number notching field.<br><br>These note<b>card</b>s represent much more than just an in formation file. They provide a workspace for me, in which I can browse, make additions or corrections, or build new sets of thought kernels with a good deal of freedom. I can leave notes with suggestions or questions for myself that will drop out at an appropriate later time. I can do document-reference searches with good efficiency, too, by needle sorting for notes within relevant descriptor categories Any note<b>card</b> with relevant notes on it points to the original source (by the source <b>serial</b> number, which I always write, together with the page, at the top of the <b>card</b>). When I am in the <b>process</b> of developing an integrated writeup covering some or all of the notedeck'g material, I can quickly needle out a set of <b>card</b>s relevant to the topic under consideration at the moment--with all other <b>card</b>s in one pile to the side--and I need do a very minimum of hand searching or stacking in special little category piles. If I utilize specific information from another person, I can register my acknowledgment in my draft writeup merely by writing in the source <b>serial</b> number that is at the top of the note<b>card</b>--it is a straight forward clerical job for a secretary later to arrange footnote entries and numbering.<br><br>b. Comments on the System<br><br>First, let me relate what has been described to the special terms brought out in previous sections. The writing contained on each note<b>card</b> is a small-sized symbol structure, representing or portraying to me a small structure of <b>concepts</b>. The notches on the edges of the <b>card</b>s are symbols that serve to tie these <b>card</b>-sized symbol sub structures into a large symbol structure (the notedeck). One aspect of the structure is the physical grouping of the <b>card</b>s at a given time-- which happens to be the only aspect of the over-all structuring that my human capabilities can make direct use of--and in this respect I can execute <b>process</b>es which produce restructuring (that is, physical re grouping) that helps me considerably to perceive and assimilate the <b>concepts</b> of worth to me. This restructuring is effected by composite <b>process</b>es involving me, a master code <b>card</b>, a sorting needle, and a work surface. I can add to the symbol structure by executing other composite <b>process</b>es which involve me, writing instruments (pen, pencil, or type writer), a master code <b>card</b>, and a <b>card</b> notcher.<br><br>If my <b>mental</b> <b>process</b>es were more powerful, I could dispense with the <b>card</b>s, and hold all of the <b>card</b>-sized concept structures in my memory, where also would be held the categorization linkages that evolved as I worked (with my feet up on the <b>artifacts</b> and my eyes closed). As it is, and as it probably always will be no matter how we develop or train our <b>mental</b> capabilities, I want to work in problem areas where the number and interrelationship complexity of the individual factors involved are too much for me to hold and manipulate within my mind. So, my mind develops conscious sets of <b>concepts</b>, or recognizes and selects them from what it perceives in the work of others, and it directs the organization of an external symbol structure in which can be held and portrayed to the mind those <b>concepts</b> I cannot (reliably) remember or whose manipulations I cannot visualize. The price I pay for this augmentation shows up in the time and energy involved in manipulating <b>artifacts</b> to manipulate symbols to give me this artificial memory and visualization of <b>concepts</b> and their manipulation.<br><br>c. Associative-Linking Possibilities<br><br>But let us go further with discussing specific examples of means for augmenting our intellects. In using the edge-notched-<b>card</b> system described, I found several types of structuring which that system could not provide, but which would both be very useful and probably ob tainable with reasonably practical artifact means. One need arose quite commonly as trains of thought would develop on a growing series of note <b>card</b>s. There was no convenient way to link these <b>card</b>s together so that the train of thought could later be recalled by extracting the ordered series of note<b>card</b>s. An associative-trail scheme similar to that out lined by Bush for his Memex could conceivably be implemented with these <b>card</b>s to meet this need and add a valuable new symbol-structuring <b>process</b> to the system. Straightforward engineering development could provide a mechanism that would be able to select a specific <b>card</b> from a relatively large deck by a parallel edge-notch sort on a unique <b>serial</b> number notched into each <b>card</b>, and the search mechanism could be set up automatically by a hole sensing mechanism from internal punches on another <b>card</b> that was placed in the sensing slot. An auxiliary notching mechanism could automatically give succeeding <b>serial</b>-number encoding to new note<b>card</b>s as they are made up.<br><br>Suppose that one wants to link Card B to Card A, to make a trail from A to B. He puts Card B into a slot so that the edge-notched coding of the <b>card</b>'s <b>serial</b> number can automatically be sensed, and slips Card A under a hole-punching head which duplicates the <b>serial</b>-number code of Card B in the coding of the holes punched in a speciflc zone on Card A. Later, when he may have discovered Card A, and wishes to follow this particular associative trail to the next <b>card</b>, he aligns that zone on Card A under a hole-sensing head which reads the <b>serial</b> number for Card B therein and automatically sets up the sorting mechanism. A very quick and simple human <b>process</b> thus initiates the automatic extraction of the next item on the associative trail. It's not unreasonable to assume that establishing a link would take about three seconds, and tracing a link to the next <b>card</b> about three to five seconds.<br><br>There would still be descriptor-code notching and selection to provide for general grouping classifications--and we can see that the system could really provide a means for working within the structure of the contained information.<br><br>d. An Experiment Illustrating Usage and Further System Possibilities<br><br>I once tried to use my <b>card</b>s, with their separate little \"concept packets,\" in the <b>process</b> of developing a file memo outlining the status and plans of a research project. I first developed a set of <b>card</b>s upon each of which I described a separate consideration, possibility, or specification about the memo--in the disorderly sequence in which they occurred to me as my thoughts about the basic features of the memo evolved. Right off the bat I noticed that there were two distinct groups--some ideas were about what the memo ought to accomplish, what time period it should cover, when it should be finished, what level and style of presentation should be used, etc., and some ideas were about the sub ject of the memo. As more thoughts developed, I found that the latter group also divided into ideas representing possible content and those representing possible organization.<br><br>I separated the <b>card</b>s into three corresponding groups (which I shall call Specification, Organization, and Content), and began to organize each of them. I started with the Specification group (it being the \"highest\" in nature), and immediately found that there were several types of notes within that group Just as there had been in the total group. Becoming immediately suspicious, I sorted through each of the other two main groups and found similar situations in each. In each group there was finally to emerge a definite set of <b>statements</b> (product <b>statements</b>) that represented that group's purpose--e.g., the specifications currently accepted for the design of the memo--and some of the <b>card</b>s contained candidate material for this. But there were also considerations about what these final <b>statements</b> might include or exclude or take into account, or conditions under which inclusion or modification might be relevant, or <b>statements</b> that were too bulky or brief or imprecise to be used as final <b>statements</b>.<br><br>It became apparent that the final issuance from my work, the memo itself, would represent but one facet of a complex symbol structure that would grow as the work progressed--a structure comprising three main <b>substructure</b>s, each of which had definite substructuring of its own that was apparent. I realized that I was being rather philosophi cally introspective with all of this analysis, but I was curious as to the potential value of future augmentation means in allowing me to deal explicitly with these types of structuring. So I went ahead, keeping the groups and sub-groups of <b>card</b>s separated, and trying to organize and develop them.<br><br>I found rather quickly that the job of extracting, rearranging, editing, and copying new <b>statements</b> into the <b>card</b>s which were to represent the current set of product <b>statements</b> in each grouping was rather tedious. This brought me to appreciate the value of some sort of copying device with which I could transfer specified strings of words from one <b>card</b> to another, thus composing new <b>statements</b> from fragments of existing ones. This type of device should not be too hard to develop and produce for a price that a professional man could justify paying, and it would certainly facilitate some valuable symbol-structuring pro<br><br>I also found that there would have been great value in having available the associative-trail marking and following <b>process</b>es. Statements very often had implicit linkages to other <b>statements</b> in the same group, and it would have been very useful to keep track of these associations. For instance, when several consideration <b>statements</b> bore upon a given product statement, and when that product statement came to be modified through some other consideration, it was not always easy to remember why it had been establishe has it had. Being able to fish out the other considerations linked to that statement would have helped considerably.<br><br>Also, trial organizations of the <b>statements</b> in a group could be linked into trial associative <b>trails</b>, so that a number of such organizations could be constructed and considered without copying that many sets of specially ordered <b>statements</b>. Any of the previously considered organizations could be reconstructed at will.<br><br>In trying to do flexible structuring and restructuring within my experiment, I found that I just didn't have the means to keep track of all of the kernel <b>statements</b> (<b>card</b>s) and the various relation ships between them that were important--at least by means that were easy enough to leave time and thought capacity enough for me to keep in mind the essential nature of the memo-writing <b>process</b>. But it was a very provocative experience, considering the possibilities that I sensed for the flexible and powerful ways in which I could apply myself to so universal a design task if I but had the necessary means with which to manipulate symbol structures.<br><br>It would actually seem quite feasible to develop a unit record system around <b>card</b>s and mechanical sorting, with automatic trail establishment and trail-following facility, and with associated means for selective copying or data transfer, that would enable development of some very powerful methodology for everyday intellectual work. It is plain that even if the equipment (<b>artifacts</b>) appeared on the market tomorrow, a good deal of empirical research would be needed to develop a methodology that would capitalize upon the artifact <b>process</b> capabilities. New <b>concepts</b> need to be concelved and tested relative to the way the \"thought kernels\" could be knitted together into working structures, and relative to the conceptual presentations which become available and the symbol-manipulation <b>process</b>es which provide these presentations.<br><br>Such an approach would present useful and interesting re search problems, and could very likely produce practical and significant results (language, <b>artifacts</b>, methodology) for improving the effective ness of professional problem solvers. However, the technological trends of today foretell the obsolescence of such electromechanical information handling equipment. Very likely, by the time good augmentation systems could be developed, and the first groups of users began to prove them out so that they could gain more widespread acceptance, electronic data <b>process</b>ing equipment would have evolved much further and become much more prevalent throughout the critical-problem domains of our society where such ideas would first be adopted. The relative limitations of the mechanical equipment in providing <b>process</b>es which could be usefully inte grated into the system would soon lead to its replacement by electronic computer equipment.<br><br>The next set of descriptive examples will involve the use of electronic computers, and their greatly increased flexibility and <b>process</b>ing potential will be evident. Research based upon such electronic <b>artifacts</b> would be able to explore language and methodology innovations of a much wider range of sophistication than could research based upon limited and relatively inflexible electromechanical <b>artifacts</b>. In particular, the electronic-based experi<b>mental</b> program could simulate the types of <b>process</b>es available from electromechanical <b>artifacts</b>, if it seemed possible (from the vantage of experience with the wide range of augmentation <b>process</b>es) that relatively powerful augmentation systems could be based upon their capabilities--but the relative payoffs for providing even-more-sophisticated artifact capabilities could be assessed too so that considerations of how much to invest in capital equipment versus how much increase in human effectiveness to expect could be based upon some experi<b>mental</b> data.<br><br>4 A Quick Summary of Relevant Computer Technology<br><br>This section may be of value both to readers who are already familiar with computers, and to those who are not. A little familiarity with computer technology, enough to help considerably in understanding the augmentation possibilities discussed in thls report, can be gained by the uninitiated. For those already familiar with the technology, the following discussion can perhaps help them gain more understanding of our <b>concepts</b> of <b>process</b> and symbol structuring.<br><br>A computer is directly capable of performing any of a basic repertoire of very primitive symbol-manipulation <b>process</b>es (such as \"move the symbol in location A to location 12417,\" or \"compare the symbol in location A with that in location B, and if they are the same, set switch S to ON\"). There may be from ten to over a hundred different primitive <b>process</b>es which a particular machine can execute, and all of the computer's more sophisticated <b>process</b>es are structured from these primitive <b>process</b>es. It takes a repertoire of surprisingly few such primitive <b>process</b>es to enable the construction of any symbol-manipulation <b>process</b> that can be explicitly described in any language.<br><br>Somewhat the same situation exists relative to symbol structures i.e., there are only a very few primitive symbols with which the machine can actually work, and any new and different symbol has to be defined to the machine as a particular structure (or organization) of its primitive symbols. Actually, in every commercial digital computer, there are only two primitive symbols. Usually these are dealt with in standard-sized packets (called \"words\") of from eighteen to forty-eight primitive symbols, but arbitrary use can be made of individual primitives or of subgroups of the word.<br><br>To have the computer perform a non-trivial task or <b>process</b>, a structure of the primitive <b>process</b>es is organized (a computer program) and stored within the computer as a corresponding symbol structure. The computer successively examines the symbol <b>substructure</b> representing each primitive <b>process</b> in the program and executes that <b>process</b>--which usually alters the total internal symbol structure of the machine in some way. Lt makes no difference to the computer whether the symbols involved in the re-structuring represent part of the computer program or part of the lnformation upon which the program is operating. The ability to have the computer modify its own <b>process</b> structure (program) hss been a very im portant factor in the development of its power.<br><br>Thus, some very sophisticated techniques for <b>process</b> and symbol structuring have evolved in the computer field, as evidenced by the very sophisticated <b>process</b>es (e.g., predicting election returns, calculating orbits, translating natural languages) that can be structured to manipulate very complex structures of symbols. Among the more interesting computer-<b>process</b> structures that have evolved are those that can automatically develop a structure of primitive computer <b>process</b>es to accomplish symbol manipulation tasks that are specified on a relatively high level of abstraction. Special languages have been evolved in several fields (e.g., ALGOL and FORTRAN for scientific calculations, COBOL for business <b>process</b>ing) that enable explicit prescription of complex manipulation <b>process</b>es in a rapid and concise manner by a human, thinking about the <b>process</b>es in a rather natural manner, so that special computer programs or <b>process</b> structures (called Translators, Compilers, or sometimes in a slightly different sense, Interpreters) can construct the necessary structures of primitive <b>process</b>es and symbols that would enable the computer to execute the prescribed <b>process</b>es. This development has extended immensely our capability for making use of computers--otherwise the specification of a complex <b>process</b> would often occupy a formidable number of man hours, and be subject to a great many errors which would be very costly to find and correct.<br><br>Computers have been used to simulate dynamic systems for which we humans had none but descriptive models, from which we otherwise could gain little feel for the way the system behaves. A very notable instance of this, for our consideration, has been in the area of the human thought <b>process</b>es. Newell, Shaw, and Simon initiated this approach) from which there has derived a number of features of interest to us. For one, they discovered that the symbol structures and the <b>process</b> structures required for such simulation became exceedingly complex, and the burden of organizing these was a terrific impediment to their simulation research. They devised a structurlng technique for their symbols that is basically simple but from which stem results that are very elegant. Their baslc symbol structure is what they call a 'list,\" a string of <b>substructure</b>s that are linked <b>serial</b>ly in exactly the manner proposed by Bush for the associative <b>trails</b> in his Memex--i.e., each <b>substructure</b> contains the necessary information for locating the next <b>substructure</b> on the list. Here, though, each <b>substructure</b> could also be a list of <b>substructure</b>s, and each of these could also, etc. Their standard manner for organizing the data which the computer was to operate upon is thus what they term \"list structuring.\"<br><br>They also developed special languages to descrlbe different basic <b>process</b>es involved in list-structure manipulation. The most widely used of their languages, IPL-V (the fifth version of their Information Processing Languages), is described in a recent book edited by Newell.(7) In these languages, both the data to be worked upon and the symbols which designate the <b>process</b>es to be executed upon that data are developed in list-structure form.<br><br>Other languages and techniques for the manipulation of list structures have been described by McCarthy,(8) by Gelernter, Hansen, and Gerberich, (9) by Yngve, (10,11) by Perlis and Thornton, (12) by Carr, (13) and by Weizenbaum.(14) The application of these techniques has been mainly of two types--one of modelling complex <b>process</b>es and systems (e.g., the human thought <b>process</b>es), where the emphasis is upon the model and its behavior, and the other of trying to get computer behavior that is intelligent whether or not the <b>process</b>es and behavior resemble those of a human. The languages and techniques used in both types of application promise to be of considerable value to the development of radical new augmentation systems for human problem solvers, and we shall deal later with them in more detail.<br><br>Computers have various means for storing symbols so that they are accessible to it for manipulation. Assuming that the human might want to have a repertoire of sixty-four basic symbols (letters, numbers, special symbols), we can discuss various forms of storage in terms of their capacity for storing these kinds of symbols (each oi which would be structured, in the computer and storage devices, as a group of six primitive computer symbols). Fast access to an arbitrary choice of a few neighboring symbols (of the human's repertoire) can be had to perhaps 100,000 such symbols within the period in which the computer can execute one of its primitive <b>process</b>es (from two to ten millionths of a second, depending upon the computer involved). This is the so-called high-speed, random-access working store, where space for the human's symbols might cost between sixty cents and $1.50 per symbol.<br><br>Cheaper, larger-capacity backup storage is usually provided by devices to which access takes considerably longer (in the computer's time reference). A continuously rotating magnetic drum can hold perhaps a million of these symbols, for which access to a random storage position may average a thirtieth of a second (waiting for the drum to come around to bring that storage position under the magnetic reading head). This is short in the human's time scale, but a reasonably fast computer could execute about 3,000 of its primitive <b>process</b>es during that time. Generally, information transfer between a drum and fast-access working storage takes place in blocks of data which are stored in successive positions around the drum. Such block-transfer is accomplished by a relatively small structure of primitive computer <b>process</b>es that cyclically executes the transfer of one word at a time until the designated block has been trans ferred. Drum storage costs about 5\u00a2 per each of the basic symbols used by the human in our example.<br><br>Another type of backup storage uses a number of large, thin discs (about three feet in diameter), with magnetic coating on the sur faces. The discs are stacked with enough space between each so that a moveable read-record head can be positioned radially to line up over a specific circular track of symbol storage space. A commercially available disc storage system could hold over a hundred million of the human's basic symbols, to which random access would average about a tenth of a second, and where the cost per symbol-space would be about one seventh of a cent.<br><br>Magnetic tapes are commonly used for backup storage, too. For these, the random access time for storage blocks are of the order of a minute or two. Here, however, the actual storage units (the tape reels) can be taken off and shelf stored, so the total storage capacity may be very large--however, the time to locate a reel and exchange reels on the tape transport adds to the above-quoted access time--and this locating and reel changing are not generally automatic <b>process</b>es (i.e., a human has to do them). A transport unit, connected to the computer, might cost $30,000, with tape reels at $50 each holding about five million of the human's basic symbols. For one reel, storage space for each such symbol cost about two-thirds of a cent, but for twenty full reels in a \"library\" the cost comes down to about one-thirtieth of a cent per symbol space.<br><br>Other types of buffer storage for computer symbol structures are becoming available, and there is considerable economic demand spurring continuing research toward storage means that give high capacity at low cost, and with as short an access time as possible. Within the next ten years there would seem to be a very high probability of significant ad vances to this end.<br><br>For presenting computer-stored information to the human, techniques have been developed by which a cathode-ray-tube (of which the television picture tube is a familiar example) can be made to present symbols on their screens of quite good brightness, clarity, and with considerable freedom as to the form of the symbol. Under computer control an arbitrary collection of symbols may be arranged on the screen, with considerable freedom as to relative location, size, and brightness. Similarly, line drawings, curves, and graphs may be presented, with any of the other symbols intermixed. It is possible to describe to the computer, and thereafter use, new symbols of arbitrary shape and size. On displays of this sort, a light pen (a pen-shaped tool with a flexible wire to the electronic console) can be pointed by the human at any symbol or line on the display, and the computer can automatically determine what the pen is pointing at.<br><br>A cathode-ray-tube display of this sort is currently limited in resolution to about 800 lines across the face of the tube (in either direction). The detail with which a symbol may be formed, and the preciseness with which the recurrent images of it may be located, are both affected by this figure so that no matter how large the screen of such a tube, the maximum number of symbols that can be put on with usable clearness remains the same.<br><br>The amount of usable information on such a screen, in the form of letters, numbers, and diagrams, would be limited to about what a normal human eye could make out at the normal reading distance of fourteen inches on a surface 3-1/2 inches square, or to what one could discern on an ordinary 8-1/2-by-11-inch sheet of paper at about three feet. This means that one couldnot have a single-tube display giving him an 8-1/2-by-11-inch frame to view that would have as much on it as he might be used to seeing, say on the page of a journal article.<br><br>The costs of such displays are now quite high--ranging from $20,000 to $60,000, depending upon the symbol repertoire, symbol-structure display capacity, and the quality of the symbol forms. One should expect these prices to be lowered quite drastically as our technology improves and the market for these displays increases.<br><br>Much cheaper devices can \"draw\" arbitrary symbol shapes and diagrams on paper, at a speed for symbols that is perhaps a quarter of the rate that a typewriter can produce them. Also, special typewriters (at $3,000 to $4,000 apiece) can type out information on a sheet of paper, as well as allow the human to send information to the computer via the keyboard. But these two types of devices do not allow fast and flexible rearrangement of the symbols being displayed, which proves to be an important drawback in our current view of future possibilities for augmentation.<br><br>For communicating to the computer, considerable freedom exists in arranging pushbuttons, switches, and keysets for use by the human. The \"interpretation\" or response to be made by the computer to the actuation of any button, switch, or key (or to any combination thereof) can be established in any manner that is describable as a structure of primitive computer <b>process</b>es--which means essentially any manner that is explicitly describable. The limitation on the flexibility and power of any expllcit \"shorthand\" system with which the human may wish to utilize these input devices is the human's ability to learn and to use them.<br><br>There are also computer-input devices that can sense enough data from handwriting to allow a computer to recognize a limited number of handwritten symbols--both as they are being written and afterwards. Means for recognizing typescript are rather well developed and are already being designed into some large documentation and language translation systems. Also, a little progress has been made toward developing equipment that can recognize a limited spoken vocabulary. There is considerable economic pressure toward developing useful and cheap devices of this type, and we can expect relatively sophisticated capabilities to become available within the next ten years. Such equipment may play an important role in the individual-augmentation systems of the future (but our feeling is that a very powerful augmentation system can be developed without them).<br><br>An important type of development for our consideration of providing individual humans with close-coupled computer services is what is known as time sharing. Suppose a number of individual users connect to the same computer The computer can be programmed to serve them under any of a wide variety of rules. One such could be similar to the way the telephone system gives you attention and service when you ask for it--i.e., if too many other demands are not being made for service at that time, you get instant attention; otherwise, you wait until some service capacity is free to attend to you.<br><br>Our view of the interaction of human and computer in the future augmented system sees a large number of relatlvely simple <b>process</b>es (human scale of large and simple) being performed by the computer for the human--<b>process</b>es which often will require only a few thousandths of a second of actual computer manipulation. Such a fast and agile helper as a computer can run around between a number of masters and seldom keep any of them waiting (at least, not long enough that they would notice it or be inconvenienced appreciably). Occasionally, of course, much larger periods of computer time will be needed by an individual, and then the other users might get their periodic milliseconds of service slipped in during these longer <b>process</b>es.<br><br>5. Other Related Thought and Work<br><br>When we began our search, we found a great deal of literature which put forth thought and work of general significance to our objective-- frankly, too much. Without having a conceptual framework, we could not efficiently filter out the significant kernels of fact and concept from the huge mass which we initially collected as a \"natural first step\" in our search. We feel rather unscholarly not to buttress our conceptual framework with plentiful reference to supporting work, but in truth it was too difficult to do. Developing the conceptual structure represented a sweeping synthesis job full of personal constructs from smatterings picked up in many places. Under these conditions, giving reference to a backup source would usually entail qualifying footnotes reflecting an unusual interpretation or exonerating the other author from the implications we derived from his work. We look forward to a stronger, more comprehensive, and more scholarly presentation evolving out of future work.<br><br>However, we do want to acknowledge thoughts and work we have come across that bear most directly upon the possibilities of using a computer in real-time working association with a human to improve his working effectiveness. These fall into two categories. The first category, which would include this report, presents speculations and possibilities but does not include reporting of significant experi<b>mental</b> results. Of these, Bush (6) is the earliest and one of the most directly stimulating. Licklider (15) provided the most general clear case for the modern computer, and coined the expression, \"man-computer symbiosis\" to refer to the close interaction relationship between the man and computer in mutually beneficial cooperation. Ulam (16) has specifically recommended close man-computer interaction in a chapter entitled, \"synergesis,\" where he points out in considerable detail the types of mathematical work which could be aided. Good (17) includes some conjecture about possibilities of intellectual aid to the human by close cooperation with a computer in a rather general way, and also presents a few interesting thoughts about a network model for structuring the conceptual kernels of information to facilitate a sort of self-organizing retrieval system. Ramo has given a number of talks dealing with the future possibilities of computers for \"extending man's intellect,\" and wrote several articles (18,19) His projections seem slanted more toward larger bodies of humans interacting with computers, in less of an intimate personal sense than the above papers or than our initial goal. Fein (20) in making a comprehensive projection of the growth and dynamic inter-relatedness of \"computer-related sciences,\" includes specific mention of the enhancement of human intellect by cooperative activity of men, mechanisms, and automata. He coined the term \"synnoetics\" as applicable generally to the cooperative interaction of people, mechanisms, plant or animal organisms, and automata into a system whose <b>mental</b> power is greater than that of its components, and presented a good picture of the integrated way in which many currently separate disciplines should be developed and taught in the future to do justice to their mutual roles in the important metadiscipline defined as \"synnoetics.\"<br><br>In the second category, there have been a few papers published recently describing actual work that bears directly upon our topic. Licklider and Clark, (21) and Culler and Huff, (22) in the 1962 Spring Joint Computer Conference, gave what are essentially progress reports of work going on now in exactly this sort of thing--a human with a computer backed display getting minute-by-minute help in solving problems. Teager (23,24) reports on the plans and current development of a large time-sharing system at MIT, which is planned to provide direct computer access for a number of outlying stations located in scientists' offices, giving each of these users a chance for real-time utilization of the computer.<br><br>There are several efforts that we have heard about, but for which there are either no publications or for which none have been discovered by us. Mr. Douglas Ross, of the Electronic Systems Laboratory at MIT has, we learned by direct conversation, been thinking and working on real-time man-machine interaction problems for some years. We have recently learned that a graduate student at MIT, Glenn Randa, (25) has developed the design of a remote display console under Ross for his graduate thesis project. We understand that another graduate student there, Ivan Sutherland, is currently using the display-computer facility on the TX-2 computer at Lincoln Lab to develop cooperative techniques for engineering-design problems. And at RAND, we have learned by personal discussion that Cliff Shaw, Tom Ellis, and Keith Uncapher have been involved in implementing a multi-station time-sharing system built around their JOHNNIAC computer. Termed the JOHNNIAC Open-Shop System (JOSS for short), it apparently is near completion, and will use remote type writer stations.<br><br>Undoubtedly, there are efforts of others falling into either or both categories that have been overlooked. Such oversight has not been intentional, and it is hoped that these researchers will make their pertinent work known to us.<br><br>B. HYPOTHETICAL DESCRIPTION OF COMPUTER-BASED AUGMENTATION SYSTEM<br><br>Let us consider some specific possibilities for redesigning the augmentation means for an intellectually oriented, problem-solving human. We choose to present those developments of language and methodology that can capitalize upon the symbol-manipulating and portraying capabilities of computer-based equipment. The picture of the possibilities to pursue will change and grow rapidly as research gets under way, but we need to provide what pictures we can--to give substance to the generalities developed in Section II, to try to impart our feeling of rich promise, and to introduce a possible research program (Section IV).<br><br></div><div id='full_0'><mark>Although our generalizations (about augmentation means, capability <b>hierarchies</b>, and <b>mental</b>-, concept-, symbol-, <b>process</b>-, and physical structuring) might retain their validity in the future--for instance, our generalized prediction that new developments in concept, symbol, and <b>process</b> structuring will prove to be tremendously important--the specific <b>concepts</b>, symbol structures, and <b>process</b>es that evolve will most likely differ from what we know and use now.</mark></div><div> In fact, even if we in some way could know now what would emerge after say, ten years of research, it is likely that any but a general description would be difficult to express in today's terminology.<br><br>1. Background<br><br>To try to give you (the reader) a specific sort of feel for our thesis in spite of this situation, we shall present the following picture of computer-based augmentation possibilities by describing what might happen if you were being given a personal discussion-demonstration by a friendly fellow (named Joe) who is a trained and experienced user of such an augmentation system within an experi<b>mental</b> research program which is several years beyond our present stage. We assume that you approach this demonstration-interview with a background similar to what the previous portion of this report provides--that is, you will have heard or read a set of generalizations and a few rather primitive examples, but you will not yet have been given much of a feel for how a computer-based augmentation system can really help a person.<br><br>Joe understands this and explains that he will do his best to give you the valid conceptual feel that you want--trying to tread the narrow line between being too detailed and losing your over-all view anc being too general and not providing you with a solid feel for what goes on. He suggests that you sit and watch him for a while as he pursues some typical work, after which he will do some explaining. You are not particularly flattered by this, since you know that he is just going to be exercising new language and methodology developments on his new <b>artifacts</b>--and after all, the <b>artifacts</b> don't look a bit different from what you expected--so why should he keep you sitting there as if you were a complete stranger to this stuff? It will just be a matter of \"having the computer do some of his symbol-manipulating <b>process</b>es for him so that he can use more powerful <b>concepts</b> and concept-manipulation techniques,\" as you have so often been told.<br><br>Joe has two display screens side by side, but one of them he doesn't seem to use as much as the other. And the screens are almost horizontal, more like the surface of a drafting table than the near-vertical picture displays you had somehow imagined. But you see the reason easily, for he is working on the display surface as intently as a draftsman works on his drawings, and it would be awkward to reach out to a vertical surface for this kind of work. Some of the time Joe is using both hands on the keys, obviously feeding information into the computer at a great rate.<br><br>Another slight surprise, though--you see that each hand operates on a set of keys on its own side of the display frames, so that the hands are almost two feet apart. But it is plain that this arrangement allows him to remain positioned over the frames in a rather natural position, so that when he picks the light pen out of the air (which is its rest position, thanks to a system of jointed supporting arms and a controlled tension and rewind system for the attached cord) his hand is still on the way from the keyset to the display frame. When he is through with the pen at the display frame, he lets go of it, the cord rewinds, and the pen is again in position. There is thus a minimum of effort, movement, and time involved in turning to work on the frame. That is, he could easily shift back and forth from using keyset to using light pen, with either hand (one pen is positioned for each hand), without moving his head, turning, or leaning.<br><br>A good deal of Joe's time, though, seems to be spent with one hand on a keyset and the other using a light pen on the display surface. It is in this type of working mode that the images on the display frames changed most dynamically. You receive another real surprise as you realize how much activity there is on the face of these display tubes. You ask yourself why you weren't prepared for this, and you are forced to admit that the generalizations you had heard hadn't really sunk in--\"new methods for manipulating symbols\" had been an oft-repeated term, but it just hadn't included for you the images of the free and rapid way in which Joe could make changes in the display, and of meaningful and flexible \"shaping\" of ideas and work status which could take place so rapidly.<br><br>Then you realized that you couldn't make any sense at all out of the specific things he was doing, nor of the major part of what you saw on the displays. You could recognize many words, but there were a good number that were obviously special abbreviations of some sort. During the times when a given image or portion of an image remained un changed long enough for you to study it a bit, you rarely saw anything that looked llke a sentence as you were used to seeing one. You were beginning to gather that there were other symbols mixed with the words that might be part of a sentence, and that the different parts of what made a full-thought statement (your feeling about what a sentence is) were not just laid out end to end as you expected. But Joe suddenly cleared the displays and turned to you with a grin that signalled the end of the passive observation period, and also that somehow told you that he knew very well that you now knew that you had needed such a period to shake out some of your limited images and to really realize that a \"capability hierarchy\" was a rich and vital thing.<br><br>\"I guess you noticed that I was using unfamiliar notions, symbols, and <b>process</b>es to go about doing things that were even more unfamiliar to you?\" You made a non-committal nod--you saw no reason to admit to him that you hadn't even been able to tell which of the things he had been doing were to cooperate with which other things--and he continued. \"To give you a feel for what goes on, I'm going to start discussing and demonstrating some of the very basic operations and notions I've been using. You've read the stuff about <b>process</b> and <b>process</b>-capability <b>hierarchies</b>, I'm sure. I know from past experience in explaining radical augmentation systems to people that the new and powerful higher-level capabilities that they are interested in--because basically those are what we are all anxious to improve--can't really be explained to them without first giving them some understanding of the new and powerful capabilities upon which they are built. This holds true right on down the line to the type of low-level capability that is new and different to them all right, but that they just wouldn't ordinarily see as being 'powerful.' And yet our systems wouldn't be anywhere near as powerful without them, and a person's comprehension of the system would be rather shallow if he didn't have some understanding of these basic capabilities and of the hierarchical structure built up from them to provide the highest-level capabilities.\"<br><br>2. Single-Frame Composition<br><br>\"For explanation purposes here, let's say that the lowest level at which the computer system comes into direct play in my capability hierarchy is in the task of what I'll call 'single-frame composition.' We'll stick to working with prose text in our examples--most people can grasp easily enough what we are doing there without having to have special backgrounds in mathematics or science as they would to gain equal comprehension for some of the similar sorts of things we do with diagrams and mathematical equations. This low-level composition task is just what you normally do with a pen or pencil or typewriter on a piece of paper-- that is, assemble a bunch of symbols before your eyes in order to portray something which you have in mind.\"<br><br>You listened and watched as Joe showed you some of the different ways in which the composition of straightforward text was made easier for him in this system. With either hand, Joe could \"type\" (the keysets didn't look at all like typewriter keyboards) individual letters and numbers, and if he had directed it to do so, the computer would put each successive symbol next to its predecessor just as a typewriter does--only here there was completely automatic \"carriage return\" service. This didn't impress you very much, since an automatic carriage-return feature was sort of a trivial return on the investment behind all of this equipment--but then you reflected that, as long as the computer was there anyway, to help do all the flashy things you had witnessed earlier, one might as well use it in all of the little helpful ways he could.<br><br>But there were other ways in which help was derived for this composition task. He showed you how he could call up the dictionary definition to any word he had typed in, with but a few quick flicks on the keyset. Synonyms or antonyms could just as easily be brought forth. This also seemed sort of trivially obvious, and Joe seemed to know that you would feel so. \"It turns out that this simple capability makes it feasible to do some pretty rough tasks in the upper levels of the capability hierarchy--where precise use of special terms really pays off, where the human just couldn't be that precise by depending upon his unaided memory for definitions and 'standards,' and where using dictionary and reference-book lookup in the normal fashion would be so distracting and time-consuming that the task execution would break down. We've tried taking this feature away in some of these <b>process</b>es up there, and believe me, the result was a mess.<br><br>You could get some dim feeling for what he meant, having watched him working for a while, but you were nevertheless much relieved to find the next thing he showed you to be more directly impressive. He showed you how he could single out a group of words (called the \"object symbol string,\" or simply \"object string\") and define an abbreviation term, composed of any string of symbols he might choose, that became associated with the object string in computer storage. At any later time (until he chose to dis<b>card</b> that particular abbreviation from his working voca bulary) the typing of the abbreviation term would call forth automatically the \"printing\" on the display of the entire object string. Joe showed you another way in which this abbreviation feature might work. He \"arranged\" for the computer to print the abbreviation on the display, just the way he typed it in. At a subsequent reading, if he had for gotten what the abbreviation stood for, he could call for substitution of the full object string to refresh his memory.<br><br>Then he showed you how this sort of facility had been extended, in a refined way, to provide a rather powerful sort of shorthand. He could hit a great many combinations of keys on his keyset--i.e., any one stroke of his hand could depress a number of keys, which gave him over a thousand unique single-stroke signals to the computer with either hand. Some of these signals were used as abbreviations for entire words. It seems that, for instance, the 150 most commonly used words in a natural language made up about half of any normal text in that language. Joe said that it was thus quite feasible to learn and use the single-stroke abbreviations for about half of the words he used, but beyond that each added percent began to require him to have too many abbreviations under his command. But he said that there were a lot of word endings, letter pairs (diagrams), and letter triplets (trigrams) that were so common as to make it pay to abbreviate them to a single stroke. A whole word so abbreviated saved typing all the letters as well as the spaces at either side of the word, and a word-ending abbreviated by a single stroke saved typing the letters and the end-of-word space. He claimed that he could comfortably rattle off about 180 words a minute--faster than he could comfortably talk. You believed him after he transcribed your talking for a minute or so, and it gave you an eerie feeling to see the near instantaneous appearance of your words and sentences in neat printed form.<br><br>Joe said that there were other miscellaneous simple features, and some quite sophisticated features to help the composition <b>process</b>. He made some brief references to statistical predictions that the com puter could make regarding what you were golng to type next, and that if you got reasonably skillful you could \"steer through the extrapolated prediction field\" as you entered your information and often save energy and time. You gathered that he thought you would saturate about there on this particular subject, because he went on to the next.<br><br>3. Single-Frame Manipulation<br><br>\"Even if I couldn't actually specify new symbols here any faster than with a typewriter, the extreme flexibility that this computer system provides for making changes in what is presented on the display screen would make me very much more effective in creating finished text than I could ever be on a typewriter.\" With this statement, Joe proceeded to show you what he meant. The frame full of your transcribed speech was still showing, and it represented the clumsy phrasing and illogical progression of thought so typical of extemporaneous speech. Joe took the light gun in his right hand, and with a deft flick of it, coordinated with a stroke of his left hand on its keyset, caused the silent and instantaneous deletion of a superfluous word. The word disappeared from the frame, and the rest of the text simultaneously readjusted to present the neat, no-gap, full-line appearance it had had.<br><br>With but slightly more motion of his light pen, he could similarly delete any string of words or letters. He demonstrated this by cutting out what I thought to be some relevant prose, and then he showed how the system allowed for second thoughts about such human-directed <b>process</b>es--those words were automatically saved for a brief period in case he wanted to call them back. Leaving his light pen pointed at the space where a deleted symbol string used to be, Joe could reinstate it instantaneously with one stroke of his left hand.<br><br>Adding one more light-pen pointing to what it took to delete an arbitrary string of symbols, Joe could direct the computer to move that string from where it was to insert it at a new point which his light pen designated. Again it would disappear instantaneously from where it had been, but now the modified display would show the old text to have been spread apart just enough at the indicated point to hold this string. The text would all still look as neat as if freshly retyped. With similar types of keyset and light-pen operations, Joe could change paragraph break points, transpose two arbitrary symbol strings (words, sentences, paragraphs, etc., or fragments thereof), readjust margins of arbitrary sections of text--essentially being able to affect immediately any of the changes that a proofreader might want to designate with his special marks, only here the proofreader is always looking at clean text as if it had been instantaneously retyped after each designation had been made.<br><br>Joe also demonstrated how he could request that each instance of the use of a given term be changed to a newly designated term, and this would again be instantaneously accomplished. Also, he could arbitrarily set the margins between which any section of text must appear, and its line lengths and number of lines would automatically be adjusted. He showed how this was useful in displaying parallel or counter arguments-- although he said that actual use of this feature was a bit more sophisticated--by squeezing each into half width and putting them side by side (with a vertical line suddenly separating them). One of the sections of text was about a third longer than the other--but two quick strokes with Joe's left hand caused the computer to adjust the display automatically. The middle separator line was moved toward the shorter piece of text, and the line lengths of the two sections were adjusted so that they occupied the same length along the dlsplay frame. Yes, you were beginning to get a feel for what the expression \"flexible new methods for manipulating symbol structures\" might really imply, at least on this basic-capability level.<br><br>4. Structuring an Argument<br><br>\"If we want to go on to a higher-level capability to give you a feeling for how our rebuilt capability hierarchy works, it will speed us along to look at how we might organize these more primitive capabilities which I have demonstrated into some new and better ways to set up what we can call an 'argument.' This refers loosely to any set of <b>statements</b> (we'll call them 'product <b>statements</b>') that represents the product of a period of work toward a given objective. Confused? Well, take the simple case where an argument leads to a single product statement. For instance, you come to a particular point in your work where you have to decide what to do for the next step. You go through some reasoning <b>process</b>--usually involving <b>statements</b>--and come up with a statement specifying that next step. That final statement is the product statement, and it represents the product of the argument or reasoning <b>process</b> which led to it.<br><br>\"You usually think of an argument as a <b>serial</b> sequence of steps of reason, beginning with known facts, assumptions, etc., and progressing toward a conclusion. Well, we do have to think through these steps <b>serial</b>ly, and we usually do list the steps <b>serial</b>ly when we write them out because that is pretty much the way our papers and books have to present them--they are pretty limiting in the symbol structuring they enable us to use. Have you even seen a 'scrambled-text' programmed instruction book? That is an interesting example of a deviation from straight <b>serial</b> presentation of steps.<br><br>\"Conceptually speaking, however, an argument is not a <b>serial</b> affair. It is sequential, I grant you, because some <b>statements</b> have to follow others, but this doesn't imply that its nature is necessarily <b>serial</b>. We usually string Statement B after Statement A, with Statements C, D, E, F, and so on following in that order--this is a <b>serial</b> structuring of our symbols. Perhaps each statement logically followed from all those which preceded it on the <b>serial</b> list, and if so, then the conceptual structuring would also be <b>serial</b> in nature, and it would be nicely matched for us by the symbol structuring.<br><br>\"But a more typical case might find A to be an independent statement, B dependent upon A, C and D independent, E depending upon D and B, E dependent upon C, and F dependent upon A, D, and E. See, sequential but not <b>serial</b>? A conceptual network but not a conceptual chain. The old paper and pencil methods of manipulating symbols just weren't very adaptable to making and using symbol structures to match the ways we make and use conceptual structures. With the new symbol-manipulating methods here, we have terrific flexibility for matching the two, and boy, it really pays off in the way you can tie into your work.<br><br></div><div id='full_2'><mark>This makes you recall dimly the generalizations you had heard previously about <b>process</b> structuring limiting symbol structuring, symbol structuring limiting concept structuring, and concept structuring limiting <b>mental</b> structuring.</mark></div><div> You nod cautiously, in hopes that he will proceed in some way that will tie this kind of talk to something from which you can get the \"feel\" of what it is all about. As it turns out, that is just what he intends to do.<br><br>\"Let's actually work some examples. You help me.\" And you become involved in a truly fascinating game. Joe tells you that you are to develop an argument leading to <b>statements</b> summarizing the augmentation means so far revealed to you for doing the kind of straight-text work usually done with a pencil and eraser on a single sheet of paper. You unconsciously look for a scratch pad before you realize that he is telling you that you are going to do this the \"augmented way\" by using him and his system--with artful coaching from him. Under a bit of urging from him, you begin self-consciously to mumble some inane <b>statements</b> about what you have seen, what they imply, what your doubts and reservations are, etc. He mercilessly ignores your obvious discomfort and gives you no cue to stop, until he drops his hands to his lap after he has filled five frames with these <b>statements</b> (the surplus filled frames disappeared to somewhere--you assume Joe knows where they went and how to get them back).<br><br>\"You notice how you wandered down different short paths, and criss-crossed yourself a few times?\" You nod--depressed, no defense. But he isn't needling you. \"Very natural development, just the way we humans always seem to start out on a task for which we aren't all primed with knowledge, method, experience, and confidence--which is to include essentially every problem of any consequence to us. So let's see how we can accommodate the human's way of developing his comprehension and his final problem solution.<br><br>\"Perhaps I should have stopped sooner--I am supposed to be coaching you instead of teasing you--but I had a reason. You haven't been making use of the simple symbol-manipulation means that I showed you--other than the shorthand for getting the stuff on the screens. You started out pretty much the way you might with your typewriter or pencil. I'll show you how you could have been doing otherwise, but I want you to notice first how hard it is for a person to realize how really unques tioning he is about the way he does things. Somehow we implicitly view most all of our methods as just sort of 'the way things are done, that's all.' You knew that some exotic techniques were going to be applied, and you'll have to admit that you were passively waiting for them to be handed to you.\"<br><br>With a non-committal nod, you suggest getting on with it. Joe begins, \"You're probably waiting for something impressive. What I'm trying to prime you for, though, is the realization that the impressive new tricks all are based upon lots of changes in the little things you do. This computerized system is used over and over and over again to help me do little things--where my methods and ways of handling little things are changed until, lo, they've added up and suddenly I can do impressive new things.\"<br><br>You don't know. He's a nice enough guy, but he sure gets preachy. But the good side of your character shows through, and you realize that everything so far has been about little things--this is probably an important point. You'll stick with him. Okay, so what could you have been doing to use the simple tricks he had shown you in a useful way? Joe picks up the light pen, poises his other hand over the keyset, and looks at you. You didn't need the hint, but thanks anyway, and let's start rearranging and cleaning up the work space instead of just dumping more raw material on it.<br><br>With closer coaching now from Joe, you start through the list of <b>statements</b> you've made and begin to edit, re-word, compile, and delete. It's fun--\"put that sentence back up here between these two\"--and blink, it's done. \"Group these four <b>statements</b>, indented two spaces, under the heading \"shorthand,\" and blink, it's done. \"Insert what I say next there, after that sentence.\" You dictate a sentence to extend a thought that is developing, and Joe effortlessly converts it into an inserted new sentence. Your ideas begin to take shape, and you can continually re-work the existing set of <b>statements</b> to keep representing the state of your \"concept structure.\"<br><br>You are quite elated by this freedom to juggle the record of your thoughts, and by the way this freedom allows you to work them into shape. You reflected that this flexible cut-and-try <b>process</b> really did appear to match the way you seemed to develop your thoughts. Golly, you could be writing math expressions, ad copy, or a poem, with the same type of benefit. You were ready to tell Joe that now you saw what he had been trying to tell you about matching symbol structuring to concept structuring--when he moved on to show you a succession of other tech niques that made you realize you hadn't yet gotten the full significance of his pitch.<br><br>So far the structure that you have built with your symbols looks just like what you might build with pencil-and-paper techniques-- only here the building is so much easier when you can trim, extend, insert, and rearrange so freely and rapidly. But the same computer here that gives us these freedoms with so trivial an application of its power, can just as easily give us other simple capabilities which we can apply to the development and use of different types of structure from what we used to use. But let me unfold these little computer tricks as we come to them.<br><br>\"When you look at a given statement in the middle of your argument structure, there are a number of things you want to know. Let's simplify the sltuation by saying that you might ask three questions, 'What's this?', 'How come?', and 'So what?' Let's take these questions one at a time and see how some changes in structuring might help a per son answer them better.<br><br>You look at a statement and you want to understand its meaning. You are used to seeing a statement portrayed in just the manner you might hear it--as a <b>serial</b> succession of words. But, just as with the <b>statements</b> within an argument, the conceptual relationship among the words of a sentence is not generally <b>serial</b>, and we can benefit in matching better to the conceptual structure if we can conveniently work with cer tain non-<b>serial</b> symbol-structuring forms within sentences.<br><br>\"Most of the structuring forms I'll show you stem from the simple capability of being able to establish arbitrary linkages between different <b>substructure</b>s, and of directing the computer subsequently to display a set of linked <b>substructure</b>s with any relative positioning we might designate among the different <b>substructure</b>s. You can designate as many different kinds of links as you wish, so that you can specify different display or manipulative treatment for the different types.\"<br><br>Joe picked out one of your sentences, and pushed the rest of the text a few lines up and down from it to isolate it. He then showed you how he could make a few strokes on the keyset to designate the type of link he wanted established, and pick the two symbol structures that were to be linked by means of the light pen. He said that most links possessed a direction, i.e., they were like an arrow pointing from one <b>substructure</b> to another, so that in setting up a link he must specify the two <b>substructure</b>s in a given order.<br><br>He went to work for a moment, rapidly setting up links within your sentence. Then he showed you how you could get some help in looking at a statement and understanding it. \"Here is one standard portrayal, for which I have established a computer <b>process</b> to do the structuring automatically on the basis of the interword links.\" A few strokes on the keyset and suddenly the sentence fell to pieces--different parts of it being positioned here and there, with some lines connecting them. \"Remember diagramming sentences when you were studying grammar? Some good methods, plus a bit of practice, and you'd be surprised how much a diagrammatic breakdown can help you to scan a complex statement and untangle it quickly.<br><br>\"We have developed quite a few more little schemes to help at the statement level. I don't want to tangle you up with too much detail, though. You can see, probably, that quick dictionary-lookup helps.\" He aimed at a term with the light pen and hit a few strokes on the keyset, and the old text jumped farther out of the way and the definition appeared above the diagram, with the defined term brighter than the rest of the diagram. And he showed you also how you could link secondary phrases (or sentences) to parts of the statement for more detailed description. These secondary <b>substructure</b>s wouldn't appear when you normally viewed the statement, but could be brought in by simple request if you wanted closer study.<br><br>\"It proves to be terrifically useful to be able to work easily with <b>statements</b> that represent more sophisticated and complex <b>concepts</b>. Sort of like being able to use <b>structural</b> members that are lighter and stronger--it gives you new freedom in building structures. But let's move on--we'll come back to this area later, if we have time.<br><br>\"When you look at a statement and ask, 'How come?', you are used to scanning back over a <b>serial</b> array of previously made <b>statements</b> in search of an understanding of the basis upon which this statement was made. But some of these previous <b>statements</b> are much more significant than others to this search for understanding. Let us use what we call 'antecedent links' to point to these, and I'll give you a basic idea of how we structure an argument so that we can quickly track down the essential basis upon which a given statement rests.\"<br><br>You helped him pick out the primary antecedents of the statement you had been studying, and he established links to them. These <b>statements</b> were scattered back through the <b>serial</b> list of <b>statements</b> that you had assembled, and Joe showed you how you could either brighten or underline them to make them stand out to your eye--just by requesting the computer to do this for all direct antecedents of the designated statement. He told you, though, that you soon get so you aren't very much interested in seeing the <b>serial</b> listing of all of the <b>statements</b>, and he made another request of the computer (via the keyset) that eliminated all the prior <b>statements</b>, except the direct antecedents, from the screen. The subject statement went to the bottom of the frame, and the antecedent <b>statements</b> were neatly listed above it.<br><br>Joe then had you designate an order of \"importance to comprehension\" among these <b>statements</b>, and he rearranged them accordingly as fast as you could choose them. (This choosing was remarkably helped by having only the remainder <b>statements</b> to study for each new choice--another little contribution to effectiveness, you thought.) He mentioned that you could designate orderings under several different criteria, and later have the display show whichever ordering you wished. This, he implied, could be used very effectively when you were building or studying an argument structure in which from time to time you wanted to strengthen your comprehension relative to different aspects of the situation.<br><br>\"Each primary antecedent can similarly be linked to its primary antecedents, and so on, until you arrive at the <b>statements</b> representing the premises, the accepted facts, and the objectives upon which this argument had been established. When we had established the antecedent links for all the <b>statements</b> in the argument, the question 'So what?' that you might ask when looking at a given statement would be answered by looking for the <b>statements</b> for which the given statement was an antecedent. We already have links to these consequents--just turn around the arrows on the antecedent links and we have consequent links. So we can easily call forth an uncluttered display of consequent <b>statements</b> to help us see why we needed this given statement in the argument.<br><br>\"To help us get better comprehension of the structure of an argument, we can also call forth a schematic or graphical display. Once the antecedent-consequent links have been established, the computer can automatically construct such a display for us.\" So, Joe spent a few minutes (with your help) establishing a reasonable set of links among the <b>statements</b> you had originally listed. Then another keyed-in request to the computer, and almost instantaneously there appeared a network of lines and dots that looked something like a tree--except that sometimes branches would fuse together. \"Each node or dot represents one of the <b>statements</b> of your argument, and the lines are antecedent-consequent links. The antecedents of one statement always lie above that statement-- or rather, their nodes lie above its node. When you get used to using a network representation like this, it really becomes a great help in getting the feel for the way all the different ideas and reasoning fit together-- that is, for the conceptual structuring.\"<br><br>Joe demonstrated some ways in which you could make use of the diagram to study the argument structure. Point to any node, give a couple of strokes on the keyset, and the corresponding statement would appear on the other screen--and that node would become brighter. Call the antecedents forth on the second screen, and select one of special interest--deleting the others. Follow back down the antecedent trail a little further, using one screen to look at the detail at any time, and the other to show you the larger view, with automatic node-brightening indication of where these detailed items fit in the larger view.<br><br>\"For a little embellishment here, and to show off another little capability in my repertoire, let me label the nodes so that you can develop more association between the nodes and the <b>statements</b> in the argument. I can do this several ways. For one thing, I can tell the computer to number the <b>statements</b> in the order in which you originally had them listed, and have the labelling done automatically.\" This took him a total of five strokes on the keyset, and suddenly each node was made into a circle with a number in it. The <b>statements</b> that were on the second screen now each had its respective <b>serial</b> number sitting next to it in the left margin. \"This helps you remember what the different nodes on the network display contain. We have also evolved some handy techniques for constructing abbreviation labels that help your memory quite a bit.<br><br>\"Also, we can display extra fine-structure and labelling detail within the network in the specific local area we happen to be concentrating upon. This finer detail is washed out as we move to another spot with our close attention, and the coarser remaining structure is compressed, so that there is room for our new spot to be blown up. It is a lot like using zones of variable magnification as you scan the structure--higher magnification where you are inspecting detail, lower magnification in the surrounding field so that your feel for the whole structure and where you are in it can stay with you.\"<br><br>5. General Symbol Structuring<br><br>\"If you are tangling with a problem of any size--whether it involves you for half an hour or two years--the entire collection of <b>statements</b>, sketches, computations, literature sources, and source extracts that is associated with your work would in our minds constitute a single symbol structure. There may be many levels of substructuring between the level of individual symbols and that represented by the entire collection. You and I have been worxing with some of the lower-ordered <b>substructure</b>s--the individual <b>statements</b> and the multistatement argu ments--and have skimmed through some of the ways to build and manipulate them. The results of small arguments are usually integrated in a higher level network of argument or concept development, and these into still higher-level networks, and so on. But at any such level, the manner in which the interrelationship between the kernels of argument can be tagged, portrayed, studied and manipulated is much the same as those which we have just been through.<br><br>\"Substructures that might represent mathematical or formal-logic arguments may be linked right in with <b>substructure</b>s composed of the more informal <b>statements</b>. Substructures that represent graphs, curves, engineering drawings, and other graphical forms can likewise be integrated. One can also append special <b>substructure</b>s, of any size, to particular other <b>substructure</b>s. A frequent use of this is to append descriptive material--something like footnotes, only much more flexible. Or, special messages can be hung on that offer ideas such as simplifying an argument or circumventing a blocked path--to be uncovered and considered at some later date. These different appended <b>substructure</b>s can remain invisible to the worker until such time as he wants to flush them into view. He can ask for the cue symbols that indicate their presence (identifying where they are linked and what their respective types are) to be shown on the network display any time he wishes, and then call up whichever of them he wishes If he is interested in only one type of appended <b>substructure</b>, he can request that only the cues associated with that type be displayed.<br><br>\"You should also realize that a <b>substructure</b> doesn't have to be a hunk of data sitting neatly distinct within the normal form of the larger structure. One can choose from a symbol structure (or <b>substructure</b>, generally) any arbitrary collection of its <b>substructure</b>s, designate any arbitrary structuring among these and any new <b>substructure</b>s he wants to add, and thus define a new <b>substructure</b> which the computer can untangle from the larger structure and present to him at any time. The associative <b>trails</b> that Bush suggested represent a primitive example of this. A good deal of this type of activity is involved during the early, shifting development of some phase of work, as you saw when you were collecting tentative argument chains. But here again, we find ever more delightful ways to make use of the straightforward-seeming capabilities in developing new higher-level capabilities--which, of course, seem sort of straight forward by then, too.<br><br>\"I found, when I learned to work with the structures and manipulation <b>process</b>es such as we have outlined, that I got rather impatient if I had to go back to dealing with the <b>serial</b>-statement structuring in books and journals, or other ordinary means of communicating with other workers. It is rather like having to project three-dimensional images onto two-dimensional frames and to work with them there instead of in their natural form. Actually, it is much closer to the truth to say that it is like trying to project n-dimensional forms (the concept structures, which we have seen can be related with many many nonintersecting links) onto a one-dimensional form (the <b>serial</b> string of symbols), where the human memory and visualization has to hold and picture the links and relationships. I guess that's a natural feeling, though. One gets impatlent any tlme he is forced into a restrlcted or primitive mode of operation--except perhaps for recreatlonal purposes.<br><br>\"I'm sure that you've had the experience of working over a journal article to get comprehension and perhaps some special-purpose conclusions that you can integrate into your own work. Well, when you ever get handy at roaming over the type of symbol structure which we have been showing here, and you turn for this purpose to another person's work that is structured in this way, you will find a terrific difference there in the ease of gaining comprehension as to what he has done and why he has done it, and of isolating what you want to use and making sure of the conditions under which you can use it. This is true even if you find his structure left in the condition in which he has been working on it--that is, with no special provisions for helping an outsider find his way around. But we have learned quite a few simple tricks for leaving appended road signs, supplementary information, questions, and auxiliary links on our working structures--in such a manner that they never get in our way as we work--so that the visitor to our structure can gain his comprehension and isolate what he wants in marvelously short order. Some of these techniques are quite closely related to those used in automated-instruction programming--perhaps you know about 'teaching machines?'<br><br>\"What we found ourselves doing, when having to do any extensive digesting of journal articles, was to type large batches of the text verbatim into computer store. It is so nice to be able to tear it apart, establish our own definitions and substitute, restructure, append notes, and so forth, in pursuit of comprehension, that it was generally well worth the trouble. The keyset shorthand made this reasonably practical. But the project now has an optical character reader that will convert our external references into machine code for us. The references are available for study in original <b>serial</b> form on our screens, but any structuring and tagging done by a previous reader, or ourselves, can also be utilized.<br><br>\"A number of us here are uslng the augmented systems for our project research, and we find that after a few passes through a reference, we very rarely go back to it in its original form. It sits in the archives like an orange rind, with most of the real juice squeezed out. The contributions from these references form sturdy members of our structure, and are duly tagged as to source so that acknowledgment is always implicitly noted. The analysis and digestion that any of us makes on such a reference is fully available to the others. It is rather amazing how much superfluous verbiage is contained in those papers merely to try to make up for the pitifully sparse possibilities available for symbol structuring in printed text.\"<br><br>6. Process Structuring<br><br>There was a slight pause while Joe apparently was reflecting upon something. He started to speak, thought differently of it, and turned to flash something on a screen. You looked quickly, anticipating that now you would comprehend. Well, more of the display looked meaningful to you than when you had first watched him going about his work, but you realized that you were still a bit uneducated. I've developed a sequence for presenting the different basic features of our augmentation system that seems to work pretty well, and I just wanted to be sure I was still following it reasonably closely.\"<br><br>He noticed you wrinkle your face as you looked at the display. \"It's time to shift the topic a bit, and some of the things on the screen that are probably puzzling you can make a starting point for a new discussion phase. See, when I outlined a delivery for giving a feel for these techniques to the uninitiated, I could have sketched out the subject matter in a skeletal argument structure. From what we've been through so far, you might expect it to be like that. What I did, though, was to treat the matter as a <b>process</b> that I was going to execute the <b>process</b> of giving you a lecture demonstration. It is a rather trivial exercise of the techniques we have for developing and manipulating <b>process</b>es, but anyway that's the form I chose for making the notes.<br><br>\"A <b>process</b> is something that is designed, built, and used--as is any tool. In the general sense in which we consider <b>process</b>es to be a part of our augmentation system, it is absolutely necessary that there be effective capability for designing and building <b>process</b>es as well as for using them. For one thing, the laying out of objectives and a method of approach for a problem represent a form of <b>process</b> design and building, to our way of looking at it. And an independent problem solver certainly has to have this capability. Indeed, we find that designing and coordinating one's sequence of steps, in high levels or in low levels of such <b>process</b> structuring, is an extremely important part of the total activity.<br><br>\"One of our research guys in the early phases of our augmentation development was considered (then) to be a bug on this topic. He maintained that about ten percent of the little steps we took all day accounted for ninety percent of the progress toward the goals we claimed to pursue--that is, that ninety percent of our actions and thoughts were coupled to our net progress in only a very feeble way. Well, we can't analyze the old ways of doing things very accurately to check his estimated figures, but we certainly have come to be in general sympathy with his stand. We have developed quite a few <b>concepts</b> and methods for using the computer system to help us plan and supervise sophisticated courses of action, to monitor and evaluate what we do, and to use this information as direct feedback for modifying our planning techniques in the future.<br><br>\"There are, of course, the explicit computer <b>process</b>es which we use, and which our philosophy requires the augmented man to be able to design and build for himself. A number of people, outside our research group here, maintain stoutly that a practical augmentation system should not require the human to have to do any computer programming--they feel that this is too specialized a capability to burden people with. Well, what that means in our eyes, if translated to a home workshop, would be like saying that you can't require the operating human to know how to adjust his tools, or set up jigs, or change drill sizes, and the like. You can see there that these skllls are easy to learn in the context of what the human has to learn anyway about using the tools, and that they provide for much greater flexibility in finding convenient ways to use the tools to help shape materials.<br><br>\"It won't take too much time to give you a feel for the helpf methods we have for working on computer-<b>process</b> structures -- or programs -- because there is quite a bit of similarity in concept to what you have seen in the symbol-structuring techniques. No matter what language you use -- whether machine language, list language, or ALGOL, for instance--you build up the required <b>process</b> structure by organizing <b>statements</b> in that language. Each statement specifies a given <b>process</b> to your computer. Well, you have already seen how you can get help in developing precise and powerful <b>statements</b>, or in gaining quick comprehension of state ments, by charting or diagramming them and using special links between the different parts. \"Look here.'\" And he went after what he said was a typical <b>process</b> structure, to give you an exa*ple of what he was talking about. In several brief, successive frame displays, before he got to the one he wanted, you got glimpses of network schematics that reminded you of those used in symbol structuring. But, what he finally had on the display frame was quite different from the argument <b>statements</b> you had seen.<br><br>\"In explaining symbol-structuring to you, I used the likely questions, 'What's this?' 'How come?' and 'So what?' to point out the usefulness of some of our structuring methods. Here, in <b>process</b> structuring, corresponding questions about a statement might be: 'What does it say to do?' 'What effect will that have?' and 'Why do we want that done?' Let's take a quick look at some of the ways you can get help in answering them.<br><br>\"The language used to compose these <b>process</b>-description stateme for the computer is considerably more compact and precise than is a natural language, such as English, and there is correspondingly less advantage to be gained by appending special links and tags for giving us humans a better grasp of their meaning. However, as you see in this left-hand section of the statement portrayal, geometrical grouping, linking, and positioning of the statement components are used in the blown-up statement display. But this portrayal doesn't stem from special appended information, it can be laid out like this automatically by the computer, just from the cues it gets from the necessary symbol components of the statement. The different significant relationships are more perceptible to a human in this way of laying it out, and an experienced human thus gets quite a bit of help in answering the first question: 'What does it say to do?'<br><br>For the second question, relative to what effect the specified action will have, some of these symbols to the right give you a quick story about the very detailed and immediate effect on the state of the symbol structure which this <b>process</b> structure is manipulating. Other symbols here provide keys which a light-pen selection can activate to bring to you displays of that symbol structure, usually a choice of several relevant views at different levels of the structure. Then I can use the keyset to ask for the preceding statement, if I'm a little puzzled about the detailed manipulation--or, I can request a specific higher-level view of the <b>process</b> structure by light-pen selection on one of these remaining symbols here.<br><br>So saying, Joe selected one of these symbols with his pen, and a new and different display popped into view. \"This is the next level up in the <b>process</b> structure. It consists of lists of compactly abbreviated <b>statements</b>, and some condensed notes about their effects. If we want, we can blow up one at a time as we study over the list. In this context, one can get some answer to the larger picture of what effect will a given statement have, and also some answer to the question about why we want a given effect produced. But this is a sort of a holdover from old pro gramming habits, and most of us nowadays are making considerably more use of the schematic techniques that evolved out of the program flow-charting techniques and out of our symbol-structuring techniques.<br><br>\"I know that you have less prevlous familiarity with the nature of programs than you do wlth the nature of arguments, so I'll just give you a few quick views of what these <b>process</b>-structure schematic portrayals look like, and not try to explain them in any detail. He flashed a few on the screen, and indicated how some of the different features could give the human a quick appreclation of how different component <b>process</b>es were cooperating to produce a more sophisticated <b>process</b>. You could appreciate some of the tricks of linking in explanatory and descriptive <b>substructure</b> and the general means of using all the different symbol-structuring tricks for representing to the human the considerations, critical features, and lnterdependencies involved in the <b>process</b> structure.<br><br>\"Most of this portrayal technique actually represents special structuring of what we previously defined in a loose way as arguments. The human who wants to approach an established <b>process</b> structure in order to modify it, needs to gain comprehension of the relevant features both of the functioning and of the design of the structure. You saw how this could be facilitated by our symbol-structuring techniques. And if he is building a new <b>process</b> structure or changing an existing one, he needs to structure the argument or reasoning behind the design. We have developed a number of special symbol-structuring techniques that allow us to match especially well to the <b>concepts</b> involved in designing <b>process</b>es.<br><br>\"But there is a very significant feature involved in this particular type of <b>process</b> structuring that I should tell you about. It is based upon the fact that the <b>process</b>-description language for the computer is formal and precise. Because of this fact, we can establish explicit rules for treating <b>statements</b> in this language, and for treating symbol structures composed of these <b>statements</b>, such that computer pro cesses based upon these rules can be said to extract meaning from these <b>statements</b> and to do operations based upon this meaning. The result is that the computer is able to find answers to a much wider range of questions about a specified <b>process</b> structure than it could if only the <b>structural</b> characteristics were discernible to it.<br><br>\"In our studying and designing <b>process</b> structures, we have found many ways to capitalize upon this more sophisticated question-answering capability now possessed by the computer. We are learning, for instance, how to get the computer to decide whether or not some types of design specificatlons are met, and if not, where the limitation exists. Or, perhaps we approach an already designed <b>process</b> structure which we think we can modify, or from which we can extract some useful sub-<b>process</b> that we contemplate incorporating into another <b>process</b> we are designing. We are getting terrific help in this type of instance, since we can now ask the computer direct questions about types of capability and limitation in this structure. The computer can even lead us directly to the particular design features from which these capabilities or limitations stem, and it is simple then to examine the descriptive and explanatory arguments linked thereto in order to see why these features were designed into the structure.<br><br>\"But I don't want to spend a disproportionate amount of time on the computer <b>process</b>es. The augmented man is engaged more often in structuring what we call composite <b>process</b>es than he is in structuring computer <b>process</b>es. For instance, planning a research project, or a day's work, are examples of structuring composite <b>process</b>es. A composite <b>process</b>, remember, is organized from both human <b>process</b>es and computer <b>process</b>es--which includes, of course, the possible inclusion of lower-order composite <b>process</b>es. The structuring here differs from that of a computer <b>process</b> mainly in the sophistication of the sub-<b>process</b>es which can be specified for the human to do. Some of these specifications have to be given in a language which matches the human's rich working framework of <b>concepts</b>--and we have been demonstrating here with English for that purpose--but quite a few human-executed <b>process</b>es can be specified in the high-level computer-<b>process</b>ing language even though we don't know how to describe them in that language. This means that there few composite-<b>process</b> structures about which the computer can answer very useful questions for us.<br><br>\"But to be more specific--we find that setting up objectives, deslgning a method of approach, and then implementing that method are of course our funda<b>mental</b> operating sequence--done over and over again in the manY levels of our activitY. We mentioned above what the characteristic <b>structural</b> difference was between computer <b>process</b>es and composite <b>process</b>es. But perhaps more important to us is the difference in the way we work with composite-<b>process</b> structures. Here is a crude but succinct way to put this. With the human contributing to a <b>process</b>, we find more and more as the <b>process</b> becomes complex that the value of the human's contribution depends upon how much freedom he is given to be disorderly in his course of action. For instance, we provide him as much help as possible in making a plan of action. Then we give him as much help as we can in carrying it out. But we also have to allow him to change his mind at almost any point, and to want to modify his plans. So, we provide augmentation help to him for keeping track of his plans where he is in them, what has been happening in carrying them out to date--and for evaluating possibilities that might occur to him for changing the plans. In fact, we are even learning how the computer can be made to watch for some kinds of plan-change possibilities, and to point them out to the human when they arise.<br><br>\"Here's a simple example of this sort of help for the human. Last winter, we designed a computer <b>process</b> that can automatically monitor the occurrence of specified types of computer usage over a specified period of time, and which, from the resulting data, can deduce a surprising amount of information regarding how the human made use of that time. This was quite helpful to us for evaluating our ways of doing things. Then we added more features to the program, in which the computer occasionally interrupts the human's activity and displays some questions to be answered. From these answers, together with its normal monitoring data, the program can provide evaluative data regarding the relative success of his different work methods. Our augmentation researchers became intrigued by this angle and bore down a little on it. They came up with a package <b>process</b> which gives the human many different types of feedback about his progress and way of doing things. Now, as part of my regular practice, I spend about five minutes out of each hour exercising with this package. This almost always reveals things to me that change at least the slant of my approach during the next hour, and often stimulates a relatlvely significant change in my short-range plans<br><br>\"You appreciate, of course, that I accomplish many more meaningful steps in an hour now than I used to, or than would be your norm now. This once-an-hour review for me now might compare with a once-a-day review for you, as far as the distance travelled between reviews is concerned.<br><br>\"Our way of structuring the statement of our objectives, the arguments which lead to the design of our plans, and the working <b>statements</b> of our plans, has been influenced by this review <b>process</b>. We found special types of tags and descriptive codes which we could append to these respective planning structures as we developed them which later facilitated our man-computer cooperative review of them. Also, our methods of developing these structures have evolved to facilitate their later modification. For instance, every basic consideration upon which a given planning statement is based is linked to that statement as a matter of standard argument structuring. But we have taken to linking special tagging codes into these argument structures involving our planning, to identify for the computer some of the different types of dependency relationships in the antecedent linkages. Later, if we consider changing the plan, these special tags often enable us to make use of some special computer <b>process</b>es that automatically isolate the considerations relevant to a particular type of change we have in mind.<br><br>\"Maybe an example will help here. There is a plan I am currently using for the way I go about entering miscellaneous scraps of infcrmation lnto my total symbol structure. It is designed so that there will be a good chance for these scraps later to be usefully integrated. It turns out that this plan is closely coupled in its design argument to the general plan for reviewing <b>process</b> structures--and symbol-structures, too, for that matter. Recently, I got an idea as to how I might add a little feature to that <b>process</b> that specially suited my particular way of wanting to deal with miscellaneous thoughts that I get. By various means, I very quickly learned that this would be easy to do if I could but reverse the order ln whlch I execute the sub-<b>process</b> Steps A and B, when I enter a piece of lnformation. I had to find out if I could safely reverse their order without getting into trouble someplace in my system.<br><br>\"This I could do relatively rapidly, by your standards, by snooping down the antecedent <b>trails</b>, looking for <b>statements</b> relevant to this timing question. There is, in fact, a semi-automatic <b>process</b>es available to me for speeding just such searches. The computer keeps track of where I have looked, where I've marked things as yes, or no, or possible, and does the bookkeeping and calculating necessary to guide me through an optimum search strategy. But the special tagging we do when we make a <b>process</b> structure lets this search be fully automatic when certain kinds of relationships are involved--and relative timing happens to be one of these relationships.<br><br>\"So I phrased a question which essentially asked for considerations relevant to the order in which these two steps were executed, and turned the computer loose. It took about three seconds for the results to be forthcoming--you haven't yet seen me request a task that took a noticeable period of machine time, have you? But anyway, the computer discovered a relevance trail that ended up showing that reversing the order of Steps A and B during the information-scrap entry <b>process</b> would cripple a certain feature in the planning-review <b>process</b>, where miscellaneous thoughts and possibilities are gleaned from this store to be considered relative to the planning.<br><br>\"But let's try to back away from details for a bit, now, and see if we can get a feeling for the significance of the things we've been talking about. Comparison with other working domains would be helpful, perhaps. If you were an inventor of useful mechanisms, you would like to have a wide range of materials-<b>process</b>ing and shaping techniques available to you. This would give you more freedom and more interesting possibilities in the way you worked and designed. But many of these techniques are very specialized; they require special equipment, special skills to execute the <b>process</b>ing and shaping, and special knowledge about applicability and possibillties for the techniques.<br><br>\"Suppose you were told that you could subscribe to a community- owned installation of special equipment--containing all sorts of wonderful instruments tools and machines for measuring and <b>process</b>ing with such as chemical, optical, mechanical, electronic, pneumatic, vacuum, metallurgy, and human factors. But this wasn't all that was included in the subscription. There would be a specialist assigned to you, instantly available for consultation and help whenever you requested it. He wouldn't have high-level theoretical trainlng. His specialty would be familiarity with the special manuals compiled from what the theoreticians, equipment builders, and technicians know, and being able to pinpoint relevant data and apply complex rules and specifications.<br><br>\"A lot of questions you might ask he couldn't answer directly, but in such a case he could often lead you quickly to some relevant pages in his books. You discovered that usually a succession of well-chosen questions of the sort he could answer, interspersed with your occasional study of succinct and relevant material he'd dig up for you, could very rapidly develop answers to conceptually sophisticated questions. His help in your minute-by-minute designing work could be extremely valuable-- availing you of quick and realistic consideration of a great many new design possibilities.<br><br>\"Similarly, when it came to carrying out a planned set of operations, it turned out that he couldn't carry out all of the <b>process</b>es for you--he could manage complex rules and procedures beautifully, but he would break down when it came to steps that required what you might call a larger view of the situation. But this wasn't so bad. The set of routine <b>process</b>es which he could manage all alone still provided you with a great deal of help--in fact, you got to developing ways to build things so as to capitalize upon his efficiency at these tasks. Then the <b>process</b>es which were too much for him would be done by the two of you together. He filled in all the routine stuff and you took care of the steps that were beyond his capability Often the steps you had to take care of were buried in the middle of a complex routine whose over-all nature didn't have to be understood by either of you for proper execution. Your helper would keep track of the complex procedure and execute all the steps he could. When he came to a step that was too big for him, he would hand you enough information to allow you to take that step, whereupon he would take over again until he met another such step.<br><br>\"As an inventor and bullder of devices that solve needs, you could become a great deal more versatile and productive, applying your imagination, intuition, judgment, and intelligence very effectively over a much wider range of possibilities. You could tackle much more complex and sophisticated projects, you could come up with very much better results--neater, cheaper, more reliable, more versatile, higher-quality performance--and you could work faster. Your effectiveness in this domain of activity would be considerably increased.<br><br>\"So let's turn back to the working domain which we are considering here. It is an intellectual one, where the <b>process</b>ing and shaping done is of conceptual material rather than physical material. But between these two types of working domains we nonetheless find closely analogous conditions relative to the variety and sophistication of the <b>process</b>es and techniques applicable to what nonroutine workers do. Consider the intellectual domain of a creative problem solver, and listen to me rattle off the names of some specialized disciplines that come to mind. These esoteric disciplines could very possibly contribute specialized <b>process</b>es and techniques to a general worker in the intellectual domain: Formal logic--mathematics of many varieties, including statistics-- decision theory--game theory--time and motion analysis--operations research--classification theory--documentation theory--cost accounting, for time, energy, or money--dynamic programming--computer programming. These are only a few of the total, I'm sure.<br><br>\"This implies the range of potentially applicable <b>process</b>es. Realize that there is also a correspondingly large list of specialized materials potentially usable in the fabrications of the intellectual worker. I speak, of course, about the conceptual material in the many different flelds of human interest. The things that I have been de monstrating to you this afternoon were designed to increase significantly the range of both <b>process</b>es and materials over which a human can practically operate within this intellectual domain. You might say that we do this by providing him with a very fast, agile vehicle, equipped with all sorts of high-performance sensory equipment and navigational aids, and carrying very flexible, powerful, semi-automatic devices for operating upon the materials of this domain. Not only that, but to provide an accurate analogy, we have to give him a computer to help him organize and monitor his activity and assess his results. We get direct help on many levels of activity in our system, you see.<br><br>\"But back to the topic of tools, and the analogy of the inventor who was given the equipment and the helper. Our augmented intellectual worker gets essentially this same kind of service, only more so--a compounding of this kind of service. Structuring our <b>process</b>es with care and precision enables the computer to answer limited questions, to guide you to relevant descriptions and specifications within its structure, to execute complex but limited-grasp <b>process</b>es on its own, and to take care of complex rule and procedure-following bookkeeping in guiding the execution of sophisticated composite <b>process</b>es. This actually makes it practical to use many specialized <b>process</b>es and techniques from very esoteric fields--to assess their applicability and limitations quickly, to incorporate them intelligently into the design and analysis of possible courses of action, and to execute them efficiently.<br><br>\"Our specialized <b>process</b>es represent a beautiful collection of special tools. These tools are designed by specialists, and they come equipped with operating instructions, trouble-shooting hints, and complete design data. Furthermore, we are provided with other tools that help us determine the applicability of these tools by automatically operating upon the instruction manual for us. Further, if something goes wrong with one of these tools, if we want to design a new tool of our own and make use of one of its modular components, or if we want to rearrange some of its adjustable features, we get considerable help in learning what we have to know about its design, and in making adjustments or coupling a part of it to another tool. Our shop contains an efficient tool-making section, where we can design and build our own tools from scratch, or by incorporating parts or all of any other tools we have.<br><br>\"Let me tell you of an interesting feature stemming from my using such improved Process-structuring techniques. An effective job of breaking down a complex problem into humanly manageable steps--and this is essentially what we seek in our <b>process</b> structuring--will provide the human with something to do at every turn. This may be to ponder or go searching, true enough--we aren't saying that the steps are necessarily straightforward. But the point I want to make is that no longer am I ever at a loss as to what to do next. I get stuck at times, to be sure, but when I do I have clean and direct ways to satisfy myself that I should just beat away at that roadblock for the time being.<br><br>\"And then, for beating away at the roadblock, my bookkeeping regarding what I've tried, what possibilities I've collected, and what my assumptions and objectives are, is good enough to help tremendously in keeping me from getting into loops and quandaries,in carefully ex hausting possibilities, and in really analyzing my assumptions and objectives. What's more, I'm not generating reams of cyclic arguments, lists, calculations, or the like--either I'm checking the validity of what I've already structured, or I am correcting or expanding the structure. In other words, it seems that the growth of my comprehension is sure and steady up to the point at which I succeed or give up. If I give up, I leave a structure which is very well organized to accommodate a subsequent revisit with new data, possibilities, assumptions, objectives, or tools. Also, I set up a sentinel <b>process</b> that will operate in the future to help alert me to <b>concepts</b> which may clear the block.<br><br>\"This feature, of always having satisfying actions to perform, and having a good feeling that they are what I should be doing at that time, gives a surprisingly contented, eager, and absorbing flavor to my work. I guess it's an adult instance of the sort of change observed in students when they were given teaching machines that provided continuous participation and reinforcement.<br><br>\"Anyway, with the quick flexibility available to me for structuring arguments, and semi-automatic application of special tagging and linking rules, I find it really quite easy to construct, use, or modify sophisticated <b>process</b> structuring. And I can turn right around and apply this toward improving my abllity for structuring argumentg and <b>process</b>es. The initial, straightforward capabilities for manipulating symbol structures, that were more or less obviously availed me by the computer have given to me a power to participate in more sophisticated <b>process</b>es that capitalize more fully upon the computer's capability--<b>process</b>es which are very significant to my net effectiveness, and yet which weren't particularly apparent to us as either possible or useful in the days before we started harnessing computers to the human's workaday activities in this direct way.'<br><br>7. Team Cooperation<br><br>\"Let me mention another bonus feature that wasn't easily fore seen. We have experimented with having several people work together from working stations that can provide inter-communication via their computer or computers. That is, each person is equipped as I am here, with free access to the common working structures. There proves to be a really phenomenal boost in group effectiveness over any previous form of cooperation we have experienced. They can all work on the same symbol structure, wherever they might wish. If any two want to work simultaneously on the same material, they simply duplicate and each starts reshaping his version--and later it is easy to merge their contributions. The whole team can join forces at a moment's notice to 'pull together' on some stubborn little problem, or to make a group decision. Most points of contention are resolved quite naturally, over a period of time, as the developing structure of argument bears out one, or the other, or neither stand.<br><br>\"No one can dominate the show, since seldom do you have to 'listen' to the person concurrent to the developments he is pursuing-- and yet at any time another person can tune in on what he has done and is doing. One can either take immediate personal issue with another about some feature, anywhere in the structure where he might find something done by the other to which he wants to take issue, or he can append his objection and the associated argument there where the disagreement lies, and tag this with a special cue that signals a point of contention that must ultimately be resolved. Any idea of the moment by any member can easily be linked to where it can do some good. It gets to be like a real whing-ding free-for-all--tremendously stimulating and satisfying, and things really get done. You find yourself 'playing over your head' almost all of the time.<br><br>\"We have been experimenting with multi-disciplinary teams and are becoming especially excited over the results. For instance, there is a great reduction of the barrier that their different terminologies used to represent, where one specialist couldn't really apply his experien ce, intuition, or conceptual feel very well unless the situation could be stated and framed in his accustomed manner, and yet the others couldn't work with his terminology. Here, they meet at their concept and terminology interface and work out little shifts in meaning and use which each can find digestible in his system, and which permit quite precise definitions in each system of the terms and <b>concepts</b> in the others. In studying the other's structuring then, either of them can have his own definitions automatically substituted for the other's special terms. Reduce this language barrier, and provide the feature of their being able to work in parallel independence on the joint structure, and what seems to result is amplification of their different capabilities.<br><br>\"Remember the term, synergesis, that has been associated in the literature with general structuring theory? Well, here is something of an example. Three people working together in this augmented mode seem to be more than three times as effective in solving a complex problem as is one augmented person working alone--and perhaps ten times as effective as three similar men working together without this computer-based augmentation. It is a new and exhiliarating experience to be working in this independent-parallel fashion with some good men. We feel that the effect of these augmentation developments upon group methods and group capability is actually going to be more pronounced than the effect upon individuals methods and capabilities, and we are very eager to increase our research effort in that direction.\"<br><br>8. Miscellaneous Advanced Concepts<br><br>\"I have dragged you through a lot of different <b>concepts</b> and methods so far. I haven't been complete because we won't have the time. But I have selected the sample features to present to you with an eye toward giving you a maximum chance to identify these as being something significant to your own type of work. I avoided discussing techniques applicable to esoteric problem-solving <b>process</b>es--although some of them display especially stimulating possibilities to those with appropriate backgrounds. The ability to structure arguments organized in English-language <b>statements</b>, and to make use of the linking and tagging capabilities at all levels of the structure, can be seen to lead to many interesting and promising new capabilities for organizing your thoughts and actions. I think you could picture learning these tricks and using them in your own work.<br><br>\"What I hoped to avoid by presenting the system in this way, was losing your identification with these possibilities by letting you get the mistaken impression that an individual couldn't harness these techniques usefully unless he first learned a lot of very sophisticated new language, logic and math. It is true that the more of the sophisticated tricks you learn, the more computer power you can harness and the more powerful you become--but very significant and personally thrilling practical problem-solving capabilities have been developed by quite a few subjects who were given only fifteen hours of training at one of these stations. The training, incidentally, was all provided by the computer without the presence of a human instructor. And the people were of such diverse fields as sociology, biology, engineering management, applied mathematics, and law. These were all relatively high-level people, and they were completely and unreservedly unanimous in their faith that their increased capability would easily justify the capital and operating outlay that we predicted for work stations of this sort in five years, if the computer industry really were to take this type of potential market seriously.<br><br>\"What these people became capable of was somewhat less than the range of capabilities that we have discussed so far--but they would find it very natural to develop further techniques on their own, and new teaching programs could be provided them so that they could continue learning the improved techniques turned out by a research group such as ours here.<br><br>\"But let me give you a brief view of some of the more advanced <b>concepts</b> and techniques that have evolved here, compatible with, but beyond, what I have so far shown you. And evolved is a good word to use here, because our appreciation for the potential worth of possibilities to be developed had to evolve too, and only came with the experience and perspective gained in our earlier work.<br><br>\"For instance, we initially felt that defining categories and relationships, and making a plan for action, were things to be done as quickly as possible so that we could get on with the work. But, as our means developed for dealing with definitions and plans more precisely, easily, and flexibly, we began to realize that they in reality might be the most significant part of that work. With our immenseiy increased capability for complex bookkeeping relative to our interlaced <b>hierarchies</b> of objectives, plans, and arguments, we found that defining a new cate gory, searching for members or instances of it, or applying its selection criteria were becoming ever conscious and specific tasks.<br><br>\"For instance, we began to find it more and more useful to distinguish different categories or types of <b>process</b>, different types of arguments, different types of relationships, and different types of descriptions. For a specific example, Ranganathan1 once cited five specific relationships that could obtain between two terms, where one modifies the other. He called these phase relations, and named how one term could relate to the other as either biasing it, being a tool used to study it, being an aspect of it, being in comparison with it, or influencing it. Vickery gave more examples, saying one could also have an effect on the other, be a cause of it, be a use for it, be a substitute for it, a source for it, an implication of it, be an explanation of it, or be a representation of it. There are even more categories mentioned in the literature.<br><br>\"It was easy to form tags and links, and we experimented with the gains to be made by consciously specifying and indicating categories. It turned out to be a very invigorating innovation, and we began to take more pains with our s.tructuring. It took longer to set up links and nodes in our structures, to be sure, but we found on the one hand that the structures became much cleaner and required fewer members, and on the other hand that we could get considerably more sophisticated help from the computer in doing significant chores for us.<br><br>\"We began to work up <b>process</b>es that would help us establish categories, give them good definitions, check their relationship with other established categories, decide whether something fit a given category or not, search for all possible members of it within a given <b>substructure</b>, and so forth. The very fact of using this careful classifi cation within our structures allowed us to get more powerful help from the computer in these classification <b>process</b>es. I should mention that the relationships among the terms in a sentence--the syntax if you wish--had been given further specification tags than those I showed you earlier, to remove ambiguities that hindered the computer from going back to a statement and resolving the syntactical structure. Also, ambiguities in the meaning of the terms began to limit us, and we developed methods for removing a good deal of this semantic ambiguity. This slowed us down, as I've mentioned, but not as much as you'd think.<br><br>\"Let me demonstrate one of the advanced <b>process</b>es which has evolved. It is heavily dependent upon the very care in building structures that it so nicely facilitates, and also upon several other developments. One of these other developments stems from the <b>concepts</b> and techniques of the semantic differential, as first introduced by Osgood, Suci, and Tannenbaum2 back in 1957, and from some subsequent work by Mayer and Bagley3 on what they called semantic models. These offered useful possibilities for establishing quite precisely what meaning a concept has to an individual, relative to his general conceptual framework, and for representing this meaning in a specific way that was amenable to computer manipulation.<br><br>\"The other development upon which this <b>process</b> to be exhibited is based, was stimulated by our realizing that flexible cooperation with the computer was calling for lots of little interactions. Our working repertoire of small-task requests for computer service was getting quite large, and it was proving to be extremely valuable to use them and to be able to remember automatically their procedures and designation codes. One of our research psychologists had worked on human-memory phenomena before he came with us, and had interested himself in mnemonic aids of all sorts. He has developed some useful techniques for us to use in connection with this, and other problems. Now let me demonstrate this example of an advanced <b>process</b> for helping work with categories.<br><br>\"Suppose that I want to establish a new category. Let's say that I have developed its description in what you and I have been calling an argument structure. I want to give it a name--a short and meaningful one--and I want a good definition. In fact, I want a definition that the computer can later work with. Look, I'll dig up a description that is awaiting such a definition, and you can watch what happens.\" So saying, Joe drummed on his keysets for a moment, with one interruption when the computer flashed something on the screen that was apparently a question about what he was asking the computer to find for him. He finally had a network display on one screen and a set of \"exploded\" <b>statements</b> on the upper half of the other.<br><br>\"I'm initiating the naming and defining <b>process</b> now, and de signating to it the argument structure represented by this network as what I want named and defined. Watch what happens.\" A few more strokes on the keyset, and he picked up his light pen in anticipation and waited a few moments. A statement appeared in the lower half of the second frame. He studied it a moment, then looked at the <b>statements</b> above, picked out a node on the network with the pen, and hit the keyset a few strokes. Another statement flashed on almost immediately, with two familiar adjectives placed below and a graduated line between them. Joe studied this, referred to the <b>statements</b> above, flipped through several levels of network portrayals, through a few <b>statements</b> representing a couple of low-level nodes, reflected a moment, and then pointed his light pen at a point on the graduated line, part way between the adjectives, and pressed its button.<br><br>\"Actually, right now I'm demonstrating a cooperative <b>process</b> execution technique. This <b>process</b> is applying some very sophisticated criteria and using some very sophisticated analytical techniques, and it is set up so that it is actually the computer that is now in the executive seat. I called for the <b>process</b>, but its execution essentially involves the computer's asking me questions, and feeding me successive questions according to how I've answered the previous ones. It also is doing a lot of work on the symbol structure that represents my description. It, with some small help from me, is proceeding through a quite complex analysis of the meaning that this incipient concept has to me, and of certain types of <b>mental</b> associations that I may have with it. I don't have to remember the special rules and forms of analysis involved-- nevertheless, a very sophisticated little capability is mine to use at will, taxing neither me nor the computer.\"<br><br>After a little over a minute of these question-answer interactions, the <b>process</b> apparently terminated, with four lines of special terms remaining on the screen. \"This first line gives me two suggested names for this category or concept. The first term is a newly coined formal name, while the remaining three terms represent a compound expression, involving established <b>concepts</b>, that can be used also as a designation of the new category. The second line furnishes me with an association chain to use for a mnemonic aid in remembering the new name-- linking the name to several characteristics of the concept. The name itself was selected under mnemonic criteria, as well as to have a structure that goes with its syntactic and semantic categories. The third line lists the names of some previously defined categories or <b>concepts</b> that are the closest to this in meanlng--these before the break were found to overlap, and the rest are just close.<br><br>\"The fourth line you recognize as a statement form, perhaps. This is the definition, as developed by the computer. It's in a special language and I won't try to explain. I'll just mention that I can now study it, take it apart, check its references, so to speak, and perhaps even see if the computer and I might work out any changes or improvementS But this <b>process</b> has been worked on pretty hard, and we're getting definitions that are hard to improve.<br><br>\"This special language, in which I said the definition was stated, is a recent development. We had found that the types of structuring we were developing had a lot of extra tags and links that were traceable to the complexity of the rules and combinatorial possibilities of the English language with which the <b>statements</b> were construct We finally got a clear enough picture of the requirements we place upon a language in our use here that we could consider designing our own special language. It turned out to be a straightforward and rather simple language compared with English, but much more precise and powerful. It proves rather inflexible and awkward to use for speaking, but it provides plenty of flexibility and power for expressing things in the visual-symbol forms that we use. Its precision leaves no syntactic ambiguity in a well-formed statement, and makes it much easier to reduCe semantic ambiguity to the point where the computer can deal with our <b>statements</b> much as it can with mathematical or formal-logic expressionc<br><br>\"It is worth mentioning, too, that we are experimenting with standard ways of structuring arguments at levels higher than the state ments--sort of a super grammar or syntax, with rules for assembling argument modules of different function lnto what becomes a well-formed higher-level argument module. There are some mixed feelings around here about this possibility, but I myself have become very much excited by it.<br><br>\"Also we have been introducing formal methods for manipulating what you might call reasonable <b>statements</b>--as opposed to absolute true false <b>statements</b> which the more familiar formal logic can manipulate. This finds approval and faith in all of us here, but it is going a bit slowly.<br><br>\"Let's run over some of the results we've seen to date, stemming from this new language and the new semantic awareness thus given the computer. If it can get hold of and manipulate important aspects of the meaning that is contained in our structures, it can develop answers to some questions for which there existed only conceptually implicit data. With practice and good strategy, asking questions like this proves to be a tremendously effective way to gain comprehension about a structure. We even have special <b>process</b>es and symbol-structuring methods to help organize the questioning and the answers. Some of the answers are a bit costly, however--in computer time and charges--and we have to watch the way we ask questions. Some of our researchers are studying the language and structuring techniques relative to this problem, and they think they see ways to change them to make question answering generally more efficient. But this sort of thing will likely always have its cost problems, as far as we can see now.\"<br><br>He went on to say that the computer now represents such an intelligent helper--although much less so than any human helper they would hire--that they refer to it as the Clerk. They can make a tentative new statement in the development of a structure, and have the clerk look over the structure to detect inconsistency or redundancy. The Clerk can also point out some of the weaknesses in the statement, as well as some of the effects of the statement upon the rest of the structure. They find that they need to give less and less human concern for the details of structure building--in-fact, the roles have reversed a little. Where the human used to set up tags and links so the computer could find its way around the structure as it ran errands for him, they now have the computer studiously installing similar things that are for the benefit of the human when he is studying the structure.<br><br>He also mentioned a recently developed computer <b>process</b> that could go back over a record of the human actions involved in establishing a given argument structure and do a creditable job of picking out the steps which contributed the most to the final picture--and also some of those that contributed least. This <b>process</b>, and some of the past data collected by its use, were becoming an important addition to the planning review sessions, as well as to the continuing development of improved methods. And apparently, it had a surprisingly positive psychological effect upon members of a cooperating team, where an objective means of relative scoring was thus available.<br><br>- - -<br><br>Let yourself be disengaged now from your role in the above discussion-demonstration. You have been through an experience that was designed to give you a feel for the sort of future developments that (to us) are predictable from our conceptual framework. What is presented in Section II is an attempt at giving a \"straight\" presentation of the various conceptual segments of this framework, and Section III hopefully supplemented the formal presentation to provide you with a more complete picture of how we are oriented and what sorts of possibilities impel us.<br><br>Assuming that we have communicated our conceptual framework in some reasonable form, we proceed below to discuss the question of what to do about it. Our approach to this question is with the view that energetic pursuit of this research could be of considerable significance to society, and that research should stem from a big enough picture of the over-all possibilities so that the contribution of any program, large or small, could have maximum long-range significance. Our recommendations are fairly general, and are cast in rather global terms, but we assert that they can be readily recast into the specific terms required of research planning to be done for a given project, within a given set of subgoals and research-activity constraints. In fact, we are now engaged in the <b>process</b> of so recasting these general recommendations into specific plans (for the experi<b>mental</b> research to be pursued here at Stanford Research Institute).<br><br>IV. RESEARCH RECOMMENDATIONS<br><br>A. OBJECTIVES FOR A RESEARCH PROGRAM<br><br>The report has put forth the hypothesis that the intellectual effectiveness of a human being is dependent upon factors which are subject to direct redesign in pursuit of an increase in that effectiveness. A conceptual framework is offered to help in giving consideration to this hypothesis, and an extensive and personalized projection into possible future developments is presented to help develop a feeling for the possi bilities and promise implicit in the hypothesis and conceptual structure.<br><br>If this hypothesis and its glowing extrapolations were borne out in future developments, the consequences would be most exciting and assumedly beneficial to a problem-laden world. What is called for now is a test of this hypothesis and a calibration on the gains if any that might be realized by giving total-system design attention to human intellectual effectiveness. If the test and calibration proved to be favorable, then we can set to work developing better and better augmentation systems for our problem solvers.<br><br>In this light, we recommend a research program approach aimed at (Goal 1) testing the hypothesis, (Goal 2) developing the tools and tech niques for designing better augmentation systems, and (Goal 3) producing real-world augmentation systems that bring maximum gains over the coming years to the solvers of tough, critical problems. These goals and the resulting design for their pursuit are idealized, to be sure, but the results nonetheless have valuable aspects.<br><br>B. BASIC RESEARCH CONDITIONS<br><br>This should be an empirical approach on a total-system basis--i.e., doing coordinated study and innovation, among all the factors admitted to the problem, in conjunction with experiments that provide realistic action and interplay among these variables. The question of limiting these factors is considered later in the section. The recommended en vironment for this empirical, total-system approach, is a laboratory providing a computer-backed display and communication system of the general sort described in Section III-B. There should be no stinting on the capabilities provided--it is very important to learn what value any given artifact feature may offer the total system, and the only way to learn the value is to experiment with the feature. At this point no time will be taken to develop elaborate improvements in the art of time sharing, to provide real-time service to many users. This kind of development should be done as separate, backup work. The experi<b>mental</b> lab should take the steps that are immediately available to provide all the service to the human that he needs in the experi<b>mental</b> environment.<br><br>Where economy demands that a computer not be idle during the time the augmented subject is not using it (which would be a rather large net fraction of the time, probably), and where sharing the computer with other real-time users for which demand delays are a problem, then the only sharing that should be considered is that with off-line computations for which there are no real-time service demands to be met. The computer can turn away from off-line users whenever the on-line worker needs attention of any sort.<br><br>C. WHOM TO AUGMENT FIRST<br><br>The experi<b>mental</b> work of deriving, testing, and integrating innovations into a growing system of augmentation means must have a specific type of human task to try to develop more effectiveness for, to give unifying focus to the research. We recommend the particular task of computer programming for this purpose--with many reasons behind the selection that should come out in the following discussion. Some of the more direct reasons are these:<br><br>1. The programmer works on many problems, including large and realistic ones, which can be solved without interaction with other humans. This eases the experi<b>mental</b>problem.<br>2. Typical and realistic problems for the programmer to solve can be posed for experi<b>mental</b> purposes that do not involve large amounts of working and reference in formation. This also eases the experi<b>mental</b> problem.<br>3. Much of the programmer's working data are computer programs (he also has, we assume, his own reasoning and planning notes), which have unambiguous syntactic and semantic form so that getting the computer to do useful tasks for him on his working data will be much facilitated--which helps very much to get early experience on the value a human can derlve from this kind of computer help.<br>4. A programmer's effectiveness, relative to other programmers, can probably be measured more easily than would be the case for most other complex-problem solvers. For example, few other complex solutions or designs beside a program can so easily be given the rigorous test of Does it actually work?<br>5. The programmer's normal work involves interactions with a computer (although heretofore not generally on-line), and this will help researchers use the computer as a tool for learning about the programmer's habits and needs.<br>6. There are some very challenging types of intellectual effort involved in programming. Attempting to increase human effectiveness therein will provide an excellent means for testing our hypothesis.<br>7. Successful achievements in evolving new augmentation means which significantly improve a programmer's capability will not only serve to prove the hypothesis, but will lead directly to possible practical application of augmentation systems to a real-world problem domain that can use help.<br>8. Computer programmers are a natural group to be the first in the real world to incorporate the type of augmentation means we are considering. They already know how to work in formal methodologies with computers, and most of them are associated with activities that have to have computers anyway, so that the new tech niques, <b>concepts</b>, methods, and equipment will not seem so radical to them and will be relatively easy for them to learn and acquire.<br>9. Successful achievements can be utilized within the augmentation-research program itself, to improve the effectiveness of the computer programming activity involved in studying and developing augmentation systems. The capability of designing, implementing, and modifying computer programs will be very inlportant to the rate of research progress.<br><br>Workers in an augmentation-research laboratory are the most natural people in the world to be the very first users of the augmentation means they develop, and we think that they represent an extremely important group of people to make more effective at their work.<br><br>D. BASIC REGENERATIVE FEATURE<br><br>The feature brought forth in Reason 9 above is something that offers tremendous value to the research objectives--i.e., the feeding back of positive research results to improve the means by which the researchers themselves can pursue their work The plan we are describing here is designed to capitalize upon this feature as much as possible, as will be evident to the reader as he progresses through this section. This positive-feedback (or regenerative) possibility derives from the facts that: (1) our researchers are developing means to increase the effectiveness of humans dealing with complex intellectual problems, and (2) our researchers are dealing with complex intellectual problems. In other words, they are developing better tools for a class to which they themselves belong. If their initial work needs the unifying focus of concentrating upon a specific tool, let that tool be one important to them and whose improvement will really help their own work.<br><br>E. TOOLS DEVELOPED AND TOOLS USED<br><br>This close similarity between tools being developed and the tools being used to do the developing, calls for some care in our terminology if we want to avoid confusion in our reasoning about their relationship. Augmentation means will be used to name the tools being developed by the augmentation research. Subject lnformation will be used to refer to description and reasoning concerned with the subject of these tools (as opposed to the method of research), and subject matter will refer to both subject information and physical devices being incorporated as <b>artifacts</b> in the augmentation means being developed. Tools and techniques will be used to name the tools being used to do that research, and are likely here to include special additions to language, artifact, and methodology that particularly improve the special capabilities exercised in doing the research.<br><br>An integrated set of tools and techniques will represent an art of doing augmentation research. Although no such art exists ready-made for our use, there are many applicable or adaptable tools and techniques to be borrowed from other disciplines. Psychology, computer programming and physical technology, display technology, artificial intelligence, industrial engineering (e.g., motion and time study), management science, systems analysis, and information retrieval are some of the more likely sources. These disciplines also offer initial subject matter for the research. Because this kind of diagramming can help more later on, we represent in Fig. 3 the situation of the beginning research drawing upon existing disciplines for subject matter and tools and techniques.<br><br>The program begins with general dependence upon other, existing dis ciplines for its subject matter (solid arrow) and its tools and tech niques (dashed arrow). Goal 1 has been stated as that of verifying the basic hypothesis that concerted augmentation research can increase the intellectual effectiveness of human problem solvers.<br><br>Fig. 3 Initial Augmentation-Research Program<br><br>F. RESEARCH PLAN FOR ACTIVITY A l<br><br>The dominant goal of Activity A 1 (Goal 1, as in Fig 3) is to test our hypothesis. Its general pursuit of augmenting a programmer is designed to serve this goal, but also to be setting the stage for later direct pursuit of Goals 2 and 3 (i.e., developing tools and techniques for augmentation research and producing real-world augmentation systems).<br><br>Before we discuss the possible subject matter through which this research might work, let us treat the matter of its tools and techniques. Not too long ago we would have recommended (and did), in the spirit of taking the long-range and global approach, that right from the beginning of a serious program of this sort there should be established a careful and scientific methodology. Controlled experiments, with special re search subjects trained and tested in the use of experi<b>mental</b> new aug mentation means, careful monitoring, record-keeping, and evaluative procedures, etc. This was to be accompanied by a thorough search through disciplines and careful incorporation of useful findings.<br><br>Still in the spirit of the long-range and global sort of planning, but with a different outlook (based, among other things, upon an increased appreciation for the possibilities of capitalizing upon regeneration), we would now recommend that the approach be quite different. We basically recommend A 1 research adhering to whatever formal methodology is required for (a) knowing when an improvement in effectiveness has been achieved, and (b) knowing how to assign relative value to the changes derived from two competing innovations.<br><br>Beyond this, and assuming dedication to the goal, reasonable maturity, and plenty of energy, intelligence, and imagination, we would recommend turning loose a group of four to six people (or a number of such groups) to develop means that augment their own programming capability We would recommend that their work begin by developing the capability for composing and modifying simple symbol structures, in the manner pictured in Section III-B-2, and work up through a hierarchy of intermediate capabilities toward the single high-level capability that would encompass computer programming. This would allow their embryonic and free wheeling \"art of doing augmentation research to grow and work out its kinks through a succession of increasingly complex system problems--and also, redesigning a hierarchy from the bottom up somehow seems the best approach<br><br>As for the type of programming to tell them to become good at--tell them, \u00d1the kind that you find you have to do in your research.\" In other words, their job assignment is to develop means that will make them more effective at doing their job. Figure 4 depicts this schematically, with the addition to what was shown in Fig. 3 of a connection that feeds the subject-matter output of their research (augmentation means for their type of programming problems) right back into their activity as improved tools and techniques to use in their research.<br><br>Fig. 4 Regeneration<br><br>If they are making head way, it won't take any carefully worded criterion of effectiveness nor any great sophistication in measurement technique to tell that they are more effective with the augmentation means than without--being quicker to \"design and build\" a running program to meet given <b>process</b>ing specifications or being quicker to pick up a complex existing program, gain comprehension as necessary, and find its flaws or rebuild it. On the other hand, if no gains are really obvious after a year or so, then it is time to begin incorporating more science in their approach. By then there will be a good deal of basic orientation as to the nature of the problem to which \"science\" is to be applied.<br><br>What we are recommending in a way is that the augmented capability hierarchy built by this group represent more a quick and rough scaffolding than a carefully engineered structure. There is orientation to be derived from climbing up quickly for a look that will be of great value. For instance, key <b>concepts</b> held initially, that would have been laboriously riveted into the well-engineered structure, could well be rendered obsolete by the \u00d1view\" obtained from higher in the hierarchy. And besides, it seems best to get the quick and rough improvements built and working first, so that the research will benefit not only from the orientation obtained, but from the help that these improvements will provide when used as tools and techniques to tackle the tougher or slower possibilities. As progress begins to be made toward Goal l,the diagram of Fig. 3 will become modified by feeding the subject-matter output (augmentation means for computer programmers) back into the input as new tools and techniques to be used by the researchers.<br><br>We would suggest establishing a sub-activity within A 1, whose purpose and responsibility is to keep an eye on the total activity, assess and evaluate its progress and try to provide orientation as to where things stand and where attention might be beneficial.<br><br>A few words about the subject matter through which Activity A 1 may progress. The researchers will think of simple innovations and try them in short order--and perhaps be stimulated in the <b>process</b> by realizing how handy some new feature would be that would help them whip up trial <b>process</b>es in a hurry. They will know of basic capabllitles they want to work toward for structuring their argumentsJ their planning, their factual data, etc., 50 that they can more easily get computer help in developing themJ in analyzing and pursuing comprehension within themJ and in modifying or extending them. They wlll try different types of structuring and see how easy it ls to design computer <b>process</b>es to manipulate them or composite <b>process</b>es to do total useful work with them.<br><br>They can work up programs that can search through other programs for answers to questions about them--questions whose answers serve the <b>process</b>es of debugging, extending, or modifying. Perhaps there will be ways they adopt in the initial structuring of a program--e.g., appending stylized descriptive cues here and there--that have no function in the execution of that program, but which allow more sophisticated fact retrieval therein by the computer. Perhaps such cue tagging would allow development of programs which could automatically make fairly sophisticated modifications to a tagged program. Maybe there would evolve semi-automatic \"super-compilers,\" with which the programmer and the computer leap-frog over the obstacles to formulating exact specifications for a computer (or perhaps composlte) <b>process</b> and getting it into whatever programming language they use.<br><br>G. A SECOND PHASE IN THE RESEARCH PROGRAM<br><br>The research of A 1 could probably spiral upwards indefinitely, but once the hypothesis (see Section IV-A) has been reasonably verified and the first of our stated objectives satisfied, it would be best to re-organize the program. To describe our recommendation here, let us say that two research activies, A 2 and A 3, are set up in place of A 1. Whether A 1 is split, or turned into A 2 and a new group formed for A 3, does not really matter here--we are speaking of separate activities, corresponding to the responsible pursuit of separate goals, that will benefit from close cooperation.<br><br>To Activity A 2 assign the job of developing augmentation means to be used specifically as tools and techniques by the researchers of both A 2 and A 3. This establishes a continuing pursuit for Objective 2 of Section IY-A. A 2 will now set up a sub-activity that studies the problems of all the workers in A 2 and A 3 and isolates a succession of capabilities for which the research of A 2 will develop means to augment. Activity A 2 should be equipped with the best <b>artifacts</b> available to an experi<b>mental</b> laboratory.<br><br>To Activity A 3 assign the job of developing augmentation systems that can be practically adopted into real-world problem situations. This provides a direct and continuing pursuit of Goal 3 of Section IV-A. It is to be assumed that the first real-world system that A 3 will design will be for computer programmers. For this it might well be able to clean up the \u00d1laboratory model\" developed in A 1, modify it to fit the practical limitations represented by real-world economics, working environments, etc., and offer it as a prototype for practical adoption. Or Activity A 3 might do a redesign, benefitting from the experience with the first model.<br><br>Activity A 3 will need a subactivity to study its potential users and guide the succession of developments that it pursues. Activity A 2 in its continued pursuit of increased effectiveness among workers in idealized environment, will be the source for basic subject matter in the developments of A 3, as well as for its tools and techniques. From the continously expanding knowledge and developments of A 2, A 3 can organize successive practical systems suitable for ever more general utilization.<br><br>We have assumed that what was developed in A 1 was primarily language and methodology, with the <b>artifacts</b> not being subject to appreciable modification during the research. By this second phase, enough has been learned about the trends and possibilities for this type of on-line man-computer cooperation that some well-based guidance can be derived for the types of modifications and extensions to artifact capability that would be most valuable. Activity A 2 could continue to derive long-range guidance for equipment development, perhaps developing laboratory innovations in computers, display systems, storage systems, or communication systems, but at least experimenting with the incorporation of the new artifact innovations of others.<br><br>An example of the type of guidance derived from this research might be extracted from the <b>concepts</b> discussed in Section-C-5 (Structure Types). We point out there that within the computer there might be built and manipulated symbol structures that represent better images of the concept structures of interest to the human than would any symbol structure with which the human could work directly. To the human, the computer represents a special instrument which can display to him a comprehensible image of any characteristic of this structure that may be of interest. From our conceptual viewpoint, this would be a source of tremendous power for the human to harness, but it depends upon the computer being able to read all of the stored information (which would be in a form essentially incomprehensible to a human). Now, if this conjecture is borne out there would be considerably less value in micro-image information-storage systems than is now generally presumed. In other words, we now conjecture that future reference information will be much more valuable if stored in computer-sensible form. The validity of this and other conjectures stemming from our conceptual framework could represent critical questions to manufacturers of information systems.<br><br>It is obvious that this report stems from generalized large-view thinking. To carry this to something of a final view, relative to the research recommendations, we present Fig. 5, which should be largely self-explanatory by this time. Activity A 2 is lifting itself by the bootstraps up the scale of intellectual capability, and its products are siphoned to the world via A 3. Getting acceptance and application of the new techniques to the most critical problems of our society might in fact be the most critical problem of all by then, and Activity A 4 would be one which should be given special help from A 3.<br><br>There is another general and long-range picture to present. This is in regard to a goal for a practically usable system that A 3 would want to develop as soon as possible. You might call this the first general Computer Augmentation System--CAUG-I (pronounced cog-one).<br><br>Fig. 5: A Total Program<br>Suggested relationship among the major activities in achieving the stated objective (essentially, of significantly boosting human power in A 4 and U 1). Solid lines represent subject information or <b>artifacts</b> used or generated within an activity, and dashed lines represent special tools and techniques for doing the activity in the box to which they connect. Subject product of an activity (output solid) can be used as working material (input solid) or as tools and techniques (input dashed). Tools and techniques as used or needed in an activity (output dashed) can be used either to work on (input solid) or as tools and techniques to work with (input dashed).<br><br>It would be derived from what was assessed to be the basic set of capabilities needed by both a general-problem-solvlng human and an augmentation researcher. Give CAUG-I to a real-world problem solver in almost any discipline, and he has the basic capabilities for structuring his arguments and plans, organizing special files, etc., that almost anyone could expect to need. In addition to these direct-application on capabilities, however, are provided those capabilities necessary for analyzing problem tasks, developing and evaluating new <b>process</b> capabilities, etc., as would be required for him to extend the CAUG-I system to match to the special features of his problem area and the way he likes to work.<br><br>In other words, CAUG-I represents a basic problem-solving tool kit, plus an auxiliary tool-makers tool kit with which to extend the basic tool kit to match the particular job and particular worker. In subsequent phases, Activity A 3 could be turning out successive generations (CAUG-II, CAUG-III, etc.) each incorporating features that match an ever-more-powerful capability hierarchy in an ever-more-efficient manner to the basic capabilities of the human.<br><br>V. SUMMARY<br><br>This report has treated one over-all view of the augmentation of human intellect. In the report the following things have been done: (1) An hypothesis has been presented. (2) A conceptual framework has been constructed. (3) A \"picture\" of augmented man has been described. (4) A research approach has been outlined. These aspects will be re viewed here briefly:<br><br>1. An hypothesis has been stated that the intellectual effectiveness of a human can be significantly improved by an engineering-like approach toward redesigning changeable components of a system.<br>2. A conceptual framework has been constructed that helps provide a way of looking at the implications and possibilities surrounding and stemming from this hypothesis. Briefly, this framework provides the realization that our intellects are already augmented by means which appear to have the following characteristics:<br>\ta. The principal elements are the language <b>artifacts</b>, and methodology that a human has learned to use.<br>\tb. The elements are dynamically interdependent within an operating system.<br>\tc. The structure of the system seems to be hierarchical, and to be best considered as a hierarchy of <b>process</b> capabilities whose primitive components are the basic human capabilities and the functional capabilities of the <b>artifacts</b>--which are organized successively into ever-more-sophisticated capabilities.<br>\td. The capabilities of prime interest are those associated with manipulating symbols and <b>concepts</b> in support of organizing and executing <b>process</b>es from which are ultimately derived human compre hension and problem solutions.<br>\te. The automatlon of the symbol manipulation associated with the minute-by-minute <b>mental</b> <b>process</b>es seems to offer a logical next step in the evolution of our intellectual capability.<br>3. A picture of the implications and promise of this framework has been described, based upon direct human communication with a computer. Here the many ways in which the computer could be of service, at successive levels of augmented capability, have been brought out. This picture is fanciful, but we believe it to be conservative and representative of the sort of rich and significant gains that are there to be pursued.<br>4. An approach has been outlined for testing the hypothesis of Item (1) and for pursuing the \"rich and significant gains\" which we feel are promised. This approach is designed to treat the redesign of a capability hierarchy by reworking from the bottom up, and yet to make the research on augmentation means progress as fast as possible by deriving practically usable augmentation systems for real-world problem solvers at a maximum rate. This goal is fostered by the recommendation of incorporating positive feedback into the research development--i.e., concentrating a good share of the basic-research attention upon augmenting those capabilities in a human that are needed in the augmentation-research workers The real-world applications would be pursued by designing a succession of systems for specialists, whose progression corresponds to the increasing generality of the capabilities for which coordinated augmentation means have been evolved. Consideration is given in this rather global approach to providing potential users in different domains of intellectualactivity with the basic general-purpose augmentation system from which they themselves can construct the special featuresof a system to match their job, and their ways of working--or it could be used on the other hand by researchers who want to pursue the development of sepcial augmentation systems for special fields.<br><br>\t<br>VI. CONCLUSIONS<br><br>Three principal conclusions may be drawn concerning the significance and implications of the ideas that have been presented.<br><br>First any possibility for improving the effective utilization of the intellectual power of society's problem solvers warrants the most serious consideration. This is because man's problem-solving capability represents possibly the most important resource possessed by a society. The other contenders for first importance are all critically dependent for their development and use upon this resource. Any possibility for evolving an art or science that can couple directly and significantly to the continued development of that resource should warrant doubly serious consideration.<br><br>Second, the ideas presented are to be considered in both of the above senses: the direct-development sense and the 'art of development' sense. To be sure, the possibilities have long-term implications, but their pursuit and initial rewards await us now. By our view, we do not have to wait until we learn how the human <b>mental</b> <b>process</b>es work, we do not have to wait until we learn how to make computers more intelligent or bigger or faster, we can begin developing powerful and economically feasible augmentation systems on the basis of what we now know and have. Pursuit of further basic knowledge and improved machines will continue into the unlimited future, and will want to be integrated into the \"art\" and its improved augmentation systems--but getting started now will provide not only orientation and stimulation for these pursuits, but will give us improved problem-solving effectiveness with which to carry out the pursuits.<br><br>Third, it becomes increasingly clear that there should be action now--the sooner the better--action in a number of research communities and on an aggressive scale. We offer a conceptual framework and a plan for action, and we recommend that these be considered carefully as a basis for action If they be considered but found unacceptable, then at least serious and continued effort should be made toward developing a more acceptable conceptual framework within which to view the over-all approach, toward developing a more acceptable plan of action, or both.<br><br>This is an open plea to researchers and to those who ultimately motivate, finance, or direct them, to turn serious attention toward the possibility of evolving a dynamic discipline that can-treat the problem of improving intellectual effectiveness in a total sense. This discipline should aim at producing a continuous cycle of improvements--increased understanding of the problem, improved means for developing new aug mentation systems, and improved augmentation systems that can serve the world's problem solvers in general and this discipline's workers in particular. After all, we spend great sums for disciplines aimed at understanding and harnessing nuclear power. Why not consider developing a discipline aimed at understanding and harnessing \"neural power?\" In the long run, the power of the human intellect is really much the more important of the two.</div>",

            "<div id='overview_2'>This makes you recall dimly the generalizations you had heard previously about <b>process</b> <b><b><b><b><b><b>structuring</b></b></b></b></b></b> limiting <b><b>symbol</b></b> <b><b><b><b><b><b>structuring</b></b></b></b></b></b>, <b><b>symbol</b></b> <b><b><b><b><b><b>structuring</b></b></b></b></b></b> limiting <b><b>concept</b></b> <b><b><b><b><b><b>structuring</b></b></b></b></b></b>, and <b><b>concept</b></b> <b><b><b><b><b><b>structuring</b></b></b></b></b></b> limiting <b>mental</b> <b><b><b><b><b><b>structuring</b></b></b></b></b></b>.</div>",

The thirty-one useful hand-<b>stroke</b> finger combinations will represent different <b>input</b> <br>designations depending upon the current <b>interpretive</b> <b>case</b>. It is assumed that a computer will interpret these <b>code</b>s, although there may be paper-tape intermediate storage. <br><br>At present, I have the logic worked out for the <b>interpretive</b> program, but it is not <b>code</b>d. Judy has been using the full <b>code</b> in practice <b>transcription</b> onto 5-bit punched tape.<br><br>I will use the following naming conventions. For Code i, struck in Case n: Cn.i if i is expressed in decimal form, and Cn/i is expressed in octal form. The four printing <b>case</b>s and the Control Case have n of 1,2,3,4, and c respectively. It is often useful, in a.ctions designated from the Control Case, to return interpretation back to the printing <b>case</b> from which Control Case was last entered --and I designate this as Cx. Besides this, Cl, C2, C3, C4, Cc and Cn used alone will designate Cases 1,2,3,4, or Control Case, or any <b>case</b>, respectively. <br><br>To shift <b>case</b> one goes through the intermediate Control Case. For instance, to shift from Case 1 to Case 2, hit Cl.27 (shifting to Control Case) and Cc.2 (shifting from Control Case to Case 2). Hitting Cn.27 will always ensure being in Control Case. <br><br>1. \tPrinting Cases. <br>\u00a5 \tX ~ ~(... c.)He <br>Abbreviations of sorts are included. Codes Cl.l7 and C2.17 represent the <b>character</b> pair \"<b>qu</b>\" and \"QU\". If a \"q\" is desired without the \"u\", use ON Af Code C3.17 (or C4.17). Also, in Cases 1 and 2, Codes 29 and 30 designate more than nco:rrma\" and \"period.\" Code 29, labelled EOF for End Of Phrase, will designate the <b>character</b> pair \"comna space\". To get a comma without a space following it, use Codes C3.29 or C4.29. Code 30 (in Cases 1 and 2), labelled EOS for End Of Sentence, designates the following: \"period\", \"space\", \"space\", \"shift\" to Case 2 for one <b>character</b> and then to Case 1.\" To get a period, use Code 30 in either of Cases 3 or 4. If a Code 17 is hit after an EOS, the result will be the <b>character</b> pair 'Qu\". <br><br>In anticipation of a <b>qu</b>estion following the description of Codes Cc.l5 through Cc.l9--C4. 11, a Backspace <b>code</b>, bas the same effect as <b>backspacing</b> a typewriter. The originally written <b>character</b> p3.st which you backspace remain to be overprinted by succeeding printing <b>character</b>s. <br><br>2. Control Case. <br>In Control Case are a number of special features. Codes 1, 2, 3 and 4 designate direct transfer to the corresponding <b>case</b>. Codes 5, 6 and 7 are used for <b>underlining</b> alphabetic <b>character</b>s. </div><div id='full_0'><mark>Code 5 says, \"return to Cx (the <b>case</b> from which you most recently transferred t.o Control Case) and underline the next <b>character</b> designated,\" Code 6 will send you back to Cx and cause <b>underlining</b> of all succeeding alphabetic <b>character</b>s up to the next occurrence of a <b>code</b> of 28 or greater--essentially, <b>underlining</b> the next word.. Code 7 sends you back to ex and causes <b>underlining</b> of all alphabetic <b>character</b>s until an occurrence of either a Code 28 or a Code 30--for <b>underlining</b> section titles.</mark></div><div> For Codes Cc. 6 and Cc. 7, a hyphen will be assumed. as a legitimate \"alphabetic\" <b>character</b> to be underlined, but a. double hyphen (representing a dash) will be a terminater of the <b>underlining</b> action. For Cod.i!s Cc. 8 through Cc.l3 we designate a short one-<b>character</b> or \"one-word visit\" to a specified <b>case</b> before shifting back automatically to Cx. Special note: se<b>qu</b>ence Cc,8, C2.17 results in a printing se<b>qu</b>ence corresponding to C4. 26, Cx. 21. Similarly, a one-<b>character</b> visit to Code 17 of Case 1 would produce a \"q\" and a Code 21 from Cx. The \"one-word visit\" is terminated by any <b>code</b> e<b>qu</b>al or greater than 27 9 and that <b>code</b> will be interpreted as though it were in Cx. <br><br>Codes Cc. 15 through Cc. 19 -are used for <b>deleting</b> preceding <b>character</b>s. They all have the effect upon the eventual output text of <b>backspacing</b> a magic typewriter that erases any <b>character</b> in a position to which it backspaces. Cc.15 can be hit n times successively to cause n such effective backspace-deletes, each of which eats up one line space. Cc,l6 is used for the last of such a string of backspace-deletes (or when you just want one) if you want to transfer automtically thereafter back to ex. Cc. 17 will automatically do backspace-deletes back to but not including the previous \"space\" and then will transfer you back to Cx. Cc.l8 will automatically do backspace-deletes back to and including (i.e., through) the previous \"period,\" and then transfer you to Cx. Cc .19 will automatically do backspace-deletes back to an including (i.e. , through) the previous \"tab\", and then transfer you to Cx. IMPORTANT NOTE: A delete command is not actually executed until the next printing-<b>case</b> <b>code</b> other than Code 27.<br><br>Code Cc. 21, \"Hand Spec,\" is used as part of a procedure to tell the <b>interpretive</b> device which hand you are going to use on the keyset, Following recognition of this <b>code</b>, the computer will assume that the very next <b>input</b> <b>code</b> will use either or both the thumb and index finger but no others -- i.e. you must jump to Cl, C2 or C3 on the next <b>stroke</b>--and it deduces the specified hand from this <b>stroke</b>. </div><div id='full_4'><mark>Notice that getting to this <b>code</b> from any state can be done entirely with symmetrical <b>code</b>s (<b>code</b>s that are the same for both hands), so that it doesn't matter what hand the interpretation was assuming, or what <b>interpretive</b> <b>case</b> was being used, when you choose to use a give hand to specify the hand-interpretation made.</mark></div><div> (A Hand_Spec <b>code</b> automatically actuates a Cc.27 <b>code</b> as part of its response.) <br><br><br></div><div id='full_1'><mark>CONTROL CASE <br>CASE 1 <br>CASE 2 <br>CASE 3 <br>CASE 4 <br><br>Cx, underline next <br>alphabetic <b>character</b> <br>ex, underline alphabetic<br>until Code greater than 28 ex, underline alphateics<br>until Code 28 or 30 1-ch C2, Cx <br>Backspace-Delete <br>Backspace-Delete, Cx <br>Delete to SP, Cx <br>Delete thru .</mark></div><div> Cx <br>Delete thru TAB, Cx <br>Hand Spec. <br><br>Reset Control <br>EOP, Cx <br><br>Note: Cn refers to <b>case</b> N, where N = 1,2,3, or 4.<br>Co refers to Control Case.<br>Cx refers to Case from which last jumped to Cc.<br><br>Code Cc.27 (which in other <b>case</b>s ca~es transfer to control <b>case</b>) leaves you in control <b>case</b>, but clears any pending control action which the <b>code</b> interpreter may be writing to complete -- e.g. Blly of the underline, <b>case</b>-visit or delete actions. <br>Code Cc.28, labelled EOP for End Of Paragraph will automatically set up the output for a new paragraph. For typewriter output present convention, this would provide the se<b>qu</b>ence e<b>qu</b>ivalent to C3.50J> C3.313 C3.28, C3.281 C3.9, Cc.l, Cc.B. <br><br>3. Future Possibilities. <br>a. Extension of the above <br>Below are a few salient possibilities among the many that will undoubtedly be uncovered with future study. It will generally re<b>qu</b>ire coo~inated analysis of editorial conventions and occurrence fre<b>qu</b>encies to establish efficient <b>transcription</b> cades for an <b>interpretive</b> program of reasonable size and operating cost. <br>(1) Automatic Underlining. A number of odd conditions seem to arise in trying to specify how far ahead in the text you want printed <b>character</b>s to be underlined. Cc. 5 through Cc. 7 as designated above don't easlly handle all of these. More study is re<b>qu</b>ired of occurrence fre<b>qu</b>ency for such conditions before one could say how best to designate <b>code</b>s to handle them. <br><br>One new-<b>code</b> possibility, would say, return to Cx and underline all legitimte <b>character</b>s until a Cc. 27 <b>code</b> is struck. Perhaps several such would be useful, depending upon what are to be specified as legitimate <b>character</b>s (e.g. sometimes a space is underlined, sometimes not). <br><br>Another new-<b>code</b> possibility, call it Cc.j, would be used in a two-<b>stroke</b> se<b>qu</b>ence Cc.j, Cx.k, which is then to be followed by printing designations in Cx. Underlining will automatically occur, for all legitimate <b>character</b>s, up to and including the next occurrence of Code k in Case x. <br><br>(2) Automatic Delete (and Place Finding). In some situations, e.g. involving, prior <b>case</b>-shift, between-sentence and between-paragraph that are to be corrected, it is not clear that delete commands such as Cc.l5 through Cc.l9 provide the best facility for <b>deleting</b> and relocating. Especially for an off-line operator who can't see the effect of such commands as interpreted by the computer. Also, an off-line operator may become lost by losing track of recent <b>code</b> <b>stroke</b>s and/or their conse<b>qu</b>ences, and may need a straightforward way to relocate correctly. <br><br>A Control-Case <b>code</b> could be used to tell the interpreter: \"Go to Cc, observe the next word, W, that I enter and search backward until the first occurrence of W. Delete all old entry back through the old W, and, beginning with my new W entry, accept subse<b>qu</b>ent entry as normal continuation.\" If you got lost, you could thus go back and restart at a previous uni<b>qu</b>e word where you knew you had been doing all right. This command also allows flexible specification of deletion. <br><br>A variant of this <b>code</b> might be preferable, where you follow the Cc command <b>code</b> with a digit (or, two digits) that specify a number, n, The. interpreter is to observe the symbol string S composed of the next n <b>input</b> <b>character</b>, and use S (exactly as it would use W in the original variation) to locate the renewed starting point back in the prior <b>input</b>. <br><br>For on-line use with CRT feedback, one need not specify n in the latter variant of the command. He could (after giving the command) merely start entering <b>character</b>s and watching a \"place marker\" until the computer had enough <b>input</b> to have set the marker at the desired spots then hit two Code 27 <b>stroke</b>s to clear control and stop the search. <br><br>(3) First Person Singular. We can rather easily incorporate the convention that a Cl.B <b>code</b> (lower-<b>case</b> i) immediately preceded and followed by space <b>code</b>ss is to be outputted as if it were a C2.9 <b>code</b>. <br><br>(4) New Sections. This regards test-block categories larger than the paragraph. More study is needed, with establishment of consistent conventions for headings to sections of different levels. Automatic format help for these headings --e.g. capitalization and <b>underlining</b> -- could be obtained, as well as coordinated subse<b>qu</b>ent-paragraph indentation. A Cc Code (or set of them) could be used to designate a new section and the section type or level. This can include listings and <b>qu</b>oted inserts. <br><br>(5) Specifying Abbreviations. The \"<b>qu</b>\", EOF, EOS, underline, visit, delete, and EOP <b>code</b>s all are <b>abbreviations</b>, and further study of standard <b>transcription</b> message types will undoubtedly suggest other of the types. This section, however, concerns <b>abbreviations</b> the user may wish to establish temporarily or permanently for himself. <br><br>One Control-Case <b>code</b> could be used to declare that you were going to establish an abbreviation form. You then enter the full form (both control and data) of the <b>input</b> string you wish to abbreviate, and install a uni<b>qu</b>e separate <b>input</b> <b>code</b>. You follow with the uni<b>qu</b>e <b>character</b>s (abbreviation form, F) by which you wish to enter (designate) the abbreviation in the future. Henceforth, entry of the abbreviation form will automatically cause substitution of the full form to produce words and/or control se<b>qu</b>ences. <br><br>Another Cc <b>code</b> could be used to effect removal of a given abbreviation form -- and still another Cc <b>code</b> could be used to designate which group or groups of <b>abbreviations</b> you might wish to make use of -- if such would be useful. There could well be a standard set you would wish to use basically, to which in some given writing place you could usefully add some of your own. Unless you remembered these local-use additions, and could control their accumulation and discarding, it could be very handy to call for a fresh start with a standard group of <b>abbreviations</b>. <br><br>We could ask the interpreter to check every <b>input</b> word against a table of abbreviation forms -- or we could constrain all such forms to begin with one particular <b>character</b> (or one of a special set of <b>character</b>s) so that lookup was done for only those <b>input</b> words beginning with a special <b>character</b> -- or we could say that a special Cc <b>code</b> must accompany every <b>input</b> word which is to be interpreted as an abbreviation form. <br><br>Personally, I would think there are few enough normal words beginning with z or x to let one or both of them, as an initial <b>character</b> of a word, tell the interpreter to look at the abbreviation tabie. Using a special Cc <b>code</b> to designate thie, where this <b>code</b> has no other use, would seem to be of advantage mainly if you wanted feedback if the interpreter found no such abbreviation form in its table -- since with such as the Z or X designater we would have to let the interpreter point the <b>input</b> word if it didn't find it on the table. <br><br>(6) Control Trees. We could forsee possibility in the foregoing section of a number of different control commands associated with setting up or <b>deleting</b> abheviations. These wouldn't be too fre<b>qu</b>ently used, and Cc <b>code</b>s will become precious as we learn more use for them. For less-fre<b>qu</b>ent control commands, it could pay to bundle them in one or more second-level control <b>case</b>s to which entry is made from the first-level Control Case (the one we now have). For still-less-fre<b>qu</b>ent commands, third-level control <b>case</b>s might be fitting, etc. <br><br>b. Special Two-Handed Possibilities. Alternating two hands on two keysets definitely seems a usefUl possibility for faster <b>transcription</b>. The interpreter hal!l to keep track of which keyset provides a given entry, and separate Hand Spec procedure is needed for each keyset. Otherwise the string of se<b>qu</b>ential <b>input</b> <b>code</b>s is interpreted without regard for which keyset enters which <b>code</b>. <br><br>We can stipulate that the use, for this type of interpretation, never <b>overlaps</b> his key <b>stroke</b>s -- i.e. only one set of keys is depressed at a time. We can then etipulat.e that. if overlap exists, the two overlapped <b>code</b>s are to be interpreted differently. <br><br></div><div id='full_3'><mark>For instance, we may stipulate that a <b>code</b> <b>stroke</b> that ie held so as to be overlapped by the succeeding other-hand <b>stroke</b> is to be interpreted as a Cc <b>code</b> -- and with the succeeding overlap <b>code</b> being interpreted normally.</mark></div><div> But this only saves one <b>stroke</b>, and at the expense of a break in <b>stroke</b> rhythmn. I think there is better use to be made of overlap. <br><br><br>A better use would seem to stem from saying that the two overlapped five-bit <b>code</b>s are to be interpreted as an independent ten-bit <b>code</b>. This gives us 961 uni<b>qu</b>e <b>code</b>s for which to designate special <b>abbreviations</b>, control tricksj etc, and opens the door to a coordinated \"<b>shorthand</b>\" <b>code</b>. Phrases, words, n-grams (including spaces punctuation and control <b>character</b>s), whose payoff in fre<b>qu</b>ency of use times 5-bit <b>code</b> <b>stroke</b>s saved is large enough, would thus be en<b>code</b>d as single two-handed overlap <b>stroke</b>s. <br><br>It seems reasonable to say that it is the order of keyset actuation, rather than which hand actuates which <b>code</b>, that should determine the way the interpreter groups the two five-bit <b>code</b>s into a ten-bit <b>code</b>. This would seem less distrubing to the <b>character</b>-at-a-time alternate-hand rhythmn in which the <b>shorthand</b> <b>code</b>s would be embedded.<br><br>However, it would be possible for the order of overlapping -- which hand was first -- to be of significance, This could provide two independent 961-<b>code</b> <b>interpretive</b> repertoires. It is also possible to say that no pair, the interpretation gives the same designater role to the aame hand every time. <br><br>The <b>shorthand</b> forms can be remembered and <b>stroke</b>d as a pair of Cl <b>character</b>s rather than as a ten-bit <b>code</b>. Also this <b>shorthand</b> springs compatibly from the five-bit <b>character</b>-by-<b>character</b> <b>code</b>, and a person can gradually add new <b>shorthand</b> forms to his repertoire as his familiarity and skill grow. <br><br>c. More Code Forms Per Hand Stroke. I think that some or all of the fingers could probably control more than one bit per hand <b>stroke</b>. The pressure-sensitive <b>pads</b> (see CBC 4 OCT 63) will allow us rather easily to experiment. </div><div id='full_2'><mark>Two <b>pads</b> per finger gives five-level radix-3 <b>code</b>s (3 exp 5 = 243, yielding a 242-<b>code</b>-form hand <b>stroke</b>) and three <b>pads</b> per finger gives five-level radix-4 <b>code</b>s (4 exp 5 = 1024, a full ten-bits, yielding a 1023-<b>code</b>-form band <b>stroke</b>), It can be arranged that one finger can activate either or both of two <b>pads</b>, but this is e<b>qu</b>ivalent to a three-pad, one-out-of-three arrangement.</mark></div><div> <br><br>It remains to be learned how best there different <b>code</b>-forms-per-<b>stroke</b> and encoding possibilities can be used, I plan to experiment (Judy and me as subjects) on basic feasibility of these different approaches, but it would re<b>qu</b>ire a fUll-blown project to explore and evaluate meaningfully. </div>",

A \"coordinated working system\" is the focus for planning. <br><br>2. Miscellaneous facility for handling documentation files can be shown, but in a realtively short time, we couldn't make too much <b>headway</b> on an integrated working system covering all of our file systems within the allotted time--that is, <b>headway</b> to have unusual facility in using them. <br><br>3. The area where it would seem we could make <b>headway</b>, in an integrated sense, would be in the programming design and checkout area of activity. For instance, suppose we concentrated upon the following: <br><br>a. Realmtime feedback in checking out and debugging. In FKT 12 NOV 63 there are a number of suggestions, but only three of the nine seem likely within a relatively few <b>months</b>: Items 5, 6 and 9, i.e. stopping operations at any point with flexible hard-copy printouts available and easy way of <b>restarting</b> at same point, an accounting on request of machine times with additional feature of being able to set time limits on runs, and a flexible choice of real-time traces with automatic dumping and <b>restarting</b>. Perhaps other possibilities can be assembled and evaluated. Will need to assess the potential state of our basic system facility for the <b>months</b> ahead in order to determine which real-time feedback processes are feasible to consider implementing and integrating into the working system. <br><br>b. Constructing and using process-structuring <b>records</b> in the design, debugging, <b>modification</b> and docmentation (for others) of computer programs. Without too much new programming required, but with establishment of conventions, <b>terminology</b> am procedures, we should be able to do some very useful and interesting things. <br><br>4. Discussion of some process-structure design-recording possibilities: <br><br>a. John Wensley has described to me in the past some notions about the tabulations and <b>labelling</b> that might be appended (automatically or semi-automaticallY) to the listings of <b>instruction</b>s (listed in symbolic form). I don't remember the details, but I believe that he mostly was considering at the time the possibilities within the scope of aids that a human clerk could provide--but some of the aids could be made automatic. <br><br>b. In this level of work, with the <b>instruction</b>s that are fed to a compiler or assembler, the record established within computer store for a real-time computer aided interrogation, or established on hard copy for offline use, would seem to offer relatively fertile ground for new conventions, <b>terminology</b>, procedure. For instance, listing of the \"jumped-from places\" (from what other points in the program could control have jumped to this point?) could be worth while. <br><br>c. A next level up in the <b>records</b> for a program's design is what usually is satisfied with a <b>flow</b> diagram. Len's recent memo (LJC 23 NOV 63) indicates a start toward a recording structure not dependent upon graphics. I should think that we can pursue this approach very usefully over the immediate <b>months</b> ahead. </div><div id='full_1'><mark>For instance: <br><br>(1) study <b>categorization</b> of <b>segments</b> (what is usually described in a process box), there may be more, useful labels than usually indicated by the graphical symbology in <b>flow</b> <b>charts</b>.</mark></div><div> Labels can easily be attached, in the text-character symbology we consider using, to fit many categories, sub-categories, etc. <br><br>(2) Not only categories of \"nodes\" of our processing neu.wrk, but the \"links\" as well might be categorized usefully. i.e. </div><div id='full_0'><mark>bes:ides categorizing and <b>labelling</b> the statements (what used to be in <b>flow</b>-chart boxes), we consider categorizing and <b>labelling</b> the types of links existing between different statements (or what used to be the lines between the <b>flow</b>-chart boxes).</mark></div><div> <br><br></div><div id='full_2'><mark>(3) Find a convenient way to hop between the segment-level description (what used to be portrayed in simple <b>flow</b> <b>charts</b>) ani the <b>instruction</b>-level description (the listings of <b>instruction</b>s).</mark></div><div> For example, perhaps the description of what a segment is supposed to do no longer is coupled as a co:mment that is :r:art of the listing, but now is removed to a linked position in the linked-segment graph (I guess I am searching for good names while I write. \"Flow chart\" doesn't quite seem appropriate. It really is a matter of a description of <b>segments</b> of programs and of their linkage. Linked-segment record?). You should be able to jump from a view of one form to a view of the other with relative ease. <br><br>(4) There are probably often good reasons for having higher-level <b>flow</b> <b>charts</b> in complex programs. I know that this is the case for complex equipments and their block diagrams. A set of conventions for establishing and portraying these different levels of process organization would be useful. Probably the set would be the same no natter at what level you would be working, once you had gotten above the first level or so. <br><br>(5) At any level, it should be easy to follow paths along the various <b>branches</b> and linkages. On-line procedures would. do well to harness light-pen selection of <b>branches</b> to follow. Off-line would require some indexing as to where in the hard copy would be found. the location to which this branch takes you next. Indexing in a common iniex is one possibility, but it would be more convenient to have, for instance, the page number associated with a given branching link listed right at the branch indication. <br><br></div><div id='full_3'><mark>(6) If primitive line-drawing technique becomes available in our display (or in the hard-copy output), we may find it very useful as one type of record to portray just the network topology for the linked-segment record a given level.</mark></div><div> Perhaps nodes would be labelled. by some brief code--point with light pen to get a description of that node displayed for you. The storage-tube display might come in handy for such a network display, since establishing vectors by dot generation can be done economically if they don't have to be regenerated continually. <br><br>(7) Changes in the record at one level usually imply changes at the other levels. Potential automatic accounting done--if you have made a change at one level, the other-level locations where change is potentially implied could be tagged appropriately, or a central file of updating changes (potential) could be kept. These <b>records</b> of potential changes to be made could link back to the explicit change which caused them to be established, so that when you began you cleanup work you would know where to begin. <br><br>(8) Provision for hanging <b>miscellaneous</b> comments onto the recorded structure should be made. By both the author am others. Along with this could go a central file of \"annunciators\" or flags that you (the author) could review occassiona.lly to see what comments, suggestions, warnings, etc., could have been left by others who may have been studying or using the <b>records</b> or the actual program. <br><br>(9) The off-line techniques being developed now for composing and modifying text could undoubtedly be expanded to include the composing and <b>modification</b> of these various types of process-structure design <b>records</b>. Same goes for the simple on-line review and editing possibilities with the 160-A-only system we are developing. Also, the techniques for off-line designation of changes to prior <b>records</b>, and for the extraction, <b>modification</b>, and integration into new hard-copy <b>records</b>. <br><br>5. I realize that the development of programs for all of these capabilities is beyond the scope of the next few <b>months</b> of activity, but the planning for coding, <b>terminology</b>, structuring conventions (format) etc., would want to be made with considerations of the future trends of our system, and I think that consideration of these future possibilities is important to us now. </div>",

Anticipated requirements for nerw concentration on the recording of our thoughts and actions and for learning and using new skills are pointed out as immediately visible changes in our working life. <br><br>TEXT: <br>1.0 Introduction <br>\t<br>\t1.1 The design of our AHI <b>research</b> program stipulates that: (a) our augementation developments be put to work in a real-life working environment, within a coordinated working system whose evolution is the essential concern. </div><div id='full_1'><mark>of our program, (b) the people who use these developments within this coordinated working system be the AHI <b>research</b>ers themselves, and.</mark></div><div> </div><div id='full_4'><mark>(c) the coordinated working system is that in which AHI <b>research</b> is done.</mark></div><div> <br>\t<br>\tl.2 It can be <b>anticipated</b> that we will soon have early developments sufficient for making the first significant changes in our working system. This presents us with the problems of examining our system planning for the coordination of the <b>anticipated</b> changes, and beginning to formulate the structure of the system's developing evolution. <br>\t<br>\tThe purpose of this memo is to raise some issues in this regard that both present my viewpoint and provide the basis for continued discussion. <br><br>2.0 The Recording of our Activity <br>The hope that computer aid can significantly increase the working effectiveness of real-wor1d problem solvers (like us) is based entirely upon the symbol-manipulation capability of the computer. The help we expect to get must involve symbols that have significance to our work. To derive full benefit from this help we shall find ourselves making new use of synibols and placing new depemence upon them--indeed, our <b>research</b> involves the development of just such in our way of working. The most significant symbols to us in our work are those that represent the thoughts and actions of ourselves and the people with whom we work. In our augmented systems, we are going to make much more effective use of the records of these thoughts and actions, and we are going to develop many new processes, methods and techniques both for establishing these records for making use of them. <br>\t<br>\t2.2 One practical <b>implication</b> of the above, to our program's working environment, is that we must tolerate the extra <b>labors</b> of establishing the records which our experimental working system is trying to make useful to us. We will want to make this as easy as possible by means of computer aids and system <b>procedures</b>, but there will always remain the fundamental, <b>unavoidable</b> effort of will and mind necessary to decide what to record, how to express it, how to organize it, how to label it, etc. (We will evolve <b>procedures</b>, language, am methods of work that help considerably in these decisions as well as in the labor of <b>transcribing</b> into recorded form.) <br><br>\tI see no way of avoiding the burden of establishing these records, and of living and complying with successive changes in <b>procedures</b>, nomenclature, format, etc., associated with our own exploratory and evolutionary working-system design. If sometimes we get restless because \"our work\"--as we have been used to viewing what our work is--seems to be impeded by the red tape of our working-system methods, we must remember that it is \"our work\" to use our experimental methods to do our work.<br><br>\t2.3 Another practical <b>implication</b>--we are soon going to find a lot more data being transcribed into both ham copy and computer-sensible form and we need to accommodate this in our working-system design. <br><br>\t2.3.1 Some of this data will be generated as we have mostly been doing it--a hard-copy draft handed to Judy for Flexing. Some work is more urgent than most, and we shall need priority <b>procedures</b> that evolve. We are undoubtedly going to have more work than one girl can handle, and we must plan for increased capacity: by increasing our inventory of tape-punching typewriters, by incorporation computer aids into the <b>transcription</b> system (cf. the see-also items), and by increasing our staff of <b>transcription</b> clerks. Our solution may be to have <b>transcription</b> <b>procedures</b> simple enough that transient contract typists can be brought in on call to accommodate peak loads.<br><br>\t2.5.2 A different kind of data well become involved in increasing volume--notes for POOC files that may be considerably less formal than for instance our QDOC items or the programming codes. It may prove worthwhile for each <b>research</b>er to have a dictating machine (portable, perhaps) into which he can enter working notes that, when transcribeda he can weed out, clean up, am organize quickly ani flexibly during his on-line working periods. <br><br>\tThe urgency for <b>transcription</b> of your PDOC entries will often be much like that associated with the coding sheets a programmer is working with during debug time--you will what it done right away s o that you can use it in the problem in which you are currently engrossed. <br> <br>\t</div><div id='full_2'><mark>2.3.3 We may well find that some portion of off-line work by AHI <b>research</b>ers could be done to considerable advantage directly on a tape-punch typewriter.</mark></div><div> With our new <b>transcription</b> codes most errors are easily corrected by a few strokes on the <b>keyboard</b>, and insert or delete in work can be specified rather directly. The short \"turn-around time\" thus obtained, for getting one's working data into the computer and being able to get back new-version hard copy or being able to work with the data on line, is likely to be very  valuable to one's working cycle. <br><br></div><div id='full_3'><mark>3.0 New-skill training for AHI <b>research</b>ers.</mark></div><div> <br></div><div id='full_0'><mark>Another practical <b>implication</b> from the foregoing discussion is that AHI <b>research</b>ers are continually going to be faced with learning new skills.</mark></div><div> Our <b>research</b> planning must accommodate this fact. It will be no seri ous evaluation of a new development if its test application is done by users who have not mastered the basic skills involved. <br><br>We will soon meet such a problem--<b>keyboard</b> skills. It seems <b>unavoidable</b> that every <b>research</b>er who is to be seriously involved in our experimental working system must require reasonable typing skill. I would say that \"reasonable\" means at least thirty words a minute (equal to a reasonable rapid handwriting rate), without watching the <b>keyboard</b>. Training to this level should be planned and begun soon, as explicit and necessary <b>research</b> activity and expense. <br><br>I would say that use of the binary keyset has yet to be established as a basic system skill. I currently feel rather definite about its not being a valid substitute for typewriter <b>keyboard</b> skill. Later developments in our equipment, coding, and <b>procedures</b> may well alter this attituie. <br><br>Besides the psycho-motor skills associated with <b>keyboard</b>s, light pens, etc., there will be conceptual and symbol skills basic to our working system. We must recognize the need to gain proficiency in these and plan for the necessary training. Procedures, terminology, and format we expect to have to learn in a new working system. But also we will face such a necessary skill as applying a set of category specifications. </div>",

Gribble (project monitor) for reference.<br><br>1c1c2 This documentation represents a first step in our experimentation with linked-<b>statement</b> software documentation, and as such deserves significant future attention by us relative to conventions, organization, and detail of content.<br><br>1c2 Off-line Text System (FLTS)<br><br>1c2a This system is an improved version of that described in our earlier User's Guide--giving a user (at a tape-punching typewriter) the ability to specify both intra<b>statement</b> editing commands and powerful structure-manipulation commands.<br><br>1c2b- This system wa programmed in FORTRAN to run on the 3100, and its first working version is in the final checkout stages.<br><br>1c2c The output of this system (paper tape) is compatible for input to NLTS.<br><br></div><div id='full_1'><mark>1c2d The paper-tape output from NLTS may be inputted to FLTS, along with a new paper-tape containing modification commands and new text, to effect extensive modification and updating to an NLTS file.</mark></div><div><br><br>1d Service System, Second Stage: We are currently engaged rather intensively in studying the needs and possibilities for a second-stage NLS (an on-line system capable of handling more than just text).<br><br>1d1 The primary features which we hope to achieve are:<br><br>1d1a Generalized-data packets<br><br>1d1a1 The entity which we have referred to as a \"<b>statement</b>\" in NLTS (which can include an arbitrary text string) needs generalization so that it can contain other kinds of data as well as (or instead of) text.<br><br>1d1a1a For instance, this feature permits us to embed representations of a graphic construct, or a vector representation of a function (as used in the Culler-Fried system).<br><br>1d1a2 We feel that there is much to gain by embedding these other types of data within the linked-<b>statement</b> structure--wherein a user may append any textual descriptions to, and provide flexible structuring and linkages among, his specialized packets of data.<br><br>1d1b Mixed language processes<br><br>1d1b1 For any of the programming and special processes with which we implement our experimental on-line user systems, we would like to be able to have a choice of the most appropriate language.<br><br>1d1b2 For speed and flexibility in implementing different system functions, we would like powerful high-level languages. The occasional importance to the user of rapid response is expected sometimes to dictate the efficient coding achievable with an assembly language.<br><br>1d1b3 We are currently favoring the combination of COPE and FORTRAN, with perhaps SNOBOL added later.<br><br>1d1c Flexible overlay system<br><br>1d1c1 The complete \"overlay\" generabi1ity afforded by some modern batch-processing operating systems is not expected to be appropriate for our needs. We want to have relatively close control of where an overlay is put and when it is loaded or flushed.<br><br>1d1d User macros: The user macros is an easy means for a user to compose new on-line commands<br><br>1d1d1 Ideally, he should be able to do this when he is working on line at the console.<br><br>1d1d2 This has long been on our \"needs\" list and is very important to flexibile experimentation. Good examples exist in the Culler-Fried system; in the OPS-3 system of Greenburger, et. al. (on the MIT MAC system); in the TRAC system of Mooers and Deutsch; and in the recent developments by Ellis and Sibley (RAND Corporation) and Bert Sutherland (Lincoln Laboratories).<br><br>1d2 At least two other projects are planning to build upon this basic second-stage NLS, and the work of specification and implementation would be shared among us.<br><br></div><div id='full_0'><mark>1e Visitors: Demonstrations and explanations were given to the following visitors during this first quarter:<br><br>1e1 Kenneth Thompson and Ralph Love, University of California, Berkeley<br><br>1e2 Mr. Rinia, Phillips, Eindhoven<br><br>1e3 Dr. Fred C.

BERMAN<br><br>Abstract: Tests and analysis to determine the best display <b>selection</b> techniques for a computer-aided text-manipulation system reveal that the choice does not hinge on the inherent differences in <b>target</b>-<b>selection</b> speed and accuracy between the different <b>selection</b> <b>devices</b>. Of more importance are such factors as the mix of other operations required of the select-operation hand, the ease of getting the hand to and gaining control of a given <b>selection</b> device, or the fatique effects of its associated operating posture. Besides a light <b>pen</b>, several cursor-controlling <b>devices</b> were tested, including a <b>joystick</b> and an SRI-developed device known as a \"mouse.\" The study was aimed directly at finding the best display <b>selection</b> means for our own text-manipulation system but generalizations applicable to other types of on-line systems were derived.<br><br>1. INTRODUCTION<br><br>This paper describes an experimental study into the relative merits of different CRT display-<b>selection</b> <b>devices</b> as used within a real-time, computer-display, text-manipulation system in use at Stanford Research Institute.<br><br>Briefly, we have developed a comprehensive on line text-manipulation system. We wanted to determine the best means by which a user can designate textual entities to be used as \"<b>operands</b>\" in the different text-manipulation operations.<br><br>Techniques and <b>devices</b> for display-entity operand selcction represent a major component in any display control scheme, and are readily isolated for purposes of comparative testing, once the procedural environment in which <b>selection</b> is done has been established.<br><br>An important conclusion of our experimentation is that this environment has considerable effect upon the choice of display-<b>selection</b> means for a given display-control system.<br><br>Our text-manipulation system is designed for daily usage, and our experiments and conclusions stem from extensive personal experience as users as well as designers.<br><br>To emphasize this, we point out that for two years we have been using the system for producing most of the internal memos -- and all of the proposals and reports -- associated with our research program.<br><br>This paper itself was extracted from one of these reports -- reorganized and modified by use of the system. See 1 (ENGLISH 1).<br><br>The format and writing style which represent an important experimental component of our research, are left in the form with which we work.<br><br>Statements -- be they subheads, phrases, sentences, or paragraphs -- are numbered and presented in hierarchical order. These statement numbers are one \"handle\" by which a statement may be grasped for any of the operations performed on- or off-line.<br><br>References, which appear in the Bibliography at the end of the paper, are shown in the text by a mention of their statement numbers \"see 1 (ENGLISH 1)\", rather than by the more familiar superscript notation.<br><br>The tests of the display-<b>selection</b> <b>devices</b> simulated the general situation faced by a user of our on-line system when he must interpose a screen-<b>selection</b> operation into his on-going working operations. See Fig. 1 for a layout of the on-line work station. <br><br>Fig. 1. The on-line system workstation showing the CRT display, keyboard, pushbuttons, and mouse.<br><br>The user has generally been entering information on the typewriter-like keyboard.<br><br>To begin making the screen <b>selection</b>, his righl hand leaves the keyboard and takes hold of (\"accesses,\" in our terminology) the <b>selection</b> device.<br><br>By moving this device he controls the position on the screen of an associated tracking mark (or \"<b>bug</b>\"), placing it over the \"<b>target</b>\" text entity.<br><br>He then actuates a pushbutton associated with the particular <b>selection</b> device, to tell the computer that he is now \"pointing at\" the <b>target</b> entity.<br><br>The computer puts a special mark under the entity which it determines as having been selected, to give the user an opportunity to see if a correct <b>selection</b> has been made.<br><br>We designed and conducted our experiments in order to learn more about the following characteristics of the operand-selecting <b>devices</b> currently available in our on line system:<br><br>The comparative speed with which they could be used to select material on the display screen. Two kinds of time period were measured:<br><br>\"Access time\": the time it takes for the user to move his hand from the keyboard to the operand selecting device.<br><br>\"Motion time\": the time period beginning with the first movement of the <b>bug</b> and ending with the \"select\" action fixing the <b>bug</b> at some particular character position.<br><br>The comparative ease with which an untrained user could become reasonably proficient in using the various <b>devices</b>.<br><br>The comparative <b>error</b> rates of the various <b>devices</b>.<br><br>2. DESCRIPTION OF THE DEVICES TESTED<br><br>The tests included both a light <b>pen</b> and various <b>devices</b> to position a cursor (or \"<b>bug</b>\" as we call it) on the CRT screen.<br><br>Operand entities displayed on the screen are chosen by selecting a character within the operand entity (word, line, or statement).<br><br>The light <b>pen</b> or <b>bug</b> is first located near the desired character, then the SELECT switch on the device is depressed (or in the case of the <b>knee</b> control a special \"CA\" key on the keyboard is struck).<br><br>Grafacon (see Fig. </div><div id='full_3'><mark>2): <br><br>Fig.2 Bug-positioning <b>devices</b> from left to right: <b>joystick</b>, Grafacon, and mouse<br><br>The Grafacon was manufactured by Data Equipment Company as a graphical input device for <b>curve</b> tracing.</mark></div><div> See 2 (FLETCHER 1). The particular device that we tested is no longer marketed under this name.

DESCRIPTION OF THE EXPERIMENTS<br><br>The experiments were designed to test the various operand-Selecting <b>devices</b> under conditions similar to those that the user would encounter when actually working<br><br>However, certain features of the live working conditions were not closely related to the actual efficiency of the operand-selecting <b>devices</b>, such as<br><br>The need to enter literal input from the keyboard,<br><br>The need to designate commands, and<br><br>The user's indecision in choosing which display elltity to select.<br><br>We tried either to eliminate these features from the experimental environment, or to fix them in some standard way through the experiment<br><br>Two different kinds of display-entity \"<b>target</b>s\" were presented in the experiments: \"word\" <b>target</b>s and \"character\" <b>target</b>s. The <b>target</b> patterns presented to the <b>subject</b> were configurations of x's rather than actual text. <br><br></div><div id='full_1'><mark>Fig 6: Targets used to experimentally evaluate the operand-locating <b>devices</b> and results of an <b>incorrect</b> <b>selection</b>  <br>a) \"Character mode\" operation showing the <b>target</b> (Middle X) and <b>bug</b> (plus sign)  <br>b) \"Word Mode\" operation.</mark></div><div> The <b>target</b> is the middle five X's  <br>c) An <b>incorrect</b> <b>selection</b> is underlined.

The <b>target</b> entity was any one of the five middle x's [i.e., any character in the middle \" word\"; see Fig. 6(b)].<br><br>The <b>subject</b> was given a series of tests with each of these two types of <b>target</b>s, and was to perform the following task sequence:<br><br>When the <b>target</b> appeared on the display screen, the <b>subject</b> was to strike the keyboard space-<b>bar</b> with his right hand, causing the <b>bug</b> to appear on the display. (Requiring that he use his right hand for both the space <b>bar</b> and the operand-selecting device made the experimental task closer to the actual on-line environment, where the user would often have both hands at the keyboard before moving to the operand selecting device. It also gave us a way of measuring the access times for the various <b>devices</b>.)<br><br>The <b>subject</b> was then to move his hand to the <b>bug</b>-positioning device being tested, and use it to guide the <b>bug</b> to the <b>target</b> entity on the display.<br><br></div><div id='full_4'><mark>When the <b>bug</b> and the <b>target</b> coincided the <b>subject</b> was to \"fix\" the <b>bug</b> at that location, using the select switch of the <b>bug</b>-positioning device.</mark></div><div><br><br>An <b>incorrect</b> <b>selection</b> was signalled by a bell, and the <b>incorrect</b>ly selected entity was underlined in the displayed <b>target</b> pattern [see Fig. 6(c)]; the <b>subject</b> was then to relocate the <b>bug</b> and reselect the <b>target</b> entity.<br><br>A correct <b>selection</b> caused the <b>target</b> to dis appear, and the word \"CORRECT\" to appear on the display screen [see Fig. 6(d)]. About three seconds later, the next <b>target</b> pattern was displayed (in some new randomly-determined position), and the process was repeated.<br><br></div><div id='full_2'><mark>When the light <b>pen</b> rather than a <b>bug</b>-positioning device was used, the task sequence was much the same: after the <b>target</b> appeared, the <b>subject</b> was to strike the keyboard space <b>bar</b> with his right hand, then grasp the light <b>pen</b> and point it at the <b>target</b> entity (with the aid of the finder beam).</mark></div><div> The <b>subject</b> \"fixed\" his choice by depressing the select switch on the light <b>pen</b>. Correct and <b>incorrect</b> <b>selection</b>s were signaled in the same way as with the <b>bug</b>-positioning <b>devices</b>.<br><br>There were two groups of <b>subject</b>s: eight \"experienced\" <b>subject</b>s who were already somewhat familiar with the on-line system, and three \"<b>inexperienced</b>\" <b>subject</b>s who had never before used either the system or the particular <b>devices</b> being tested. The experienced group were given experiments to test the <b>devices</b> after a reasonable amount of practice. The <b>inexperienced</b> group were tested to see how quickly and how well they learned to use the <b>devices</b> without previous practice.<br><br>For the experienced <b>subject</b>s, the entire testing procedure, which was broken into two time periods proceeded as follows:<br><br>The <b>subject</b> was given a brief explanation of the experiment and the <b>target</b> patterns.<br><br>He was then given his first device and allowed to practice with it for about two minutes.<br><br>Next he was tested using this first device, in both the \"word\" mode and the \"character\" mode of <b>selection</b>. Thirty-two <b>target</b>s of each type were presented. 3d1d After a two-minute rest period, the <b>subject</b> was given his second device and allowed to practice with it for about two minutes. He was then tested with this device -- again, with 32 <b>target</b>s of each type.<br><br>This same sequence of rest, practice, and testing was carried out for each of the <b>devices</b> being tested. This constituted the first time period of the experiment.<br><br>During the second time period, the <b>subject</b> proceeded backward through the list of <b>devices</b>, begining with the last device he had used in the previous time period, then using the next-to-last device, and so on.<br><br>Each <b>subject</b> began with a different device and was presented with <b>devices</b> in a different order.<br><br>For <b>inexperienced</b> <b>subject</b>s, the experimental procedure was somewhat different:<br><br>The <b>subject</b> was given an explanation of the experiment, the <b>target</b> patterns, and the way the particular operand-selecting device worked. He was allowed to get the feel of the device, but was not given a practice period. He was then presented with ten sequences of eight <b>target</b>-patterns each, in the \"character\" mode.<br><br>This procedure was followed for each of the <b>devices</b> being tested.<br><br>Each <b>subject</b> began with a different device, and was given a different order of <b>devices</b> to work with.<br><br>The computer was used extensively in conducting these experiments: for presenting <b>target</b> patterns, signalling of correct and <b>incorrect</b> <b>selection</b>s, determining the (random) position of the next <b>target</b> pattern, determining the short time-delays between a correct <b>selection</b> and the presentation of the next <b>target</b>, etc. In addition, for each presentation-<b>selection</b> event, the computer recorded the following information on magnetic tape for later analysis:<br><br>The position of the <b>bug</b> (in relation to the <b>target</b> entity) was recorded each 10 mulliseconds.<br><br>The times the <b>subject</b> hit the space <b>bar</b>, and the times he made either a correct or an <b>incorrect</b> entity <b>selection</b>, were recorded and appropriately tagged to aid in identifying these significant points in the late data analysis.<br><br>The length of the experimental runs; the rest periods allowed between runs; the order in which the various de vices were tested; and the modes of operation (\"character\" or \"word\" <b>target</b>s) were controlled by the person con ducting the experiments.<br><br>4. DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA ANALYSIS<br><br>The analysis software was designed to allow flexibility in studying individual performance <b>curve</b>s and results. This software provided operator commands for scanning the recorded data on the magnetic tape, selectively printing out results, producing CRT-displayed <b>curve</b>s of each <b>subject</b>'s performance, and calculating certain averages over a block of tests.<br><br>Tape-handling operations, controlled by commands from the on-line keyboard, facilitate searching through the data recorded on the magnetic tapes. These commands allowed one to scan forward or backward by one 32-<b>target</b> block of tests (or, an 8-<b>target</b> block, in the records for <b>inexperienced</b> <b>subject</b>s); and, within that block, to scan forward or backward one <b>target</b> (i.e. one presentation-<b>selection</b> event) at a time.<br><br>For each <b>target</b>-fix, the CRT could display a graph showing the <b>bug</b>'s distance from its <b>target</b> entity as a function of time. This was displayed as two <b>curve</b>s (see Fig. 7), one showing variation with time of horizontal distance, and the other of vertical distance. The time-count was begun when the <b>target</b> appeared on the display. Vertical lines on the <b>curve</b>s mark the time at which the space <b>bar</b> was struck and the time at which the <b>target</b> was correctly selected. Incorrect <b>selection</b>s are shown as x's on the <b>curve</b>. <br>  <br>Fig. 7. Analysis <b>curve</b>s of the experiments<br><br>Figure 7 presents two examples of these <b>curve</b>s. Figure 7(a) shows a typical performance <b>curve</b> for the Grafacon; Fig. 7(b) shows an example of <b>joystick</b> performance in which the <b>subject</b> made several <b>error</b>s before selecting the correct <b>target</b> entity.<br><br>When viewed on-line on the CRT display, the scale of these <b>curve</b>s can be changed by keyboard entered commands that inde<b>pen</b>dently change either the distance or the time scale. This time scale change feature was included because of the radical variations in the times, among various <b>devices</b> and various <b>subject</b>s. The distance scale change allows detailed examination of performance when the <b>bug</b> is near the <b>target</b>.<br><br>When studying a given <b>target</b>-fix event, the experimenter can, if he wishes, initiate output (to the on-line typewriter) of performance data: the time at which the space <b>bar</b> was struck, the time at which the <b>bug</b> movement began, the time at which the <b>target</b> was correctly selected, and the number of <b>error</b>s (<b>incorrect</b> <b>selection</b>s) made. </div><div id='full_0'><mark>This software also computed and printed out the following incre mental times: the access time (from the time the space <b>bar</b> was struck until the time the <b>bug</b> movement began, measuring how long it took the <b>subject</b> to move his hand from the keyboard to the device); the <b>motion</b> time (from the time the <b>bug</b> began moving until the time the <b>target</b> was correctly selected); and total time (from the time the space <b>bar</b> was struck until the time the <b>target</b> was correctly selected -- i.e., the sum of access time plus <b>motion</b> time).</mark></div><div><br><br>Finally, there is another command which causes the computer to search through a 32-<b>target</b> block of <b>target</b> fixes and compute (for output to the on-line typewriter) the average incremental times, and total number of <b>error</b>s, for that block.<br><br>The CRT <b>curve</b>s of distance-vs.-time could be scanned with the on-line system, in order to determine where the <b>subject</b>s s<b>pen</b>t most of their time; how much time they s<b>pen</b>t in actually selecting the <b>target</b> entity after the <b>bug</b> was already positioned correctly; whether the <b>error</b>s seemed more predominant in one direction than in another (horizontally or vertically); and other such detailed information relating to individual per formances.<br><br>The numerical averages computed with the help of the rest of the analysis software were collected and summarized as experimental results, presented in the following description.<br><br>5. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS<br><br>Summary data: Figs. 8 through 10 contain the <b>bar</b> charts comparing the various operand-selecting <b>devices</b> with respect to the time required for a correct <b>selection</b>. <br>  <br>Fig. 8. Comparison of the operand-locating <b>devices</b> for \"experienced\" <b>subject</b>s, \"Character Mode\" operations  <br>Fig. 9.

Comparison of the operand-locating <b>devices</b> for \"<b>inexperienced</b>\" <b>subject</b>s, \"Character Mode\" operation<br><br>Figures 8 and 9 are taken from the results of the eight experienced <b>subject</b>s, some of whom were very familiar with the on-line system and had used the <b>devices</b> often. Figure 8(a) shows the average total time (for all experienced <b>subject</b>s) required for a correct <b>selection</b> of the \"character\" <b>target</b>, with no <b>pen</b>alty for <b>error</b>s; Figure 8(b) shows the results of the same tests with a 30 percent <b>pen</b>alty for <b>error</b>s. Figure 9(a) and 9(b), respectively, show the same for the \"word\" <b>target</b>.<br><br>The 30 percent <b>error</b> <b>pen</b>alty is an approximate figure arrived at by the following argument: if a user wished to correct an <b>incorrect</b>ly selected operand, he would need to strike the \"Command Delete\" key with his other hand before re-attempting a correct operand <b>selection</b>. This would take about as long as the time required to strike the space <b>bar</b> when the <b>target</b> first appeared. From the experiments we found that the time required to strike the space <b>bar</b> accounted for about 30 of the total time. Thus we computed the time for the <b>error</b>-<b>pen</b>alty graphs by multiplying the <b>subject</b>'s <b>error</b> rate on that device by 30 percent of his average time, and adding that figure to the total time.<br><br>Figure 10 shows the results from the tests of <b>subject</b>s who had had no previous experience with the <b>devices</b>. Figure 10(a) imposes no <b>pen</b>alty for <b>error</b>s. Figure 10(b) imposes a 30 percent <b>pen</b>alty for <b>error</b>s, as explained above. <br><br>Fig. 11. Error rates for \"experienced\" sujects  <br>Fig. 12. Error rates for \"<b>inexperienced</b>\" sujects, \"Character Mode\" operations<br><br>Figures 11 and 12 compare the <b>error</b> rates for the various <b>devices</b>. Figure 11 shows the results for the \"character\" and \"word\" tests, as performed by experienced <b>subject</b>s (using four different operand locating <b>devices</b>); Figure 12(a) shows the results of the \"character\" tests for <b>inexperienced</b> <b>subject</b>s (using six different operand-locating <b>devices</b>).<br><br>These results indicate that for the more experienced <b>subject</b>s the mouse was both faster and more accurate than any other device -- including the light <b>pen</b>. Inexperienced <b>subject</b>s, however, tended to perform better with both the light <b>pen</b> and the <b>knee</b> control than with the mouse.<br><br>As mentioned above, the <b>knee</b> control was not developed soon enough to include it in the tests for the experienced <b>subject</b>s (where we included only <b>devices</b> that had been available for some time, in order to avoid bias). We did, however, perform a few individual check tests with experienced <b>subject</b>s, using the <b>knee</b> control; in these tests the <b>knee</b> control appeared both slower and less accurate than the light <b>pen</b> and mouse.<br><br>Inexperienced <b>subject</b>s found the <b>knee</b> control was the fastest device. Undoubtedly the main reason for this was that the <b>knee</b> control, unlike all the others, has no access time. (If the access time is subtracted from the total times measured for the other <b>devices</b>, the <b>knee</b> control no longer show up so favorably.)<br><br>Inexperienced subiects also found the light <b>pen</b> faster than the mouse. A reason for this may be that the light <b>pen</b> exploits one's inherent tendency to select something by straightforwardly \"pointing\" at it rather than by guiding a <b>bug</b> across a screen toward it from a remote control. This means that an <b>inexperienced</b> <b>subject</b> can become reasonably proficient in using a light <b>pen</b> with relatively little practice.<br><br>The <b>joystick</b> proved to be both the slowest and the least accurate of the <b>devices</b> we tested, in both modes of its operation (\"absolute\" and \"rate\"), and among both the experienced and <b>inexperienced</b> <b>subject</b>s.<br><br>It is interesting to note, however, that both the <b>joystick</b> and the Grafacon showed up more favorably (relative to the other <b>devices</b>) when used to select word entities rather than character entities. These two <b>devices</b> seem to perform better where fine control is less critical; they can move into range quickly at the grosser level.<br><br>There were some obvious defects in the particular <b>devices</b> tested. For this reason, and because of the very limited nature of the tests, we should be careful not to apply these results to the class of device used, but only to the particular examples that were tested.<br><br>Both the Grafacon and <b>joystick</b> suffer from a lack of inde<b>pen</b>dence in the actions required to actuate the select switch and to move the <b>bug</b>. By contrast, the mouse is moved by an action of the entire hand, while the switch is easily operated by one finger and does not tend to cause <b>bug</b> <b>motion</b>.<br><br>With the <b>joystick</b> the scale factor between <b>bug</b> <b>motion</b> and device <b>motion</b> was about 4:1 for a normal finger position on the stick; for the mouse and Grafacon, the scale was about 2:1. This may have contributed to the lack of fine control (and high <b>error</b> rate) for the <b>joystick</b>.<br><br>The rate mode with the <b>joystick</b> is very poor, partly because of the software implementation.<br><br>We used a nonlinear relationship between deflection and rate of <b>bug</b> <b>motion</b> (approximating a square law), and left too much dead space around the center position of the stick. This made large <b>bug</b> <b>motion</b>s very easy, but too much stick <b>motion</b> was involved in changing directions.<br><br>In the experiments one reason for the very high <b>error</b> rate in this mode is that the <b>subject</b>s tried to \"catch\" the <b>target</b> on the way past, to avoid changing direction.<br><br>The light <b>pen</b> may have showed up poorly for several reasons.<br><br>The mounting was somewhat clumsy and the <b>subject</b> had to reposition the <b>pen</b> on this mounting after each <b>target</b> <b>selection</b>, returning to the keyboard in time for the next <b>target</b> presentation. This tended to cause hurried <b>motion</b>s, and may have resulted in many of the <b>incorrect</b> <b>selection</b>s made.<br><br>A second reason for the higher <b>error</b> rate is that for some tests the intensity-of the displayed <b>target</b>s was too high, making it easy for the <b>pen</b> to pick up light from an adjoining character. This difficulty could be overcome, and the overall per formance of the light <b>pen</b> improved, if computer feedback were provided, to indicate to the <b>subject</b> which character the <b>pen</b> was actually detecting.<br><br>We initially expected to find that the starting distance between the <b>bug</b> and its <b>target</b> entity on the face of the display would significantly affect the <b>motion</b> time required for selecting the <b>target</b>.<br><br>However, the results compiled and plotted to test this hypothesis did not show any significant correlation.<br><br>An examination of the CRT-displayed perform ance <b>curve</b>s suggests that this may be because the time to move the <b>bug</b> close to the <b>target</b> is relatively small compared to the average access time, and to the average time required for selecting the <b>target</b> after the <b>bug</b> has been moved close to it.<br><br>Examination of the CRT-displayed <b>curve</b>s (distance from <b>target</b> as a function of time) allows several other observations as well:<br><br>In using the Grafacon and the <b>joystick</b> (rate mode), the <b>subject</b>s tended to overshoot the <b>target</b>, losing a significant amount of time in changing the <b>bug</b>'s direction and bringing it back into position for a select action.<br><br>While our experiments did not provide a measure of access time for the light <b>pen</b>, we found (from observing the <b>subject</b>s) that a good deal of time was consumed in reaching from the keyboard to grasp the light <b>pen</b>.<br><br>Though the <b>knee</b> control showed up well in its performance as compared with the other <b>devices</b>, an examination of its CRT-displayed <b>curve</b>s shows that its operation is relatively unsmooth; the <b>bug</b> tends to move erratically, and it appears to be difficult to move the <b>bug</b> vertically on the display.<br><br>Our other source of \"data\" -- gained by asking the <b>subject</b>s how they liked the various <b>devices</b> -- reveals that the light <b>pen</b>, while operating in a natural way, does tend to be fatiguing; and that the mouse -- though it requires some practice -- seems to be a satisfying device to use (accurate, and non-fatiguing).<br><br>6. CONCLUSIONS<br><br>Some specific conclusions about the relative merits of the <b>devices</b>.<br><br>The operand-selecting <b>devices</b> that showed up well in our tests were the mouse; the <b>knee</b> control; and the light <b>pen</b>. These three were generally both faster and more accurate than the other <b>devices</b> tested.<br><br>Inexperienced <b>subject</b>s did not perform quite as well with the mouse as with the light <b>pen</b> and <b>knee</b> control, but experienced <b>subject</b>s found the mouse the \"best\" of the <b>devices</b> tested, and both groups of <b>subject</b>s found that it was satisfying to use and caused little fatigue.<br><br>The select switches on both the Grafacon and <b>joystick</b> tended to move the <b>bug</b> and cause an <b>incorrect</b> fix. These two <b>devices</b> could probably be improved by redesigning their select switch mechanisms.<br><br>Although the <b>knee</b> control was only primitively developed at the time it was tested, it ranked high in both speed and accuracy, and seems very promising. It offers the major advantage that it leaves both hands free to work at the keyboard.<br><br>The major advantage of the light <b>pen</b> appeared to be its psychological \"naturalness\" of operation in pointing at the item to be selected. This means that an untrained user can quickly understand it and gain enough proficiency to do useful work.<br><br>Weighed against this, however, is the disadvantage that the <b>pen</b> must be held in the air while it is being used. Many <b>subject</b>s expressed feelings of fatigue while using it for a prolonged time. To some extent, this disadvantage might be alleviated by a carefully designed mounting for the <b>pen</b>.<br><br>Observations about the experiments.<br><br>The principal value of our experimental work to date was in developing the techniques of experiment and analysis, and in isolating some of the factors in the design of display-<b>selection</b> means that are important to fast operation. 6b2 Any comparative evaluation of the different types of <b>devices</b> must be qualified to such an extent that it is not significantly useful in a direct sense toward choosing from among the types of <b>devices</b>.<br><br>What is important to fast, efficient display <b>selection</b> is the particular feel to the user of the thing he grasps and moves, e.g.:<br><br>Where he reaches to grasp it;<br><br>How it fits his grasp;<br><br>How the scale of horizontal displacement is related to <b>bug</b> <b>motion</b> on the screen;<br><br>How he actuates the select switch;<br><br>How much mass he moves;<br><br>How the large-<b>motion</b> capability of arm and wrist can coordinate with fine-<b>motion</b> capability of the fingers;<br><br>How he can rest his arm, hand, and wrist (or how much weight he has to support);<br><br>And whether, when he removes his hand, the thing stays put, returns to a standard position, drifts away (as our modified form of the Grafacon did), falls down on the table, or has to be put down or hung on something.<br><br>To make final judgments between display-<b>selection</b> <b>devices</b>, more must be learned about the desirable way to adjust and coordinate each of these factors. Then it must be seen which basic-device approach can best provide this.<br><br>Comparative comments of a general sort can follow these observations:<br><br>For the light <b>pen</b>, there is enough less freedom to vary the above-listed design factors (than there is for the other <b>devices</b>) that its probability of being the best candidate diminishes appreciably.<br><br>Any final, significant differences between best designs for joy stick, Grafacon, and mouse are not descernible now.<br><br>The fact that a no-hands <b>bug</b>-control device can allow both hands to remain on the keyboard is an important factor in its consideration. Even if its <b>selection</b> speed and resolution could not be developed to match that of a good hand-controlled device, what we are learning about the importance of smooth coordination between the different prim itive operations would make it a strong candidate.<br><br>An important, general conclusion from our tests is that the relative value of different schemes cannot be judged on the basis of their appeal to <b>inexperienced</b> users.<br><br>The net conclusions drawn from our work to date seem disappointingly nonspecific -- but therein lies one of the most important lessons we have learned.<br><br>This \"lesson\" can be expressed as follows:<br><br>Display-control research is important because it provides basic processes whose speed and fiexibility promise to affect strongly the speed and flexibility that can be developed for higher-level processes. And it is this latter speed and flexibility, for a human to execute tasks at a meaningful intellectual level, which is the goal of research in on-line working systems.<br><br>Thus, the display-control processes whose design is our direct concern are really important only in the way in which they serve as components in larger processes.<br><br>The value of our design effort then must be measured in the improvement it thus provides in higher-level performance.<br><br>To pursue this kind of development and evaluation work, it is necessary to consider the interaction of higher-level considerations with those of direct involvement with the low-level processes where concern is likely to focus.<br><br>Thus, it seems unrealistic to expect a flat statement that one device is better than another. The details of the usage system in which the device is to be embedded make too much difference.<br><br>Irrespective of the speeds with which one can make successive display <b>selection</b>s with a given device, the tradeoffs for the characteristics of fatigue, quick transfer to and from a keyboard, etc., will heavily weight the choice among the <b>devices</b>. And these tradeoffs, and the possibilities for designing around them, are not apparent until after a good deal of design and analysis has been done for the rest of the system.</div>",

onclick='player.seekTo(1867.21)'>We have a plain device called a mouse, standard keyboard and a special key set we have here, and we're going to go for a picture down in our laboratory and then we'll

onclick='player.seekTo(1887.98)'>Okay, there is Don Andrew's hand in Menlo Park and in a second, we'll see the screen that he's working and the way the tracking <b>spot</b> moves in conjunction with

started that way and we never did change it. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(1906.5)'>Alright, as it moves up or down or sideways, so does the tracking <b>spot</b> and the...the principles for this operation is quite easy to see if you'll turn it over, Don. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(1918.5)'>Can you hear me Don, would you turn it over and we'll see you, right. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(1921.44)'>Its principle is that, there're two wheels that roll on the surface. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(1925.5)'>It's inside right angles and kind of sharp edges, one'll roll and the other slide in one direction. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(1931.29)'>Each of it...each of these wheels controls through potentiometer, with a voltage output sampled by an ADD converter. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(1940.05)'>The numbers taken in by the computer at sample times as to what the horizontal vertical...complements are to be, of where it should put the tracking <b>spot</b> and as the mouse moves over a surface, then you see those wheels either slide sideways without rolling or rolls in a motion that very closely duplicates the particular component of horizontal or vertical and the net motion it makes. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(1968.92)'>Alright, if you take a mouse and move it through some closed trajectory back to exactly the same point, usually the tracking <b>spot</b> won't come back to exactly the same place it was on the screen, and for that sense it wouldn't work well if you're trying to trace maps or other figures and diagrams. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(1986.16)'>But the way we use it continuously and exclusively as to watch the screen and to follow it around, and we use this merely as a device to move that tracking <b>spot</b> and you're in the tracking <b>spot</b>, you really don't care whether it follows exactly this or not. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2001.31)'>In fact, we've had it at times where our tracking device, you had to move in an arc like that to make the <b>spot</b>, the tracking

onclick='player.seekTo(2018.31)'>Other features in the mouse are that it stays put. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2021.24)'>I can lift it and replace it without having the <b>spot</b> changed, so I can adjust where I want it for my comfort, and these control buttons on the top are used by that mouse. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2032.7)'>Show you a little bit later how some of those were used. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2034.87)'>Now the keyboard in the middle is essentially a standard typewriter keyboard except for a few special keys out inside. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2040.99)'>The computer knows it instantly when you get one and makes an appropriate response. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2045.4)'>This device over here is unique to us and we always have to justify and explain it. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2051.79)'>We'll do it in reverse order. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2052.96)'>We'll explain it first. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2055.49)'>It provides for you the one hand equivalent of what you can do with a keyboard. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2062.22)'>The five keys are normally each finger sits on a key and depressing any one key at a time produces a character. </span><br><br><span

</span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2126.32)'>Let me restore, a view like this to show you. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2130.6)'>This is more normally the way we work with feedback up here, or here I'm shown; not working. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2138.09)'>That's an echo register that normally gives you the last six characters that you used. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2147.22)'>Oops...not working alright, the last six characters and left shifts continuously so you can look up anytime and see what have I just struck, and that's very good feedback. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2157.73)'>Here, the characters show me the different viewing <b>parameters</b>, few specks. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2162.85)'>They get large at times at which I can add, hit single strokes...\r\nThat change those view <b>parameters</b>. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2176.55)'>And each of those means something to me, and their being large at particular times tells me I can hit very quick abbreviation for changing the view. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2185.57)'>So I can say, I'd like to go to produce but I'd like...\r\n\r\nGo to produce, they get big, I'd like to say, one branch only and let me look just that low and I see it. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2198.78)'>Oh, I can say, I'd like to see one line only. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2203.78)'>I can see it. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2204.74)'>So these ways I move around, the way I get feedback up here, the way I use both hands to coordinate to tell the computer what command and what sort of letters I want up, are all carefully designed to go together to make the repertoire. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2229.28)'>We talk about the devices and now the nature of the dialogue with a kind of feedback we get from the computer for each of the discreet character strokes and actions that the user goes through when he's making, when he's executing a command. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2243.23)'>So that system is really represented to a user by the repertoire of commands he has, by the function of each of those commands and by the controlled dialogue he has for each of them. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2257.89)'>So they all together go in making a design and to do it well, you have to be very careful about the nature of the functions on that repertoire and the nature of the way they're controlled. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2269.19)'>So we've developed a very special language for talking with extreme precision about these controls, both the command functions and the control dialogue for them, and little bit later when we tell you about the programming, Jeff Wilson will bring in some special examples to you of the languages we've used, actually the program at high level, these functions and the control feedback that we get and these control dialogues. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2298.51)'>But that's why we're going to call the control mother language in there. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2302.28)'>Let's see how we're doing here. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2305.94)'>Okay, let's move our little <b>marker</b> to say we've now gotten control techniques by us, and let's talk about implementation of our online

stations. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2531.06)'>Let me talk to you about the display systems, the other aspect of the things that we've built on in here that are slightly unusual. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2542.69)'>For that, I'd like to switch to Menlo Park, and get a view from the camera there and actually looking at the hardware. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2550.87)'>So these are the units, it developed the displays, the computer constructs it right on a small high resolution CRT which you're focusing on right now, and in fact that's the CRT whose camera on the right looking at it, is generating the text view that's being typed down here on my console. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2570.43)'>So as those are

up the camera shot little bit, we'll see that we have a whole rack full of equipment here serving 12 of them, but you'll notice quite a lack of cameras mounted on. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2609.4)'>We seem to have stolen them all for this show. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2613.6)'>So we're going to have several consoles at work right now because the cameras are mounted to give you these different special views. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2621.16)'>I thought quite a few advantages; we use this particular display system, hard work technique, pretty much as expediency for an experimental system we had to build. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2633.53)'>We originally were going to build storage to displays under here but we couldn't get them delivered a year and a half ago when we really had to firm up our design so we, as expediency wanted this. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2645.69)'>Ran has been developing some very nice video stuff. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2648.96)'>They were kind enough to show us how these, these controllers now would work with videos. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2654.07)'>So we went ahead with this very simple brute force way of having the video signal generated by looking at a small CRT. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2661.4)'>Well, it turns out that that little CRT, its incremental cost, the video camera, the controller and a marcher total about $5500 which is cheaper than most fairly good

it's actually, it doesn't erase the image on it by each sweep, it may take three or four scans and so it's something like a 15 cycle per second refresh rate on those CRTs, the camera, the one that's

</span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(2939.38)'>This <b>file</b> is written in a, one of these many special languages that we've designed, so I've just moved down through it find the move

through that one. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3006.09)'>The, the text that is overlaid illustrates a lot of the different kinds of things that we've done. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3012.47)'>This <b>file</b> has two major kinds of code in it. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3015.67)'>First one is, many of these different special languages that we built up, see I'm trying to find QMW, that's right. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3025.97)'>So, down here some place. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3031.06)'>There we go. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3037.32)'>See, two kinds of code. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3039.6)'>This is still the kind from the other <b>file</b> but the QMW routine, the first sub-routine, the second sub-routine that it calls which is sort of interesting is move word, the word ____ I'm sorry, this routine is written in, in our Console Analysis language and it takes the text string and finds the definition of a word, what's after punctuation and it finds any special blanks around it. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3066.08)'>It finds pointers that describe that word. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3069.1)'>Another interesting one is the next sub-routine here. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3073.12)'>If we look at it, it's in another special language that we built up. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3077.95)'>It takes the pointers left over from the limited routine and the text and the <b>file</b> and reconstructs the <b>statement</b> after the edit's been done. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3088.19)'>Let's see, where was I in this <b>file</b>? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3096.12)'>The other portion of the <b>file</b> is, is written in a language that we call MOL, and that stands for Machine Oriented Language. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3106.16)'>The, the MOL is a...in essence, it's a high level language in that it has great structure and good control constructs like IF <b>statement</b>s and WHILE <b>statement</b>s, but it's also very, very close to machine language, 940 machine language. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3123.14)'>People talk about the actual registers of the machine and you talk about doing indirect addressing. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3129.08)'>This language has helped us to write the kind of fast type code that we want, that we have to have to operate the time-sharing system, and at the same time it's, it's given us a lot of flexibility. </span><br><br><span id='full_1' onclick='player.seekTo(3145.38)'><mark>It's also the phrase structure of the MOL designed to sort of match with the broad structure of NLS, so we've got a WHILE <b>statement</b>; to see what's in that WHILE <b>statement</b> I can move down and see, it's 3 <b>statement</b>s which is an IF <b>statement</b>...the IF <b>statement</b> is two, is a single IF <b>statement</b> which has an IF and ELSE part that the whole block opens up to all of that. </mark></span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3172.67)'>So by using the MOL like this, I'm able to move around very quickly in my MOL <b>file</b>s, also able to sort of zoom in and out of things. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3183.75)'>One of the, besides these sort of program organizational benefits that we get from designing all the special purpose languages, we've been able to design a syntax of these languages so that they shift with our <b>link</b>ing structure in the conventions that we've set up in the _______ to help us in NLS itself to move around between them. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3209.3)'>One of the ways we'd managed to implement all of these languages is by designing a compiler <b>complier</b> which we call trimeter. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3221.77)'>All of our compilers are written in trimeter. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3223.48)'>I'd like to add that we're really thankful to some people at Systems Development Corporation for helping us get started on lot of notions in trimeter, Erwin Book and Val Shaurie have been just invaluable in helping us get started. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3240.59)'>By having all of our <b>complier</b>s written in a high level language themselves, we've been able to change them all the time so we're not only able to quickly modify the syntax of the control language for NLS itself or the meaning itself of the commands by, by working on a high level language but we're also able to go in and just change the compilers as quickly as we have to, to accommodate all sorts of new hardware features and experimenting that we do like that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3273.05)'>See in a system guide <b>file</b>, there're three sections. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3275.92)'>The first one serves as program structure in the picture and those fast <b>link</b>s we looked at were sort of aids that the system programmers have built up. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3285.14)'>They just move back and forth and leave note. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3287.62)'>Second section here is irretrievable, I think I'll let that go for a while right now. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3292.05)'>The third section, more notes the programmers leave around about <b>bug</b>s, things that are wrong with our system right now, I got my blank line, well, anyway, one of the interesting things that NLS does, just an advantage of being online here is it keeps track of who you are and what you're doing all the time. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3317.13)'>So on these <b>statement</b>s, on everything, every <b>statement</b> that you write, it keeps track of who you are and when you did it, so not only can people leave notes around for each other but sort of automate it into how they, automated aids here that tells us who did it, when they did it. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3335.35)'>I can set up search patterns; I think these probably will be talked about later. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3341.05)'>So that's sort of summarizes what this thing look like and how it's put together. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3348.23)'>Is there anything that I

</span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3383.26)'>Well Jack can you, how about going back to that place in the control mother language where you start down the dialogue protocol a person would

one level down now, right! </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3417.03)'>Now all those things in parentheses that in NLS are the names of those <b>statement</b>s, are actually in the

that it's easy to get under view the...don't ever say I, and if he hits a \u201cD\u201d and it sets up what it says there, you can now pop one level below it and that's the next block down in this special language and you see, well if after the \u201cD\u201d he had something else like a \u201cW\u201d it goes on from there to say what it is the computer's supposed to do in response. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(3489.5)'>So this language here and its hierarchical structure resembling the branching tree of choices the user makes, specifying it at every point at what

keyword, is very powerful and could very well warrant a whole paper on itself, because it gives us the power of keyword descriptive kind of organization but with the added feature of giving weights to the keyword, so the results of the search as you see right here are ordered, so that this one ended up meeting the most requirements and adding the most weight. </mark></span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5420.14)'>And down here, could be one that only associated with one of the descriptors and the lowest weight one at that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5428.15)'>So you have an order in this that's probably in relevance. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5431.03)'>And then right with us are all the <b>link</b>s, use that as a <b>link</b> to go off to the <b>file</b> to find it. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5437.37)'>This is a directory of the set of procedures. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5441.07)'>So here's a procedure, here's a list of procedures for those <b>keywords</b> he chose that all describe certain things about <b>file</b> handling and this will take you off on the actual source code. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5451.55)'>It's like Don Andrews wrote them all in his <b>file</b>s, the name of the place in his <b>file</b>s and the views that you should open up so that when you follow this and I <b>jump</b> the <b>link</b>, you just see bingo - the overall view of that procedure. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5465.27)'>And then, as he pointed out, instead of saying, \u201cJump the <b>link</b>.\u201d you can <b>jump</b> to a name within this <b>file</b> where these things have descriptive material about that too. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5472.92)'>So, I think for the software guide, it's very powerful. </span><br><br><span

combination of techniques for getting around inside of the structured software <b>file</b>s and the way in which it is organized, the way in which a special purpose language as we've developed fit

</span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5509.26)'>To have some of the software people there in our open <b>house</b>, really show you what's what by taking you through that. </span><br><br><span

onclick='player.seekTo(5540.91)'>Other things we're going to talk about very quickly are the range of activities underneath in our program and I will just go very quickly through these then. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5552.66)'>A service system development and user system development would...to talk about those a bit only requires me to establish a distinction between those two kinds of systems. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5564.55)'>Really, we've taken to splitting the overall main computer system into this dichotomy of these two systems, where the service system is what appears at the terminal - when I push button, this button, I get that response. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5579.37)'>When I do this, I get that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5580.93)'>It's the repertoire of commands and the services that, that organization of software and hardware and sometimes people gives to me. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5591.7)'>The user system is what's beyond that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5594.07)'>Given all that, what do I do with it? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5595.62)'>What kinds of conventions for leaving messages, for using the content analyzer and for organizing our <b>file</b>s? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5601.32)'>How do we use the <b>link</b>s and the keyword thing, user system there? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5605.62)'>And this is something that is kind of  a new element in systems research that we're trying to establish whilst we can integrate that kind of user system more with the people's methods, the concepts that they use, the procedures, the skills - all are developed in coordination with the kinds of tools that they have. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5625.47)'>Within our __, we also have an explicit activity they call management

</span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5643.55)'>So we are beginning to develop some of those and we'd be happy to talk to you about those during open <b>house</b>. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5649.56)'>And our forthcoming involvement is this __ computer network, the experimental network that's going to come into being in its first form in about a year and end up

A relatively standard typewriter keyboard is supplemented by a five-key <b>handset</b> used (optionally) for entry of <b>control</b> codes and brief literals. An SRI cursor device called the \"mouse\" is used for screen point<b>ing</b> and selection.<br><br>The \"mouse\" is a hand-held X-Y transducer usable on any flat surface; it is described in greater detail further on.<br><br>Special-purpose. high-level languages and associated compilers provide rapid, flexible development and modification of the repertoire of service functions and of their <b>control</b> procedures (the latter be<b>ing</b> the detailed user actions and computer feedback involved in <b>control</b>l<b>ing</b> the application of these service functions) .<br><br>User files are organized as hierarchical structures of data entities, each composed of arbitrary combinations of text and <b>figures</b>. A repertoire of coordinated service features enables a skilled user to compose, study, and mod ify these files with great speed and flexibility, and to have searches, analyses data manipulation, etc. executed. In particular, <b>spec</b>ial sets of conventions, functions, and work<b>ing</b> methods have been developed to air programm<b>ing</b>, logical design, documentation, retrieval, project management, team interaction, and hard copy production. <br><br><br>INTRODUCTION<br><br>In the Augmented Human Intellect (AHI) Research Center at Stanford Research Institute a group of researchers is develop<b>ing</b> an experimental laboratory around an interactive, multi-console computer-<b>display</b> system, and is work<b>ing</b> to learn the principles by which interactive computer aids can augment their intellectual capability.<br><br>The research objective is to develop principles and techniques for design<b>ing</b> an \"augmentation system.\"<br><br>This includes concern not only for the technology of provid<b>ing</b> interactive computer service, but also for changes both in ways of conceptualiz<b>ing</b>, visualiz<b>ing</b>, and organiz<b>ing</b> work<b>ing</b> material, and in procedures and methods for work<b>ing</b> individually and cooperatively.<br><br>The research approach is strongly empirical. At the workplace of each member of the subject group we aim to provide nearly full-time availability of a CRT work station, and then to work continuously to improve both the service available at the stations and the aggregate value derived therefrom by the group over the entire range of its roles and activities.<br><br>Thus the research group is also the subject group in the experiment.<br><br>Among the <b>spec</b>ial activities of the group are the evolutionary development of a complex hardware-softwalre system, the design of new task procedures for the system's users, and careful documentation of the evolv<b>ing</b> system designs and user procedures.<br><br>The group also has the usual activities of manag<b>ing</b> its activities, keep<b>ing</b> up with outside developments, publish<b>ing</b> reports, etc.<br><br>Hence, the particulars of the augmentation system evolv<b>ing</b> here will reflect the nature of these task--i.e., the system is aimed at augment<b>ing</b> a system-development project team. Though the primary research goal is to develop principles of analysis and design so as to understand how to augment human capability, choos<b>ing</b> the researchers them selves as subjects yields as valuable secondary benefit a system tailored to help develop com plex computer-based systems.<br><br>This \"bootstrap\" group has the interest<b>ing</b> (recursive) assignment of develop<b>ing</b> tools and techniques to make it more effective at carry<b>ing</b> out its assignment.<br><br>Its tangible product is a develop<b>ing</b> augmentation system to provide increased capability for develop<b>ing</b> and study<b>ing</b> augmenta tion systems.<br><br>This system can hopefully be transferred, as a whole or by pieces of concept, principle and technique, to help others develop augmentation systems for aid<b>ing</b> many other disciplines and activities.<br><br>In other words we are concentrat<b>ing</b> fully upon reach<b>ing</b> the point where we can do all of our work on line--plac<b>ing</b> in computer store all of our <b>spec</b>ifications, plans, designs, programs, documentation, reports, memos, bibliography and reference notes, etc., and do<b>ing</b> all of our scratch work, plann<b>ing</b>, design<b>ing</b>, de<b>bug</b>g<b>ing</b>, etc., and a good deal of our intercommunication, via the consoles.<br><br>We are try<b>ing</b> to maximize the coverage of our documentation, us<b>ing</b> it as a dynamic and plastic structure that we continually develop and alter to represent the current state of our evolv<b>ing</b> goals, plans, progress, knowledge, designs, procedures, and data.<br><br>The <b>display</b>-computer system to support this experiment is just (at this writ<b>ing</b>) becom<b>ing</b> operational. Its functional features serve a basic <b>display</b>-oriented user system that we have evolved over five years and through three other computers. Below are described the principal features of these systems. <br> <br><br>THE USER SYSTEM<br><br>Basic Facility<br><br>As \"seen\" by the user, the basic facility has the follow<b>ing</b> characteristics:<br><br>CRT consoles, of which 10 are normally located in offlces of AHI research staff.<br><br>The consoles are served by an SDS 940 time-shar<b>ing</b> computer dedicated to full-time service for this staff, and each console may operate entirely independently of the others.<br><br>Each individual has private file space, and the group has community space, on a high-speed disc with a capacity of 96 million characters.<br><br>The system is not intended to serve a general community of time-shar<b>ing</b> users, but is be<b>ing</b> shaped in its entire design toward the <b>spec</b>ial needs of the \"bootstrapp<b>ing</b>\" experiment. <br> <br><br>Work Stations<br><br>As noted above, each work station is equipped with a <b>display</b>, an alphanumeric keyboard, a mouse, and a five-key <b>handset</b>.<br><br>The <b>display</b> at each of the workstations (see Figure 1) is provided on a high-resolution, closed-circuit <b>television</b> monitor. <br><br>FIGURE 1--Typical work station with TV <b>display</b>, typewriter keyboard, mouse and chord <b>handset</b><br><br>The alphanumeric keyboard is similar to a Teletype keyboard. It has 96 normal characters in two cases. A third-case shift key provides for future expansion, and two <b>spec</b>ial keys are used for system <b>control</b>.<br><br>The mouse produces two analog voltages. As the two wheels (see Figure 2) rotate, each chang<b>ing</b> in proportion to the X or Y movement over the table top. <br>  <br>FIGURE 2 -- Underside of the Mouse<br><br>These voltages <b>control</b>, via an A/D converter, the computer's memory, and the <b>display</b> generator, the coordinates of a track<b>ing</b> spot with which the user may \"point\" to positions on the screen.<br><br>Three buttons on top of the mouse are used for <b>spec</b>ial <b>control</b>.<br><br>A set of experiments, compar<b>ing</b> (within our techniques of interaction) the relative speed and accuracy obtained with this and other selection devices showed the mouse to be better than a light pen or a joystick (see Refs. English 1 and English 2).<br><br>Compared to a light pen, it is generally less awkward and fatigu<b>ing</b> to use, and it has a decided advantage for use with raster-scan, write-through storage tube, projection, or multiviewer <b>display</b> systems.<br><br>The five-key <b>handset</b> has 31 chords or unique key-stroke combinations, in five \"cases.\"<br><br>The first four cases contain lower and upper-case letters and punctuation, digits, and <b>spec</b>ial characters. (The chords for the letters correspond to the binary numbers from 1 to 26.)<br><br>The fifth case is \"<b>control</b> case.\" A particular chord (the same chord in each case) will always transfer subsequent in put-chord interpretations to <b>control</b> case.<br><br>In <b>control</b> case, one can \"backspace\" through recent input, <b>spec</b>ify underlin<b>ing</b> for subsequent input, transfer to another case, visit another case for one character or one word, etc.<br><br>One-handed typ<b>ing</b> with the <b>handset</b> is slower than two-handed typ<b>ing</b> with the standard keyboard. However, when the user works with one hand on the <b>handset</b> and one on the mouse, the coordinated interspersion of <b>control</b> characters and short literal str<b>ing</b>s from one hand with mouse <b>control</b> actions from the other yields con siderable advantage in speed and smooth ness of operation.<br><br>For literal str<b>ing</b>s longer than about ten characters, one tends to transfer from the <b>handset</b> to the normal key board.<br><br>Both from general experience and from <b>spec</b>ific experiment, it seems that enough <b>handset</b> skill to make its use worthwhile can generally be achieved with about five hours of practice. Beyond this, skill grows with usage. <br> <br><br>Structure of Files<br><br>Our work<b>ing</b> information is organized into files, with flexible means for users to set up indices and directories, and to hop from file to file by <b>display</b>-selection or by typed-in file-name designations. Each file is highly structured in its internal organization.<br><br>The <b>spec</b>ific structure of a given file is determined by the user, and is an important part of his conceptual and \"study-manipulate\" treatment of the file.<br><br>The introduction of explicit \"structur<b>ing</b>\" to our work<b>ing</b> information stems from a very basic feature of our conceptual framework (see Refs. Engelbart1 and Engelbart2) regard<b>ing</b> means for augment<b>ing</b> human intellect.<br><br>With the view that the symbols one works with are supposed to represent a mapp<b>ing</b> of one's associated concepts, and further that one's concepts exist in a \"network\" of relationships as opposed to the essentially linear form of actual printed records, it was decided that the concept manipulation aids derivable from real-time computer support could be appreciably enhanced by structur<b>ing</b> conventions that would make explicit (for both the user and the computer) the various types of network relationships among concepts.<br><br>As an experiment with this concept, we adopted some years ago the convention of organiz<b>ing</b> all information into explicit hierarchical structures, with provisions for arbitrary cross-referenc<b>ing</b> among the ele ments of a hierarchy.<br><br>The principal manifestation of this hierarchical structure is the break<b>ing</b> up of text into arbitrary segments called \"<b>statements</b>,\" each of which bears a number show<b>ing</b> its serial location in the text and its \"level\" in an \"outline\" of the text. This paper is an example of hierarchical text structure.<br><br>To set up a reference link from Statement A to Statement B, one may refer in Statement A either to the location number of B or to the \"name\" of B. The difference is that the number is vulnerable to subsequent structural change, whereas the name stays with the statement through changes in the structure around it.<br><br>By convention, the first word of a statement is treated as the name of the statement, if it is enclosed in paren theses. For instance, Statement 0 on the screen of Figure 1 is named \"FJCC.\"<br><br>References to these names may be embedded anywhere in other <b>statements</b>, for instance as \"see(AFI),\" where <b>spec</b>ial format informs the viewer explicitly that this refers to a statement named \"AFI,\" or merely as a str<b>ing</b> of char acters in a context such that the viewer can infer the referenc<b>ing</b>.<br><br>This nam<b>ing</b> and link<b>ing</b>, when added to the basic hierarchical form, yields a highly flexible general structur<b>ing</b> capability. These structur<b>ing</b> conventions are expected to evolve relatively rapidly as our research progresses.<br><br>For some material, the structured statement form may be undesirable. In these cases, there are means for suppress <b>ing</b> the <b>spec</b>ial formatt<b>ing</b> in the final print out of the structured text.<br><br>The basic validity of the structured text approach has been well established by our subsequent experience.<br><br>We have found that in both off-line and on-line computer aids, the conception, stipulation, and execution of significant manipulations are made much easier by the structur<b>ing</b> conventions.<br><br>Also, in work<b>ing</b> on line at a CRT console, not only is manipulation made much easier and more powerful by the structure, but a user's ability to get about very quickly within his dataJ and to have <b>spec</b>ial \"views\" of it generated to suit his need, are significantly aided by the structure.<br><br>We have come to write all of our documentation, notes, reports, and proposals accord<b>ing</b> to these conventions, because of the result<b>ing</b> increase in our ability to study and manipulate them dur<b>ing</b> composition, modification, and usage. Our programm<b>ing</b> systems also incorporate the conventions. We have found it to be fairly universal that after an initial period of negative reaction in read<b>ing</b> explicitly structured material, one comes to prefer it to material printed in the normal form. <br> <br><br>File Study<b>ing</b><br><br>The computer aids are used for two principal \"study<b>ing</b>\" operations, both concerned with construction of the user's \"views\", i.e., the portion of his work<b>ing</b> text that he sees on the screen at a given moment.<br><br>Display Start<br><br>The first operation is find<b>ing</b> a particular statement in the file (called the \"<b>display</b> start\"); the view will then begin with that statement. This is equivalent to find<b>ing</b> the beginn<b>ing</b> of a par ticular passage in a hard-copy document.<br><br>Form of View<br><br>The second operation is the <b>spec</b>ification of a \"form\" of view\u00d1it may simply consist of a screenful of text which sequentially follows the point <b>spec</b>ified as the <b>display</b> start, or it may be constructed in other ways, frequently so as to give the effect of an outline.<br><br>In normal, off-line document study<b>ing</b>, one often does the first type of operation, but the second is like a sissors-and staple job and is rarely done just to aid one's study<b>ing</b>.<br><br>(A third type of service operation that will undoubtedly be of significant aid to study<b>ing</b> is question answer<b>ing</b>. We do not have this type of service.)<br><br>Specification of Display Start<br><br>The <b>display</b> start may be <b>spec</b>ified in several ways:<br><br>By direct selection of a statement which is on the <b>display</b>\u00d1the user simply points to any character in the statement, us<b>ing</b> the mouse.<br><br>If the desired <b>display</b> start is not on the <b>display</b>, it may be selected in directly if it bears a \"marker.\"<br><br>Markers are normally invisible. A marker has a name of up to five characters, and is attached to a character of the text. Referr<b>ing</b> to the marker by name (while hold<b>ing</b> down a <b>spec</b>ial button) is exactly equivalent to point<b>ing</b> to the character with the mouse.<br><br>The <b>control</b> procedures make it extremely quick and easy to fix and call markers.<br><br>By furnish<b>ing</b> either the name or the location number of the statement, which can be done in either of two basic way:<br><br>Typ<b>ing</b> from the keyboard<br><br>Select<b>ing</b> an occurrence of the name or number in the text. This may be done either directly or via an in direct marker selection.<br><br>After identify<b>ing</b> a statement by one of the above means, the user may request to be taken directly there for his next view. Alternately, he may request instead that he be taken to some statement bear<b>ing</b> a <b>spec</b>ified structure relationship to the one <b>spec</b>ifically identified. </div><div id='full_0'><mark>For instance, when the user identifies Statement 3E4 by one of the above means (assume it to be a member of the list 3E1 through 3E7), he may ask to be taken to<br><br>Its successor, i.e., Statement 3E5<br><br>Its predecessor, i.e., Statement 3E3<br><br>Its list tail, i.e., Statement 3E7<br><br>Its list head, i.e., Statement 3E1<br><br>Its list source, i.e., Statement 3E<br><br>Its subhead, i.e., Statement 3E4A<br><br>Besides be<b>ing</b> taken to an explicitly identified statement, a user may ask to go to the first statement in the file (or the next after the current location) that contains a <b>spec</b>ified word or str<b>ing</b> of char acters.</mark></div><div><br><br>He may <b>spec</b>ify the search str<b>ing</b> by typ<b>ing</b> it in, by direct (mouse) selection, or by indirect (marker) selection.<br><br>Specification of Form of View<br><br>The \"normal\" view beginn<b>ing</b> at a given location is like a frame cut out from a long scroll upon which the hierarchical set of <b>statements</b> is printed in sequential order. Such a view is <b>display</b>ed in Figure 1.<br><br>Otherwise, three independently variable view-<b>spec</b>ification conditions may be applied to the construction of the <b>display</b>ed view: level clipp<b>ing</b>, line truncation, and content filter<b>ing</b>. The view is simultaneous ly affected by all three of these.<br><br>Level: Given a <b>spec</b>ified level parameter, L (L 1, 2, ...., ALL), the view generator will <b>display</b> only those <b>statements</b> whose \"depth\" is less than or equal to L. (For example, Statement 3E4 is third level, 3E second, 4B2C1 fifth, etc.) Thus it is possible to see only first level <b>statements</b>, or only first-, second-, and third level <b>statements</b>, for example.<br><br>Truncation: Given a <b>spec</b>ified truncation parameter, T (T = 1, 2, ..., ALL), the view generator will show only the first T lines of each statement be<b>ing</b> <b>display</b>ed.<br><br>Content: Given a <b>spec</b>ification for desired content (written in a <b>spec</b>ial high-level content-analysis language) the view generator optionally can be directed to <b>display</b> only those <b>statements</b> that have the <b>spec</b>ified content.<br><br>One can <b>spec</b>ify simple str<b>ing</b>s, or logical combinations thereof, or such th<b>ing</b>s as hav<b>ing</b> the word \"memory\" within four words of the word \"alloca tion.\"<br><br>Content <b>spec</b>ifications are written as text, anywhere in the file. Thus the full power of the system may be used for compos<b>ing</b> and modify<b>ing</b> them.<br><br>Any one content <b>spec</b>ification can then be chosen for application (by select <b>ing</b> it directly or indirectly). It is compiled immediately to produce a machine code content-analysis routine, which is then ready to \"filter\" <b>statements</b> for the view generator.<br><br>In addition, the follow<b>ing</b> format features of the <b>display</b> may be independently varied: indentation of <b>statements</b> accord <b>ing</b> to level, suppression of location num bers and/or names of <b>statements</b>, and separation of <b>statements</b> by blank lines.<br><br>The user <b>control</b>s these view <b>spec</b>ifications by means of brief, mnemonic character codes. A skilled user will readjust his view to suit immediate needs very quickly and frequently; for example, he may change level and truncation sett<b>ing</b>s several times in as many seconds.<br><br>\"Freez<b>ing</b>\" Statements<br><br>One may also pre-empt an arbitrary amount of the upper portion of the screen for hold<b>ing</b> a collection of \"frozen\" <b>statements</b>. The remain<b>ing</b> lower portion is treated as a reduced-size scann<b>ing</b> frame, and the view generator follows the same rules for fill<b>ing</b> it as described above.<br><br>The frozen <b>statements</b> may be independently chosen or dismissed, each may have line truncation independent of the rest, and the order in which they are <b>display</b>ed is arbitrary and readily changed. Any screen-select operand for any command may be selected from any portion of the <b>display</b> (includ<b>ing</b> the frozen <b>statements</b>) .<br><br>Examples<br><br>Figures 3 and 4 show views generated from the same start<b>ing</b> point with different level-clipp<b>ing</b> parameters. This example happens to be of a program written in our Machine-Oriented language (MOL, see below). <br><br>Figure 3 -- View of Part of an MOL Program, Level parameter = 2, truncation parameter = 1<br><br>Figure 4 -- Same Program as Figure 3, but with with level parameter changed to ALL. <br>3d5b Figure 5, demonstrates the freez<b>ing</b> feature with a view of a program (the same one shown in Figure 8) written in our Control Metalanguage (CML, see below). Statemente 3C, 3C2, 2B, 2Bl, 2B2, 2B3, and 2B4 are frozen, and <b>statements</b> from 2J on are shown normally with L = 3, T = 1. <br><br>Figure 5 -- View of a CML Program, show<b>ing</b> the frozen <b>statements</b> and illustrat<b>ing</b> use of reference hopp<b>ing</b><br><br><br>The freez<b>ing</b> here was used to hold for simultaneous view four different functionally related process descriptions. The <b>subroutines</b> (+BUG1SPEC) and (+ WAIT were located by use of the hop-to-name feature described above.<br><br>File Modification<br><br>Here we use a standard set of edit<b>ing</b> operations, <b>spec</b>ify<b>ing</b> with each operation a particular type of text entity.<br><br>Operations: Delete, Insert, Replace, Move, Copy.<br><br>Entities (within text of <b>statements</b>): Character, Text (arbitrary str<b>ing</b>s), Word, Visible (print str<b>ing</b>), Invisible (gap str<b>ing</b>) .<br><br>Entities (for structure manipulation): Statement, Branch (statement plus all substructure), Group (sublist of branches), Plex (complete list of branches).<br><br>Structure may also be modified by join<b>ing</b> <b>statements</b>, or break<b>ing</b> a statement into two at a <b>spec</b>ified point.<br><br>Generally, an operation and an entity make up a command, such as \"Delete Word.\" To <b>spec</b>ify the command, the user types the first letter of each word in the command: thus \"DW\" <b>spec</b>ifies \"Delete Word.\" There are occasional cases where a third word is used or where the first letter cannot be used because of ambiguities.<br><br>File Output<br><br>Files may be sent to any of a number of different output devices to produce hardcopy\u00d1an upper/lower-case line printer, anon-line high-quality typewriter, or paper tape to drive various typewriters.<br><br>In future it will be possible to send files via magnetic tape to an off-line CRT-to-film system from which we can produce Xerox prints, Multilith masters, or microform records.<br><br>Flexible format <b>control</b> may be exercised in this process by means of <b>spec</b>ially coded directives embedded in the files\u00d1runn<b>ing</b> headers, page number<b>ing</b>, line lengths, line center<b>ing</b>, suppression of location numbers, indent<b>ing</b>, right justification (hyphenless), etc., are <b>control</b>lable features.<br><br>Compil<b>ing</b> and De<b>bug</b>g<b>ing</b><br><br>Source-code files written in any of our compiler languages (see below), or in the SDS 940 assembly language (ARPAS, in which our compiler output is produced) may be compiled under on-line <b>control</b>. For de<b>bug</b>g<b>ing</b>, we have made a trivial addition to the SDS 940's DDT loader-de<b>bug</b>ger so as to operate it from the CRT <b>display</b>s. Though it was designed to operate from a Teletype terminal, this system gains a great deal in speed and power by merely show<b>ing</b> with a <b>display</b> the last 26 lines of what would have been on the Teletype output.<br><br>Calculat<b>ing</b><br><br>The same small innovation as mentioned above for DDT enables us to use the CAL system from a <b>display</b> terminal.<br><br>Conferenc<b>ing</b><br><br>We have set up a room <b>spec</b>ially equipped for on-line conferenc<b>ing</b>. Six <b>display</b>s are arranged in the center of a square table (see Figure 6) so that each of twenty participants has good visibility. One participant <b>control</b>s the system, and all <b>display</b>s show the same view. The other participants have mice that <b>control</b> a large arrrow on the screen, for use as a pointer (with no <b>control</b> function). <br>  <br>FIGURE 6--On-line conference arrangement<br><br>As a quick means of find<b>ing</b> and <b>display</b> <b>ing</b> (with appropriate forms of view) any desired material from a very large collection, this system is a powerful aid to presentation and review conferences.<br><br>We are also experiment<b>ing</b> with it in project meet<b>ing</b>s, us<b>ing</b> it not only to keep track of agenda items and changes but also to log progress notes, action notes, etc. The review aid is of course highly useful here also.<br><br>We are anxious to see what <b>spec</b>ial conventions and procedures will evolve to allow us to harness a number of independent consoles within a conference group. This obviously has considerable potential. <br> <br><br>SERVICE-SYSTEM SOFTWARE<br><br>The User's Control Laguage<br><br>Consider the service a user gets from the computer to be in the form of discrete operations--i. e., the execution of individual \"service functions\" from a repertoire compris<b>ing</b> a \"service system.\"<br><br>Examples of service functions are delet<b>ing</b> a word, replac<b>ing</b> a character, hopp<b>ing</b> to a name, etc.<br><br>Associated with each function of this repertoire is a \"<b>control</b>-dialogue procedure.\" This procedure involves select<b>ing</b> a service function from the repertoire, sett<b>ing</b> up the necessary parameter designations for a particular application, recover<b>ing</b> from user errors, and call<b>ing</b> for the execution of the function.<br><br>The procedure is made up of the sequence of keystrokes, select actions, etc. made by the user, together with the interspersed feedback messages from the computer.<br><br>The repertoire of service functions, together with their <b>control</b>-dialogue procedures, constitutes the user's \"<b>control</b> language.\" This is a language for a \"master-slave\" dialogue, enabl<b>ing</b> the user to <b>control</b> application of the computer's capabilities to his own service.<br><br>It seems clear that significant augmentation of one's intellectual effectiveness from the harness<b>ing</b> of computer services will require development of a broad and sophisticated <b>control</b>-language vocabulary.<br><br>It follows that the evolution of such a <b>control</b> language is a very important part of augmentation-system research.<br><br>For the designer of user systems, it is important to have good means for <b>spec</b>ify<b>ing</b> the nature of the functions and their re<b>spec</b> tive <b>control</b>-dialogue procedures, so that a design <b>spec</b>ification will be<br><br>Concise, so that its essential features are easily seen<br><br>Unambiguous, so that questions about the design may be answered clearly<br><br>Canonical, so that information is easily located<br><br>Natural, so that the form of the de scription fits the conceptual frame of the design<br><br>Easy to compose, study, and modify, so that the process of evolutionary design can be facilitated.<br><br>It is also important for the user to have a description of the service functions and their <b>control</b>-dialogue procedures.<br><br>The description must again be concise, unambiguous, canonical, and natural; furthermore, it must be accurate, in that everyth<b>ing</b> relevant to the user about the service functions and their <b>control</b>-dialogue procedures is described, and everyth<b>ing</b> described actually works as indicated.<br><br>State-Chart Representation of Control-Language Design<br><br>Figure 7 shows a chart<b>ing</b> method that was used in earlier stages of our work for design<b>ing</b> and <b>spec</b>ify<b>ing</b> the <b>control</b>-pro cedure portions of the <b>control</b> language. Even though limited to describ<b>ing</b> only the <b>control</b>-dialogue procedures, this representation nonetheless served very well and led us to develop the successive techniques described below.<br><br>Figure 7 shows actual <b>control</b> procedures for four service functions from the repertoire of an interactive system: Delete Word, Delete Text, Place Up Statement, and Forward Statement.<br><br>The boxes contain abbreviated descriptions of relevant <b>display</b>-feedback conditions, represent<b>ing</b> the intermediate states between successive user actions. Both to illustrate how the chart<b>ing</b> conventions are used and to give some feel<b>ing</b> for the dynamics of our user-system con trol procedures, we describe briefly below both the chart symbols and the associated <b>display</b>-feedback conventions that we have developed.<br><br>The writ<b>ing</b> at the top of each box indicates what is to be shown as \"command feedback\" at the top of the <b>display</b> (see Figures 3, 4 and 5).<br><br>An uparrow sometimes appears under the first character of one of the words of Command Feedback.<br><br>This indicates to the user that the next character he types will be interpreted as designat<b>ing</b> a new term to replace that be<b>ing</b> pointed to--no uparrow under Command Feedback signifies that keyboard ac tion will not affect the command designation.<br><br>\"Entity\" represents the entity word (i.e., \"character,\" \"word, \"statement,\" etc.) that was last used as part of a fully <b>spec</b>ified command.<br><br>The computer often \"offers\" the user an entity option.<br><br>The circle in the box indicates the character to be used for the \"<b>bug</b>\" (the track<b>ing</b> spot), which alternates between the characters uparrow and plus.<br><br>The uparrow indicates that a select action is appropriate, and the plus indicates that a select action is inappropriate.<br><br>The str<b>ing</b> of X's, with under lines, indicates that the selected char acters are to be underlined as a means of show<b>ing</b> the user what the computer thinks he has selected.<br><br>There is frequently an X on the output line from a box on the chart. This indicates that the computer is to wait until the user has made another action.<br><br>After this next action, the computer follows a branch<b>ing</b> path, depend<b>ing</b> upon what the action was (as indicated on the chart) to reach another state-description box or one of the function-execution processes.<br><br>The Control Metalanguage<br><br>In search for an improvement over the state chart, we looked for the follow<b>ing</b> <b>spec</b>ial features, as well as the general features ted above:<br><br>A representational form us<b>ing</b> structural text so as to harness the power of our on-line text-manipulation techniques for compos<b>ing</b>, study<b>ing</b>, and modify<b>ing</b> our designs.<br><br>A form that would allow us to <b>spec</b>ify the service functions as well as the <b>control</b> dialogue procedures.<br><br>A form such that a design-description file could be translated by a computer program into the actual implementation of the <b>control</b> language.<br><br>Us<b>ing</b> our Tree Meta compiler-compiler (described below), we have developed a next step forward in our means of design<b>ing</b>, <b>spec</b>ify<b>ing</b>, implement<b>ing</b> and document<b>ing</b> our on-line <b>control</b> languages. The result is called \"Control Metalanguage\" (CML).<br><br>Figure 8 shows a portion of the description for the current <b>control</b> language, written in Control Metalanguage.<br><br>This language is the means for describ<b>ing</b> both the service functions and their <b>control</b>-dialogue procedures.<br><br>The Control Metalanguage Translator (CMLT) can process a file contain<b>ing</b> such a description, to produce a correspond<b>ing</b> version of an interactive system which responds to user actions exactly as described in the file.<br><br>There is a strong correspondence between the conventions for represent<b>ing</b> the <b>control</b> procedures in Control Metalanguage and in the state chart, as a comparison of Figures 8 and 7 will reveal.<br><br>The particular example printed out for Figure 8 was chosen because it <b>spec</b>ifies some of the same procedures as in Figure 7.<br><br>For instance, the steps of <b>display</b> feedback states, lead<b>ing</b> to execution of the \"Delete Word\" function, can readily be followed in the state chart.<br><br>The steps are produced by the user typ<b>ing</b> \"D,\" then \"W,\" then select <b>ing</b> a character in a given word, and then hitt<b>ing</b> \"command accept\" (the CA key).<br><br></div><div id='full_4'><mark>The correspond<b>ing</b> steps are outlined below for the Control Metalanguage description of Figure 8, progress<b>ing</b> from Statement 3, to Statement 3c, to Statement 3c2, to Subroutine +BUGSPEC, etc.</mark></div><div> <br><br>FIGURE 8 --- Metalanguage description of part of <b>control</b> language <br>3 (wc:) zap case <br><br>3A (b) [edit] <b>dsp</b>(backward tes*) . case  <br>.  <br>.  <br>.  <br>3B (c) [edit] <b>dsp</b>(copy ^es*) :s true => <am>adj1: . </div><div id='full_2'><mark>case <br><br>3Bl (c) s*=cc <b>dsp</b>(^copy character) e*=c,character +<b>bug</b>2<b>spec</b>  <br>+cdlim(b1,p1,p2,p3,p4) +cdlim(b2,p5,p6,p7,p8)  <br>+cpchtx(b1,p2,p4,pS,p6); <br><br>3B2 (w) s*=cw <b>dsp</b>(^copy word) e*=w,word +<b>bug</b>2<b>spec</b>  <br>+wdr2(b1,p1,p2,p3,p4) +wdr2(b2,p5,p6,p7,p8)  <br>+cpwdvs(b1,p2,p4,p5,p6); <br><br>3B3 (l) s*=cl <b>dsp</b>(^copy line) e*=l,line +<b>bug</b>2<b>spec</b>  <br>+ldlim(b1,p1,p2,p3,p4) +ldlim(b2,p5,p6,p7,p8) :c st b1<-sf(b1) p2,  <br>rif :p p2>p1 cr: then (cr) else (null) , p5 p6, p4 se(b1): goto  <br>[s] <br><br>3B4 (v) s*=cv <b>dsp</b>(^copy visible) e*=v,visible +<b>bug</b>2<b>spec</b>  <br>+vdr2(b1,p1,p2,p3,p4) +vdr2(b2,p5,p6,p7,p8)  <br>+cpwdvs(b1,p2,p4,p5,p6) ;  <br>.</mark></div><div>  <br>.  <br>.  <br>3b10 endcase +caqm ; <br><br>3C (d) [edit] <b>dsp</b>(delete ^es*) . </div><div id='full_3'><mark>case <br><br>3C1 (c) s*=dc <b>dsp</b>(^delete character) e*=c,character +<b>bug</b>1<b>spec</b>  <br>+cdlim(b1,p1,p2,p3,p4) +del; <br><br>3C2 (w) s*=dw <b>dsp</b>(^delete word) e*=w,word +<b>bug</b>1<b>spec</b> +wdr  <br>(b1,p1,p2,p3,p4) +del ;  <br>3C3 (l) s*=-dl <b>dsp</b>(^delete line) e*=l,line +<b>bug</b>1<b>spec</b>...  <br>.</mark></div><div>  <br>.  <br>. <br><br></div><div id='full_1'><mark>The points or regions in Figure 7 correspond<b>ing</b> to these <b>statements</b> and <b>subroutines</b> are marked by (3), (3C), (3C2), and (+ BUG1SPEC), to help compare the two representations<br><br>The same steps are indicated in Figure 8, start<b>ing</b> from Statement 3:<br><br>\"D\" sets up the state described in Statement 3C<br><br>\"W\" sets up the state described in Statement 3C2<br><br>The subroutine +BUG1SPEC waits for the select-word (1) and CA (2) actions lead<b>ing</b> to the execution of the delete-word function.</mark></div><div><br><br>Then the TWDR subroutine takes the <b>bug</b>-position parameter and sets pointers P1 through P4 to delimit the word in the text data.<br><br>Finally, the +DEL subroutine deletes what the pointers delimit, and then returns to the last-defined state (i.e., to where S* = DW) .<br><br>Basic Organization of the On-Line System (NLS)<br><br>Figure 9 shows the relationships among the major components of NLS. <br> <br>Figure 9-- Basic organization of NLS show<b>ing</b> use of compilers and compiler-compiler to implement it<br><br>The Tree Meta Translator is a processor <b>spec</b>ially designed to produce new translators.<br><br>There is a <b>spec</b>ial language the Tree Meta Language--for use in describ<b>ing</b> the translator to be produced.<br><br>A <b>spec</b>ial Tree Meta library of <b>subroutines</b> must be used, along with the output of the Tree Meta Translator, to produce a function<b>ing</b> new translator.

Each has general character vector plott<b>ing</b> capability They will accept <b>display</b> buffers consist<b>ing</b> of instructions (beam motion, character writ<b>ing</b>, etc. ) from the <b>control</b>ler.

This allows a <b>display</b> generator to sustain about four times more <b>display</b>ed material than if the users were view<b>ing</b> direct-view refreshed tubes.<br><br>The total cost of small CRT, TV camera, amplifier-<b>control</b>ler, and monitor came to about $ 5500 per workstation-- where a random-deflection, <b>display</b>-qual ity CRT of similar size would cost con siderably more and would be harder to drive remotely.<br><br>Another cost feature which is very important in some system environ ments favors this TV approach: The expensive part is centrally located; each outly<b>ing</b> monitor costs only about $600, so terminals can be set up even where usage will be low, with some video switch<b>ing</b> in the central establishment to take one terminal down and put another up.<br><br>An interest<b>ing</b> feature of the video system is that with the flick of a switch the video signal can be inverted, so that the image picked up as bright lines on dim background may be viewed as black lines on a light background. There is a definite user preference for this inverted form of <b>display</b>.<br><br>In addition to the advantages noted above, the <b>television</b> <b>display</b> also invites the use of such commercially available devices as extra cameras, scan converters, video switches, and video mixers to enrich system service.<br><br>For example, the video image of a user's computer-generated <b>display</b> could be mixed with the image from a camera focused on a collaborator at another terminal; the two users could communicate through both the computer and a voice intercom. Each user would then see the other's face superimposed on the <b>display</b> of data under discussion.<br><br>Superimposed views from cameras focused on film images or draw<b>ing</b>s, or on the computer hardware, might also be useful.<br><br>We have experimented with these techniques (see Figure 11) and found them to be very effective. They promise to add a great deal to the value of remote <b>display</b> terminals. <br>  <br><br>FIGURE 11--Television <b>display</b> obtained by mix<b>ing</b> the video sognal from remote camera with that from the computer-generated <b>display</b><br><br><br>Input-Device Controller<br><br>In addition to the <b>television</b> monitor, each work-station console has a keyboard, binary keyset, and mouse.<br><br>The <b>control</b>ler reads the state of these devices at a preset interval (about 30 milli seconds) and writes it into a fixed location table in core.<br><br>Bits are added to information from the keyboards, keysets and mouse switches to indicate when a new character has been received or a switch has changed state since the last sample. If there is a new character or switch change, an interrupt is issued after the sample period.<br><br>The mouse coordinates are for matted as a beam-position<b>ing</b> instruction to the <b>display</b> generator. Provisions are made in the <b>display</b> <b>control</b>ler for includ<b>ing</b> an entry in the mouse-position table as a <b>display</b> buffer.

Engelbart <br>Stanford Research Institute <br><br>Organisms and Organizations<br><br>I'll take an unlikely start and begin with <b>dinosaurs</b>. I have a six-year-old son who is tremendously impressed and intrigued with <b>dinosaurs</b>. We read and re-read all of the dinosaur books, and every time we go to the library we have to bring home new ones.<br><br>Consider a dinosaur (with what little we know and much we may speculate) as a big, monstrous organism whose specialized organs cooperated reasonably well by the then-prevailing standards of \"organism design\", but whose function was coordinated by a clumsy, crude <b>nervous</b> system and a pitiful little brain. My image of this \"clumsy <b>nervous</b> system\" can be characterized by the story I've heard (or perhaps this is one that I've invented for six-year-old consumption, and now believe) about an embattled dinosaur not sensing for several minutes that it was dead.<br><br>But yet apparently this was an organism marvelously fitted to its environment. The <b>dinosaurs</b> thrived for over 200 million years, as I remember from all those books, much longer than our race has been around. But suddenly -- suddenly in terms of geological time -- they disappeared.<br><br>My learned deduction, derived from first-grade scientific literature, is that competition from better-designed <b>nervous</b> system did them in: better sensors; better sensory-data analyzers (perception); better peripheral contingency decision making (reflexes); better coordination of the functioning of organs, muscles, etc; better rational analyses of events and history; better accumulation of learned experience; better projection, visualization and planning, etc., etc.<br><br>I want to fix in your minds an image of a biological organism that possessed formidable capability within the environment into which it evolved, but which couldn't make the grade against the competition that a continuing evolution brought into that environment.<br><br>Human organizations can be likened to biological organisms, and I find much value in considering the analogy. Organizations evolve too; their mutations are continually emerging and being tested for survival value within their environment. I happen to feel that evolution of their environment is beginning to threaten today's organizations, large and small -- finding them seriously deficient in their \"<b>nervous</b>-system\" design -- and that the degree of coordination, perception, rational adaptation, etc. which will appear in the next generation of human organizations will drive our present organizational forms, with their \"clumsy <b>nervous</b> systems\", into extinction.<br><br>It is these \"<b>nervous</b>-system\" functions, within human organizations, where I find the most significant <b>intellectual</b> complications stemming from the forthcoming multi-access computer networks.<br><br>Augmentation Systems<br><br>For many years I have been developing a research program at Stanford Research Institute aimed at Augmenting the Human Intellect. By intellect I mean the human competence to make, send, exchange and apply to decision-making the commodity called knowledge, as applied toward giving human individuals and organizations more effectiveness at <b>formulating</b> and pursuing their goals. My basic formulation of such a pursuit considers a large system of things to be involved in being <b>intellectual</b>, and being successful at it. A rough but useful categorization of the system's components is as follows:<br><br>Biologically Provided Human (BPH) capabilities are the basic components of this \"large system\" -- e.g., memory, visualization, learning and reasoning, as linked to the human's internal-external environment by sensory-perception and coordinate-motor I/O systems.<br><br>Culturally Provided (CP) items are also basic to this \"large system\": general things such as languages, methodologies, tools, and training; in specific forms such as algebra, schools, meetings, books, computers, maps and filing cabinets. Also, such items as the value structure, <b>attitudes</b>, motivations, etc. which are so important to the way an individual coordinates and directs his BPH capabilities, may similarly be said to be \"culturally provided\".<br><br></div><div id='full_2'><mark>An Effective Individual (EI) has a particular system of these CP items built atop his BPH capabilities.</mark></div><div> Our EI is like a little colony grown around the \"raw-material\" human, where in number and diversity of items this \"ecology\" of interdependent dynamics is as subtle and rich as what we are coming generally to appreciate in the \"organic\" world around us.<br><br>An Effective Organization (EO) is composed of a group of EI components, plus another particular set of CP items associated with their working together.<br><br>These CP items are all candidates for redesign, toward more effective individuals and organizations. To provide a new \"augmentation system\" for an individual, or especially for a group, is a very complex challenge. Just suppose, for instance, that a really new system had been developed, and consider the problem of checking out a group of people on their \"new augmentation system\" -- it would involve such as: teaching them new concepts and skills for representing and manipulating information; changing their working and collaborative methods; having them learn new roles and acquire associated new <b>attitudes</b>; changing the format and style for their <b>formulating</b> and communicating, etc.<br><br>If the system is to represent a truly significant improvement, assume that the changes to which the new users must accommodate will pervade many levels and facets of the \"way of doing their daily work\", and that many of these changes will represent radical departures from their prior \"ways\". The people being given such a new system will have a rough period of learning and adaptation. People don't generally appreciate how many are the \"little ways of doing things\" that comprise our workaday world, that they may be subtly or radically changed, and that among them might appear a very different distribution of usage and importance. The EI and EO systems are more complex, but therefore richer, domains for development than is appreciated even (especially?) among the technologists in the computer and communication disciplines which have so much potential for changing those systems.<br><br>My main message about Augmentation Systems is that, while indeed there are very challenging technical problems involved in supporting tomorrow's Effective Individuals and Organizations, the larger Augmentation System is much more complex than the technological \"subsystem\" upon which it depends. We technologists aren't equipped to perceive this sort of thing, and those who are can't generally distinguish the Sunday-Supplement extrapolations from those more probable. It has been my business to struggle with these concepts for two decades now, and the signs that I read at least tell me that the changes in our ways of thinking and working will be more pervasive and extreme than ANY OF US appreciates -- a revolution like the development of writing and the printing press lumped together. The following notions represent some of the least fuzzy elements that I perceive.<br><br> The Intellectual Workshop<br><br>In the context of this Conference, it is useful to talk about providing an individual with a \"private <b>intellectual</b> work space\" -- sort of what his office is supposed to be for him now.<br><br>In using his office, an individual goes in, perhaps shuts his door, and spreads his current working information over his working surfaces. He keeps some local files there, does some thinking, some <b>formulating</b> and transmitting of messages to the outside, and receiving returning messages, etc. Some of these transmitted formulations are requisitions for things to be bought, made, commented upon, or etc. He sends them out and results will come back, usually in the form of information -- control feedback, substantive information from colleagues or support staff, etc. He digests, stores, reformulates, responds, and occasionally pursues reflective, creative thought.<br><br>The image I'm trying to develop is of an office being the \"<b>intellectual</b> workshop\" in which one does his collaborative bit within his working environment: one needs work spaces, tools to suit a myriad of tasks, places to store working materials, aids to hold them for examination and shaping -- and they all should be easy to reach, quick to adjust to the task, easy to keep track of, etc. Interactive computer aids will have very significant effects here.<br><br>This is the particular area that my group and I have been working on for some six years -- improving the individual's <b>intellectual</b> workshop -- as the first stage of exploring what augmentation might be like. By today's standards, we can demonstrate some impressive features in the workshop environment which we have created to test by our daily use (for doing our daily work). But by our own perspective, as developed through constant struggle in this domain, we have but a primitive outpost on an unbelievably rich frontier. References 1 through 4 describe our work. I invite you to become acquainted, e.g. with Reference <Ref-1>. Copies of the movie (Reference 2 are available; viewing this provides the best introduction to our \"augmented office\".<br><br>It will take the explorers of this domain decades to even map its currently visible dimensions. The real rush hasn't begun: this Conference is a meeting of suppliers looking at the prospector trade; we haven't really been giving attention to the developments that will follow the prospecting.<br><br>My research group is now moving into a next stage of work that we call \"team augmentation\". Here, instead of just the individual facilitating his private domain of searching, studying, thinking and <b>formulating</b>, as his office place provides for him, we are exploring what can be done for a team of \"augmented individuals\" who have in common a number of terminals, a set of computer tools, working files, etc. (as we do) to facilitate their team collaborations.<br><br>Our major initial step toward augmenting a team is to facilitate the collaborative <b>dialogue</b> between its members, aiming for new kinds and degrees of collaboration that can thus be achieved.<br><br></div><div id='full_3'><mark>Collaborative Dialogue<br><br>To discuss our \"Dialogue Support System\", consider a shared-file space.</mark></div><div> </div><div id='full_4'><mark>This is a common enough thing in today's time-shared environment; but our <b>dialogue</b>-file space comprises \"frozen\" contributions from the collaborators -- i.e., it represents the \"Journal\" of transactional entries that make up the collaborative <b>dialogue</b>, entries that are part of the history of things and aren't to be changed.</mark></div><div><br><br>Assume that you are a participant in this <b>dialogue</b>, as from a CRT terminal in your office. You have just contributed some sort of entry into this Journal -- some tentative formulation of a plan or design. You expect some of your collaborators to be interested. You may have installed an \"attention\" signal at entry time, aimed at a particular set of people. At their consoles, they either receive an \"annunciator\" signal to alert them, or may have come across you entry via any number of natural pathways in the course of their work.<br><br>These other people can very quickly and flexibly survey your contribution. At any subsequent time, in any <b>passage</b> of your contribution, one of them can attach a \"comment\" to any specific entity (e.g., word, string of words, paragraph, drawing line or label in the drawing). A comment can be one word (e.g., \"Congratulations!\"), or a reference to a contradictory <b>passage</b>, or a long exhortation about a better way to do the whole thing, other people will be attaching comments at other places, including comments upon other people's comments. What soon evolves from such activity is a network of contributions that represents a full-scale discourse, distributed over time and, if you wish, over space.<br><br>A good \"office-support system\" will provide powerful aids to improve the effectiveness with which one can participate in such a <b>dialogue</b>. For example, one needs speed and flexibility in studying the consequent network of <b>dialogue</b> contributions and in filtering out that which is relevant -- for instance to make a successive version of a plan or design. We are evolving aids for searching through specified sub-nets and selecting upon such attributes as content, previously assigned descriptive tags, authorship, absolute or relative \"publishing\" time, and citation linkages; assembling <b>passage</b>s from the <b>dialogue</b>, and from one's own notes, with flexible disposition of one's screen into \"windows\" for independently viewing different materials; easily affixing new links and tags to arbitrary segments of a given memo; conveniently copying into one's own working file a categorized compilation of extracts. etc.<br><br>One recognizes, of course, that the existing system of professional journals represents a similar mode of <b>dialogue</b>, distributed as it were over space and time. But the computer-aided <b>dialogue</b> has certain advantages to offer: interchanges in cycle times of minutes or seconds instead of years or months; accommodating more items, and items of much smaller size, without overloading the \"clerical system\"; accommodating more people making simultaneous accesses and contributions; providing citation followup to exact items (i.e., the computer can take you almost instantly to look at the particular item cited within another \"document\").<br><br>Within a team that has the kinds of tools and methods that are easily foreseeable, these features are really quite interesting and exciting to consider. We are planning to experiment with this type of collaboration in support of our own system-development activity, within our own shop.<br><br>Office-Sharing and Dialogue in the ARPA Network<br><br>Our Augmentation Research Center, at SRI, is a participating <b>site</b> in ARPA'S experimental computer network (see References 5 and 6). My group is hoping that here the \"augmented office\" approach can be applied to a fuller advantage -- i,e., we hope to see researchers at other <b>site</b>s beginning to use the Office for their work, work other than \"studying and improving the Office\" (which is what my group does). Using our Office system from his home-<b>site</b> CRT terminal, a researcher in computer languages for instance could do the composing, modifying and studying associated with developing his research tools, with setting up and running tests, with integrating the results into his notes, and with communicating and publishing the results.<br><br>His experimental programs and compilations may be run on the computer at his home <b>site</b>, or at other Network <b>site</b>s -- there will be means within the Office making it easy to interface to any special tools and data through the Network. The office is the place where special attention is given to facilitating such supportive <b>intellectual</b> processes as <b>formulating</b> specifications for service requested and for how to present the results and where in the office's records to insert them; there are general needs in this regard over many activities, and the access to all of the special tools being developed in other computer-research areas will be very much heightened if they can be used from an \"office\" where a unified approach was taken to harnessing these tools. Examples: send you analytic formulation to MIT'S Math Lab for processing; Utah's graphic-manipulation processes could construct your illustrations; and the ILLIAC IV can do your heavy computations.<br><br>In this network, my group is slated to serve as the Network Information Center, which role offers new ways to experiment with collaborative <b>dialogue</b>. As we ourselves learn how to deal with it within our \"conjoint office space\", we expect to begin offering use of our \"Dialogue Support System\", through the Network, to people scattered over the country who want to do collaborative things in pursuit of Network activities. For instance, two graduate students from different universities could work closely together on a project, or a professor at one <b>site</b> could serve as a thesis advisor for a graduate student at another <b>site</b>.<br><br>The Knowledge Market<br><br>Here is a brief extrapolation into the future and its Augmented Individuals and Organizations, looking beyond both the ARPA Network and my little experiments with an Augmented Office and a Dialogue Support System. Obviously there will be steadily widening distribution of common-resource accessibility, and a steadily increasing number of people who spend a significant amount of their professional time at terminals. The greater amount and diversity of mutually accessible resources -- human, financial, technological -- will accelerate growth along a number of dimensions. In particular, there will emerge a new \"marketplace\", representing fantastic wealth in commodities of knowledge, service, information, processing, storage, etc. In the number and rage of transactions, and in the speed and flexibility with which they are negotiated, this new market will have a vitality and dynamism as much greater than today's as today's is greater than the <b>village</b> market.<br><br>It seems apparent to me that, following this increased mutual accessibility between knowledge resources and consumers, will be the development of more \"depth\" in the range of both. E.g., just as with the roles of specialty shops and services in some of our industries today, there will be a large number of individuals and small groups each providing highly specialized services. Since their clientele will be drawn from such a large market, they will find a good business even where they serve only a small portion of the market and provide only seldom-needed special services.<br><br>Let's look at a specific \"for instance\". Suppose that one person becomes extremely proficient in making small programs to generate a display or printout to show (particularly well) the status of a multi-task project. He is an independent agent in this multi-access computer network, working at a CRT console in his office at home. Perhaps he specializes in construction projects, and within this perhaps in steelwork erection. You are a management consultant working (from your home) on a short job helping to set up the production-control system for a construction project. When you realized that you might benefit from this kind of help, this is the sequence that takes place:<br><br>Your man is easy enough to find because of computer help in searching for an evaluating special products and services. Suppose that you need something he can do for you with about 45 minutes's effort. You expect immediate accessibility for negotiation -- for instance: it takes you one minute to locate several candidates, two minutes to examine their relative credentials, 20 seconds interrogation of public records to select him as being available right now for your kind of problem, two minutes of personal <b>dialogue</b> to determine for both of you that his capabilities and your needs match, and 15 seconds to negotiate and legalize a contract. He does his job in 40 minutes, and spends five more minutes transferring the results to you (with <b>dialogue</b>).<br><br>He switches back immediately to a task sequence whose contract arrangement had permitted him such interruptions. In working on this job, you have been \"time-shared\" with several other jobs having higher priority, and several that were running \"background\". During the forty minutes he was off doing his thing for you, your higher-priority task sequences took you off on other pursuits. In fact, when he was done, you weren't ready to get back to him for twenty-three minutes, but the mutual-scheduling algorithm agreed upon in your contract took care of connecting you and him, when you were both ready, for your final <b>dialogue</b>.<br><br>Your <b>dialogue</b>, of course, comprised both voice and shared computer graphics. Your mutually viewed display could be flipped back and forth between views of what he called forth on his end to show you, and what you provided to show him. As you were showing him your work domain, he was \"catching\" reference links into the specific items that he might later need to get at, entering quick notes on some of them.<br><br>The whole <b>dialogue</b> was recorded, as a matter of course and for either of you to use later. The stored <b>speech</b> was digitized, and automatically segmented into the alternate <b>passage</b>s of your exchange. </div><div id='full_1'><mark>During your <b>dialogue</b>, whenever one of you referred to a displayed item in your <b>speech</b>, your practice was to make an explicit screen-select action in association with the spoken reference term (e.g., with a \"that line\" or \"both of these figures\" expression), so that when any given <b>passage</b> might later be selected for \"playback\", the computer could re-create for you the image you were seeing and indicate the displayed entity being referenced.</mark></div><div><br><br>Some of the <b>dialogue</b> had stimulating and instructive contents for you, You wanted to save these and integrate them into your personal notes. </div><div id='full_0'><mark>Citations to this <b>dialogue</b> are easy to install in your notes, including citations to a <b>speech</b> <b>passage</b> -- where, upon later seeing such a citation and \"calling for\" the item it refers to, the associated bit string would be found and the <b>speech</b> <b>passage</b> played back for you.</mark></div><div><br><br>Perhaps you consider some of the <b>speech</b> <b>passage</b>s to be useful enough to have them transcribed into text. A quick designation of your desire causes these <b>speech</b> strings to be transmitted to a service you customarily use for doing you transcription. This service harnesses the latest <b>speech</b>-recognition computer aids, implemented with special-purpose hardware and software, and includes skilled clerical staff who supplement the 98% capability of the machine. Your two-minute transcription job is scheduled through their served units quite automatically, and the text strings are routed back and inserted in their appropriate places without your further attention. You have established the convention with the service agency that un-decipherable or dubious <b>passage</b>s will be tagged, and if you had wanted to you could have designated when you sent the job off that you wanted to be interrupted to resolve such when the material returned.<br><br>When you and your contractor parted ways, you each might exercise an optional procedure which helps you record your impressions of the other. An important part of your value within this marketplace rests upon your ability to integrate effectively the skills and knowledge of others. So you pay careful attention both to your \"intelligence\" base which helps you keep track of appropriate people, and to conducting your negotiations and working relationships with an eye for doing well by the other guy -- because he too probably keeps an effective intelligence system and it might well be important to you later that he (or his friends) feels good about working with you. You also need to assess his potential value to you for other and different collaboration.<br><br>It is recognized rather widely that computer networks raise significant problems about the privacy of closed information. The other side of the coin is that computer networks raise rather remarkable opportunities to benefit from the sharing of open information. I am quite convinced that there is very high value to be derived within the Computer-Network Knowledge Market from a degree of openness with what have heretofore been considered as private types of information.<br><br>Among the members of a working team, this could mean keeping open as a matter of course all of their scratch notes, trial designs, etc. to their colleagues, and expecting them to browse, comment, etc. Once this is the standard operating mode, those aspects of a person's <b>vulnerability</b> that depend mainly upon another's lack of understanding and compassion begin to find a compensating safeguard in the fact that hurtful actions taken therefrom by another person tend also to have complete visibility. This visibility, plus long-lasting availability of notes and records, would be important to the processes by which each person evaluates his potential colleagues -- which soon becomes important to those concerned with personal growth within this market, and moves toward a lower significance otherwise hurtful actions attempted by those without mature concern for their own growth, or without ability to grow into or stay in a position where their comments and actions are trusted or seriously considered.<br><br>This may seem unduly naive, I know. But then consider an Afghanistanian <b>village</b>r, whose entire worldly experience is with a primitive every-man-for-himself market: what might it sound like to him to hear a peer suggest that the marketplace would benefit hugely by operating upon the basis of trusting the other man's word. \"I say that I will pay you next week for a dozen buns, and I walk away without counting how many buns you put into the bag.\" Unreal fantasy -- talk of credit accounts, checking accounts, credit ratings, credit cards, etc. What does this have to do with getting the best price for my goat, to deal with abstractions such as accounts, promises to honor, reputation, etc. in a formalized, recorded fashion? Ludicrous restrictions and dangerous <b>vulnerability</b> for a system to expect both me and my neighbor (adversary) to reveal our positions, stand behind the things we say and the marks we make, and depend upon the other to do so.<br><br>It seems clear that today's Western-world economy couldn't be as strong as it is if such open <b>vulnerability</b> didn't prevail. I only wish that I knew the evolutionary dynamics that produced the <b>attitudes</b> and customs necessary to make the \"honest openness\" work -- obviously its practice in the Afghanistanian <b>village</b> would lead to disaster, and yet it likely was from just such a market environment that ours evolved.<br><br>It seems not unreasonable to assume that survival value in our cultural evolution will favor institutions which support the most efficient Knowledge Markets (organisms which support the most efficient <b>nervous</b> systems). Then certainly the Knowledge Market will someday operate with more open trust in its knowledge interchange, to release for constructive ends a great deal of otherwise entrapped human energy. Those who grow up within such an environment will look back with pity upon the primitive fears and protective practices prevailing in 1970.<br><br>Summary<br><br>I think that tomorrow's institutions can be (must be) far better adapted to their environment, much better at providing for a full life style for everyone. These changes require a very significant increase in the institutions' ability to develop, support, and integrate the <b>intellectual</b> power of their individuals and organizations. And, as I see it, this ability will be directly dependent upon advanced application of interactive computers and multi-access computer networks. But the following condition is very strong in this \"implications\" picture: to harness this technology toward these ends will require intense concurrent development of our very complex and sophisticated system of concepts, conventions, methods, skills, organizational forms, <b>attitudes</b>, and values. It is time, and the means are at hand, to develop a much improved <b>nervous</b> system for our \"social organisms\".</div>",

Engelbart<br>Stanford Research Institute<br><br>Introduction<br><br>Generally, adoption of a multi-access computer network is promoted on the basis of increased accessibility and economy of computational and data-bank resources for a <b>distributed</b> <b>community</b> of users. But visualize this resource-sharing computer network as a general-purpose digital-packet transportation system linking resources, processors, vendors, brokers, customers, etc.; then consider that the existence of such a transportation system will inevitably stimulate growth of an information market involving many processes, products, and <b>services</b>. A <b>distributed</b> <b>community</b> availing itself of such a transportation system should rightfully count on such market development for much of its payoff from its early investment.<br><br>In particular, the \"Knowledge Workshop\" <b>services</b> described below will grow to become very important to network-coupled communities that are involved with a common discipline or mission -- my judgement is that this use of computer networks will come to dominate over the purely computational use in scale and generally perceived social worth, with today's type of computer <b>services</b> being seen as but a special subset of the tools integrated into a coherent <b>knowledge</b> <b>workshop</b>.<br><br>The Knowledge Workshop<br><br>In using the term \"<b>knowledge</b> <b>workshop</b>\", I build directly upon terms \"<b>knowledge</b> work\" and \"<b>knowledge</b> worker\", whose special use I first came across in reading Peter Drucker (Ref-1). He develops a much larger theme about these concepts in Ref-2, adding terms such as \"<b>knowledge</b> technologies\", \"<b>knowledge</b> economy\", and \"<b>knowledge</b> society\", and pointing out that the growing level and importance of <b>knowledge</b>-work activity in our society will produce a discontinuity in our cultural evolution of a scale commensurate with that of the industrial revolution.<br><br>The <b>knowledge</b> <b>workshop</b> is the specially provided environment in which <b>knowledge</b> workers do their <b>knowledge</b> work. We can talk about a small <b>knowledge</b> <b>workshop</b> for an individual, or a large <b>knowledge</b> <b>workshop</b> for an organization. Knowledge <b>workshop</b>s have existed for centuries, but here we consider maximizing their effectiveness by systematically evolving tools, methods, etc., with heavy dependence upon the new technologies of computer time sharing and networking. (In the text below, read \"<b>knowledge</b> <b>workshop</b>\" for \"Workshop\".)<br><br>Basic <b>workshop</b> functions must serve the daily handling of the users' working information -- of their notes, things-to-do lists, memos, letters, designs, plans, budgets, announcements, commentary, proposals, reports, programs, documentation, item-control catalogs, etc. And before it can sensibly be of much value, we believe that a Workshop has to provide for the grubby cut-and-try detail involved in the minute-by-minute, day-after-day worker's handling of this information: in its composition, studying, commenting upon, arguing about, modifying, communicating, publishing, presenting, etc. There are many exciting, elegant tools in the offing -- superlative graphics, artificial-intelligence <b>services</b>, etc. -- but their serious application will only be sensible within an integrated Workshop, and in a manner whose associated conceptual and procedural skills are consistent with those of tools and techniques that <b>support</b> the basic Workshop functions.<br><br>For the past ten years in the Augmentation Research Center (ARC), at Stanford Research Institute, we have concentrated in succession on exploring the computer augmentation of <b>knowledge</b> <b>workshop</b>s, first for an individual, then as extended for a project team, and then for a network-coupled, <b>distributed</b> <b>community</b> (See Ref-3). Over the past three years we have developed a beginning set of prototype \"<b>community</b>-Workshop\" <b>services</b> on the ARPANET, as associated with our serving as the Network Information Center (NIC).*<br><br>[Footnote] *The following agencies have contributed components of direct <b>support</b> to this ten-year development: The Information Processing Techniques Office (ARPA), Langley Research Center (NASA), Rome Air Development Center (USAF), and the Information Systems Branch (ONR).<br><br>Our focus all along has been toward <b>support</b>ing R&D workers, and we have followed the empirical, bootstrapping approach of doing as much of our own work as possible in our Workshop, continuously building, using, and evolving it. Our Workshop <b>services</b> are supplied by a large software system that we call NLS, running under TENEX on a PDP-10. It provides a large repertoire of functions to display terminals (DNLS), <b>online</b> typewriter terminals (TNLS), or via deferred-execution of commands and text from offline typewriters as accumulated on cassettes or other intermediate storage (DEX). Hardcopy output is available on typewriters, <b>online</b> printers, or through an offline phototypesetting device providing publication-grade quality for multi-font text, computer-directed graphic constructs, or scan-stored diagrams.<br><br>Besides giving constant, pragmatic attention to the needs and possibilities for evolution of <b>support</b> functions and working methods, we have had to struggle with what is a soul-wrenching burden for people whose orientation is toward exploratory development -- trying to meet the absolutely necessary requirements of organizing, documenting, maintaining, and operating the hardware/software and clerical <b>services</b> towards being responsive and reliable, minute after minute and day after day.<br><br></div><div id='full_0'><mark>Technology has reached a state warranting much more activity explicitly applied toward the evolution both of better Workshops, and of a coherent discipline associated with Workshop-system development; for this to happen, it is obvious that more people must take on the challenge of becoming \"Workshop architects\", and that more pilot-plant Workshops need to be set up for exploratory <b>support</b> of real <b>knowledge</b>-work activities.</mark></div><div> </div><div id='full_4'><mark>There are (will be many) approaches to be tried besides ours, of course; but to do our bit toward accellerating this process, we intend to share and extend our developments and <b>knowledge</b> by making our Workshop tools available for exploratory application in <b>distributed</b>, modular, pilot-Workshop sites, and by offering close collaboration with the pilot-Workshop architects.</mark></div><div> (Note below that an important Workshop feature being offered is designed to facilitate such \"<b>distributed</b> collaboration\".)<br><br></div><div id='full_3'><mark>Prototype Community-Workshop Support<br><br>We aren't ignoring exploratory use within localized organizations, but we are committing a substantial portion of our energy toward the early, exploratory use of <b>knowledge</b>-<b>workshop</b> <b>services</b> to <b>support</b> <b>distributed</b>, network-coupled communities.</mark></div><div> There are two special reasons for this commitment:<br><br>The first reason concerns relative payoff: if a service facilitates hobnobbing via terminals, there is extra value when this supplants air fare and a two-day trip in contrast with supplanting a walk down the hall; there is more payoff from relatively costly augmentation <b>services</b> when they facilitate collaboration among participants who are <b>distributed</b> rather than among those who are already clustered.<br><br>The second reason concerns a wider awareness of the possibilities for augmenting <b>knowledge</b> <b>workshop</b>s, and a wider interest and involvement in their accelerated evolution -- things we hope to enhance by facilitating <b>community</b>-Workshop exploration. We find that toward significant Workshop innovations a user needs a sort of warming-up process before gracefully giving something new a try. Thereafter, in the right environment, he will \"naturally\" adopt successive stages of significant new Workshop techniques. This process is noticeably facilitated by steady exposure to the products and conventions of Workshop <b>services</b>; and it helps considerably to have a variety of opportunities and materials to stimulate and <b>support</b> the \"giving it a try\" -- for instance, to try a little <b>online</b> <b>dialogue</b> with a distant, more-advanced colleague, dealing with materials already in the <b>community</b> data base. Also, if a new stage of service is available in this \"<b>community</b> way\", a large number of people will benefit from the lower threshold of investment and determination needed to give it a try.<br><br>Following is a brief description of <b>community</b>-Workshop applications that special communities can consider exploring. The sequence represents an explicit progression, beginning with tested techniques whose \"cultural shock\" and financial investment are relatively low, and offering paced, open-ended evolution with time, experience, and perceived payoff. We are arranging for computer <b>support</b> of these <b>services</b> by a commercial-quality \"utility\" service connected to the ARPANET. We will provide this Workshop <b>support</b> (at cost) over the Network to selected subscribers for setting up and exploring prototype, augmented-Workshop applications. We expect the Workshop toolkit to be continually expanding and improving, and plan for much of the evolutionary energy and direction to come from the subscribers.<br><br>Collaborative Dialogue: We offer computer aids for the composition of messages and for their subsequent reviewing, cross-referencing, modification, transmission, storage, indexing, and full-text retrieving. A \"message\" may be one word in length, or a hundred printed pages. In any message there may be formalized citations pointing to specific passages in prior messages, so that a group of related messages becomes a network of recorded-<b>dialogue</b> contributions. There is also: automatic delivery of messages; full cataloging and indexing; <b>online</b> accessibility both to message notification and to the full text of all messages; and open-ended storage of the <b>dialogue</b> records. These <b>services</b> enable a <b>community</b> of people who are <b>distributed</b> in space and time to maintain recorded, collaborative <b>dialogue</b> at a new degree of effectiveness.<br><br>Then to <b>support</b> \"real-time\" remote <b>dialogue</b> (teleconferencing), we have the following facility: Any two DNLS users can \"link up\" at any time, so that each party sees a common display view, including both his and the other person's cursor; either party is able to point or control, and they mutually have access to the full range of Workshop functions, over any of the <b>online</b> information. The responsiveness and bandwidth of the ARPANET provide remarkably good <b>support</b> of our highly interactive DNLS service to remote display users, so that when used to supplement a telephone conversation, the speed and flexibility of this shared, \"augmented <b>blackboard</b>\" brings a new quality to teleconferencing that is really quite dramatic.<br><br>Document Development, Production, And Control: We offer a rich set of computer aids for the composition, study, and modification of document drafts, and for automatically generating high-quality photocomposition output with flexible controls for font-designation and formatting, to enable the production of publication-grade hardcopy (printing masters, or microform masters). There are processes for collaboration between several writers, and with an editor, in the process of evolving a final draft. Included among such helpers can be experienced production people to help in laying out a finished document, in inserting proper designations for specifying font, size, and density of different character strings, and for managing footnotes, cross-references, tables of contents, indices, etc. There are also aids for the people who must keep control of changes, new-version distributions, etc., and provide the indexing to complex documents or sets of documents. Planned improvements include facility for handling complex graphic portrayals and extensive special symbols.<br><br>Research Intelligence: The provisions within the Dialogue Support System for cataloguing and indexing internally generated items also <b>support</b> the management of externally generated items -- bibliography, contact reports, clippings, notes, etc. With these centrally supplied (therefore uniformly available) <b>services</b>, a <b>community</b> can maintain a dynamic and highly useful \"intelligence\" data base to help it keep up to date on external happenings that particularly affect it. Microform distribution can provide for mass replication of this data base at remote sites, and computer-generated indexes or <b>online</b> retrieval can facilitate access. Citations of external items from within the internally-generated <b>dialogue</b> base -- in the form of annotations, miscellaneous commentary, or <b>support</b>ive references -- offer computer-sensible interlinking of the external information with the internal, and considerably facilitate browsing, retrieval, back-citation searching, etc.<br><br>The Community could choose to operate a special Information Analysis and Integration Center as a nucleus to this activity, but the notes and private-collection records of individual users, integrated into the \"recorded <b>dialogue</b>\", could well add the more value. (Ref-4 describes some developments and possibilities for <b>support</b> of research intelligence.)<br><br>Community Handbook Development: We are extending the above <b>services</b> toward the coordinated handling of a very large and complex body of documentation and its associated external references. I use the term \"superdocument\" to refer to such material when integrated into a monolithic whole. There are a number of important applications for a system that facilitates the responsive development and evolution of a superdocument by many (<b>distributed</b>) individuals. In particular, for either a discipline- or project-oriented <b>community</b>, one very important application of a centrally available \"superdocumentation\" service would be to maintain \"The Community Handbook\" -- i.e., a uniform, complete, consistent, up-to-date integration of the special <b>knowledge</b> representing the current status of the Community.<br><br>The Handbook would include: principles, working hypotheses, practices, special-term glossaries, standards, goals, goal status, <b>support</b>ive arguments, techniques, observations, how-to-do-it items, etc. An active <b>community</b> would be constantly involved in <b>dialogue</b> bearing upon the contents of the last formal version of its Handbook -- comments, errata, suggestions, challenges, counter examples, altered designs, improved arguments, new experimental techniqes and data, etc. Constant updating would provide a \"certified, <b>community</b> position structure\" about which the real evolutionary work would swarm; flexible aids for <b>online</b> \"navigation and view generation\" would be very important, as would the facility for automatic publication (especially into microform editions).<br><br>Computer-Based Instruction: If relatively widespread applicability of Computer-Based Instruction (CBI) were suitable for the Community, then there would likely be advantage gained from pooling resources and utilizing a <b>community</b>-coordinated instructional service. For a <b>community</b> also utilizing other centrally managed Workshop <b>services</b> of the scope and power described here, there would be considerable overlap between them and their CBI processes and activities.<br><br>Even though CBI has more visibility and momentum as a discipline than does CBKW (Computer-Based Knowledge Workshop), it seems inevitable that the former will end up as being but a special, integrated component of the latter. One should expect CBI service anyway in his Workshop, and he won't expect to go to a different terminal or to learn a different set of interactive concepts and skills to get that service; and also, that service will often bear directly upon concepts and matters deeply embedded in the workaday domain of his Workshop system.<br><br>It is also very probable (to my mind) that communities will ultimately integrate their Handbook and CBI techniques so that their monolithic, superdocument Handbook would contain the special tags, links and etc. required by the CBI computer processes so that a significant portion of the instructional <b>services</b> would be generated directly from the primary <b>knowledge</b> source, the Community Handbook.<br><br>Meetings and Conferences: This refers to assemblies of people, which occurrences aren't likely for a long time yet to be supplanted in total effect by technological aids. In <b>support</b>ing our own ARC meetings, demonstrations, etc., we use TV-projector equipment that projects our regular work-terminal display images onto a movie screen, easily readable in a meeting room having enough ambient light for comfortably reading notes and seeing each other. Images from live TV-cameras or from video recorders can also be projected. We make use of commercial devices for controlling these various video signals -- switching, mixing, and frame-splitting. We can mix two signals to get image superposition, or split the video frame to get a computer-display picture on one part of the screen and a camera image on the other (for example, simultaneously showing the camera view of the user's controlling actions right along with the display responses from the computer).<br><br>With this projector setup, we use our regular Workshop techniques in meetings to present and explain material from the <b>online</b> data base. It is easy to review and change the agenda and the meeting notes; some meetings operate very profitably in a mode of \"collaborative position-statement development\", with a facility that for many purposes is far superior to using a <b>blackboard</b> -- it is as though the <b>blackboard</b> now is very easily stretched to make room for new notes, edited, scrolled, folded, reorganized, or etc., and any available <b>online</b> material may be copied onto it for integration into the study, re-organization, re-wording, development process. A skilled Workshop user can operate this \"<b>blackboard</b>\" with enough speed and flexibility that these processes often don't seem to be what limits group progress (in the midst of questions, deliberations, etc.).<br><br>Any Workshop user at the gathering can call on part of his own <b>online</b> notes, or use his familiarity with certain material, to bring special information before the assembly. Or, the whole assembly can see the display being controlled by another individual (or assembly) at a remote site, in shared-display <b>dialogue</b>. There are many further technical and procedural innovations to explore in improving the effectiveness of meetings -- e.g. computer-processed bio-feedback, radical changes in the \"rules of order\", and giving each participant independent use of a private display terminal.<br><br>Community Management and Organization: Where the Community has conventional, project-management operations, their Workshop can include computer aids for such as PERT and CPM, plus the enriching <b>services</b> of <b>dialogue</b> <b>support</b>, document development, and a \"Handbook\" system. An extension of the Handbook could contain plans, commitments, schedules, specifications, current-state records of work in progress, etc., with special Workshop tools to <b>support</b> management analysis and control.<br><br>But also, with the probable increase in the amount and intensity of <b>distributed</b> collaboration within the Community, \"committee work\" would become more widespread, dynamic, and important. Thus there would be greater dependence upon better techniques for inter-communication and management within the committee-like structures by which a Community goes about its composite business. Harnessing these new techniques will lead to very different ways in which <b>distributed</b> communities can be organized and in which they can go about their business -- and the possibility of considerable improvement here, stemming from relatively modest innovative investments, is an important part of our motivation toward facilitating Community Workshop exploration.<br><br>Special Knowledge Work by Individuals and Teams: Assumedly, Community members could avail themselves of the above types of Workshop service in <b>support</b> of their own daily work -- i.e., for other than their participating in <b>community</b>-oriented activities. There are obvious benefits to almost any <b>knowledge</b> worker from use of general Workshop facilities such as listed above; and for a team (or any close-working organizational unit) of augmented <b>knowledge</b> workers, there is yet another level of benefit to be gained by adopting new organizational structure and collaborative methods that harness better the new capabilities existing within the Workshop (as extended by a few special team-<b>support</b> tools).<br><br>Then further, the particular set of disciplines and pursuits which characterize the Community will generally have special computer-based processes and data that are important in its work -- i.e. unique functions and forms in its analytical programs, statistical processes, numerical data, conceptual/analytic models, graphic portrayals of subject matter, etc. Assuming that they are available within the same computer network that distributes the Community's Workshop-<b>support</b> <b>services</b>, then access to these special computer-based resources can be provided to a worker \"through\" the coordinated Workshop in which he does his other work -- and to a distinct advantage.<br><br>In any of this special work, there is basic advantage in having a flexible, powerful facility for managing mixed text and graphics -- composing, studying, modifying, integrating new material into working notes and reports, publishing, doing collaborative <b>dialogue</b>, giving presentations, etc. When doing tasks of this sort in assocation with his special computer-based operations, it is an important advantage to the worker to do so within a familiar and consistent working environment. </div><div id='full_1'><mark>Our Workshop flexibly provides for special translation of information passing back and forth to any such \"external\" computer service, so that for access to a wide variety of such <b>services</b> the Workshop can provide users with consistent conventions and methods in whose use his other Workshop tools would be of maximum <b>support</b>.</mark></div><div><br><br>Conclusion<br><br>The full sense of what computer networks offer in the way of \"resource sharing\" contains some special twists of significance here: For one thing, a truly complete Workshop will contain a very large repertoire of service functions, and the evolution, operation, and maintenance of these functions (and their <b>support</b> software) will require highly trained specialists. Any sort of widespread exploration of augmented-Workshop techniques will be very much facilitated by the network's capability for sharing the expertise of such specialists -- by enabling central computational resources that they develop and maintain to service <b>distributed</b> users. Note that specialists working from their home Workshop will be able to reach through the network to install and maintain software in remote hardware installations, which will be important, too; but note also that many already-present local computers and operating systems are inappropriate for <b>support</b>ing all of the important Workshop functions.<br><br>For another thing, the vocabulary and procedural skill required to harness these functions effectively and smoothly into one's worklife will become very extensive and sophisticated (the pidgin-English approach won't provide the power, and full-statement natural language isn't fast enough), and again special expertise will be necessary to help people through the learning stages as their Workshop matures. </div><div id='full_2'><mark>Therefore, although the network can very much facilitate bringing into user reach these powerful Workshop tools, it requires the additional network-<b>support</b>ed (Workshop) facilities such as teleconferencing to enable a limited number of Workshop specialists to give close <b>support</b> to these learning processes, without which the computer <b>services</b> would have much less value.</mark></div><div><br><br>If exploration of Workshop use were to occur only where there exists both an appropriate local computer system and trained specialists to maintain the software and train the users, there would be a very much slower evolution toward the increased-effectiveness possibilities offered by computer augmentation.<br><br>Finally, the \"digital-packet transportation system\" aspect of a computer network seems quite essential to the practical, effective <b>support</b> of an augmented Community Knowledge Workshop -- which in turn seems to offer a really important and unique means for sharing among a <b>community</b> of humans the <b>distributed</b> nuclei of human resources represented by individuals with special <b>knowledge</b>, judgement, intuition, imagination, conceptual skills, etc. This human-resource sharing has explosive potential -- I look to it with a biological metaphor as providing a new evolutionary stage for the nervous system of social organisms, from which much more highly developed institutional forms may evolve that are much improved in: awareness of self and environment, situational cognizance and response, visualization of the future, problem-solving capability, etc. (See Ref-5 for expansion of this theme.)</div>",

ENGELBART <br>14-MAR-73 17:15 (AUGMENT,13851,)<br><br><br>INTRODUCTION<br><br>The theme of this paper ties directly to that developed in a concurrent paper \"The Augmented Knowledge Workshop,\" [1], and assumes that: \"intelligent <b>terminals</b>\" will come to be used very, very extensively by knowledge workers of all kinds; <b>terminals</b> will be their constant working companions; service transactions through their <b>terminals</b> will cover a surprisingly pervasive range of work activity, including communication with people who are widely distributed geographically; the many \"computer-aid tools\" and human services thus accessible will represent a thoroughly coordinated \"knowledge workshop\"; most of these users will absorb a great deal of special training aimed at effectively harnessing their respective workshop systems -- in special working methods, conventions, concepts, and procedural and operating skills.<br><br></div><div id='full_0'><mark>Within the Augmentation Rese<b>arc</b>h Center (ARC), we have ten years of concentrated experience in developing and using terminal systems whose evolution has been explicitly oriented toward such a future environment; from this background, two special topics are developed in this paper:<br><br>What we (at ARC) have learned about controlling interactive-display services, and the means we have evolved for doing it -- the particular devices (<b>mouse</b>, <b>keyset</b>, keyboard), feedback, and protocol/skill features; and design data, usage techniques, learnability experience, and relevant needs and possibilities for alternatives and extensions.</mark></div><div><br><br>Our considerations and attitudes regarding the distribution of functions between terminal and remote/shared resources -- including assumptions about future-terminal service needs, our networking experience, and foreseen trends in the associated technologies.<br><br>The references [2-19] include considerable explicit description of developments, principles, and usage (text, photos, and movies) to support the following discussion. Annotation is included, not only to provide a guide for selective follow up, but also to supplement the substance to the body of the paper by the nature of the commentary.<br><br><br>CONTROL MEANS <br><br>Introduction<br><br>Our particular system of devices, conventions, and command-protocol evolved with particular requirements: we assumed, for instance, that we were aiming for a workshop in which these very basic operations of designating and executing commands would be used constantly, over and over and over again, during hour-after-hour involvement, within a shifting succession of operations supporting a wide range of tasks, and with eventual command vocabularies that would become very large.<br><br>The Mouse for Display Selection<br><br>During 1964-65 we experimented with various approaches to the screen selection problem for interactive display work within the foregoing framework. The tests [6,7] involved a number of devices, including the best light pen we could buy, a joy stick, and even a knee control that we lashed together. To complete the range of devices, we implemented an older idea, what became known as our \"<b>mouse</b>,\" that came through the experiments ahead of all of its competitors and has been our standard device for eight years now.<br><br>The tests were computerized, and measured speed and accuracy of selection under several conditions. We included measurement of the \"transfer time\" involved when a user transferred his mode of action from screen selection with one hand to keyboard typing with both hands; surprisingly, this proved to be one of the more important aspects in choosing one device over another.<br><br>The nature of the working environment diminished the relative attractiveness of a light pen, for instance, because of fatigue factors and the frustrating difficulty in constantly picking up and putting down the pen as the user intermixed display selections with other operations.<br><br>The <b>mouse</b> is a screen-selection device that we developed in 1964 to fill a gap in the range of devices that we were testing. It is of palm-filling size, has a flexible cord attached, and is operated by moving it over a suitable hard surface that has no other function than to generate the proper mixture of rolling and sliding motions for each of the two orthogonally oriented disk wheels that comprise two of the three support points.<br><br>Potentiometers coupled to the wheels produce signals that the computer uses directly for X-Y positioning of the display cursor. It is an odd-seeming phemomenon, but each wheel tends to do the proper mix of rolling and sideways sliding so that, as the <b>mouse</b> is moved, the wheel's net rotation closely matches the component of <b>mouse</b> movement in the wheel's \"rolling\" direction; one wheel controls up-down and the other left-right cursor motion.<br><br>Exactly the same phenomenon, applied in the mechanical integrators of old-fashioned differential analyzers, was developed to a high degree of accuracy in resolving the translation components; we borrowed the idea, but we don't try to match the precision. Imperfect mapping of the <b>mouse</b>-movement trajectory by the cursor is of no concern to the user when his purpose is only to \"control\" the position of the cursor; we have seen people adapt unknowingly to accidental situations where that mapping required them to move the <b>mouse</b> along an <b>arc</b> in order to move the cursor in a straight line.<br><br>That the <b>mouse</b> beat out its competitors, in our tests and for our application conditions, seemed to be based upon small factors: it stays put when your hand leaves it to do something else (type, or move a paper), and re-accessing proves quick and free from fumbling. Also, it allows you to shift your posture easily, which is important during long work sessions with changing types and modes of work. And it doesn't require a special and hard-to-move work surface, as many tablets do. A practiced, intently involved worker can be observed using his <b>mouse</b> effectively when its movement area is littered with an amazing assortment of papers, pens, and coffee cups, somehow running right over some of it and working around the rest.<br><br>One-Handed, Chording Keyset as Universal \"Function\" Keyboard<br><br>For our application purposes, one-handed function keyboards providing indvidual <b>buttons</b> for special commands were considered to be too limited in the range of command signals they provided. The one-handed \"function keyboard\" we chose was one having five piano-like keys upon which the user strikes <b>chords</b>; of the thirty-one possible <b>chords</b>, twenty six represent the letters of the alphabet. One is free to design any sort of alphabetic-sequence command language he wishes, and the user is free to enter them through either his standard (typewriter-like) keyboard or his <b>keyset</b>.<br><br>The range of <b>keyset</b>-entry options is extended by co-operative use of three control <b>buttons</b> on the <b>mouse</b>. Their operation by the <b>mouse</b>-moving hand is relatively independent of the simultaneous pointing action going on. We have come to use all seven of the \"chording\" combinations, and for several of these, the effect is different if while they are depressed there are characters entered -- e.g. </div><div id='full_2'><mark>(<b>buttons</b> are number 1 to 3, right to left) Button 2 Down-Up effects a command abort, while \"Button 2 Down, <b>keyset</b> entry, Button 2 Up\" does not abort the command but causes the computer to interpret the interim entry <b>chords</b> as upper case letters.</mark></div><div><br><br>These different \"chord-interpretation cases\" are shown in the table of Appendix A; Buttons 2 and 3 are used effectively to add two bits to the chording codes, and we use three of these \"shift cases\" to represent the characters available on our typewriter keyboard, and the fourth for special, view-specification control. (\"View specification\" is described in [1].)<br><br></div><div id='full_1'><mark>Learning of Cases 1 and 2 is remarkably easy, and a user with but a few hours practice gains direct operational value from <b>keyset</b> use; as his skill steadily (and naturally) grows, he will come to do much of his work with one hand on the <b>mouse</b> and the other on the <b>keyset</b>, entering short literal strings as well as command mnemonics with the <b>keyset</b>, and shifting to the typewriter keyboard only for the entry of longer literals.</mark></div><div><br><br>The <b>keyset</b> is not as fast as the keyboard for continuous text entry; its unique value stems from the two features of (a) being a one-handed device, and (b) never requiring the user's eyes to leave the screen in order to access and use it. The matter of using control devices that require minimum shift of eye attention from the screen during their use (including transferring hands from one device to another), is an important factor in designing display consoles where true proficiency is sought. This has proven to be an important feature of the <b>mouse</b>, too.<br><br>It might be mentioned that systematic study of the micro-procedures involved in controlling a computer at a terminal needs to be given more attention. Its results could give much support to the designer. Simple analyses, for instance, have shown us that for any of the screen selection devices, a single selection operation \"costs\" about as much in entry-information terms as the equivalent of from three to six character strokes on the <b>keyset</b>. In many cases, much less information than that would be sufficient to designate a given displayed entity.<br><br>Such considerations long ago led us to turn away completely from \"light button\" schemes, where selection actions are used to designate control or information entry. It is rare that more than 26 choices are displayed, so that if an alphabetic \"key\" character were displayed next to each such \"button,\" it would require but one stroke on the <b>keyset</b> to provide input designation equivalent to a screen-selection action. Toward such tradeoffs, it even seems possible to me that a keyboard-oriented scheme could be designed for selection of text entities from the display screen, in which a skilled typist would keep his hands on keyboard and his eyes on the screen at all times, where speed and accuracy might be better than for <b>mouse</b>-<b>keyset</b> combination.<br><br>NOTE: For those who would like to obtain some of these devices for their own use, a direct request to us is invited. William English, who did the key engineering on successive versions leading to our current models of <b>mouse</b> and <b>keyset</b> is now experimenting with more advanced designs at the Palo Alto Rese<b>arc</b>h Center (PARC) of Xerox, and has agreed to communicate with especially interested parties.<br><br>Language, Skills and Training<br><br>I believe that concern with the \"easy-to-learn\" aspect of user-oriented application systems has often been wrongly emphasized. For control of functions that are done very frequently, payoff in higher efficiency warrants the extra training costs associated with using a sophisticated command vocabulary, including highly abbreviated (therefore non-mnemonic) command terms. and requiring mastery of challenging operating skills. There won't be any easy way to harness as much power as is offered, for closely supporting one's constant, daily knowledge work, without using sophisticated special languages. Special computer-interaction languages will be consciously developed, for all types of serious knowledge workers, whose mastery will represent a significant investment, like years of special training.<br><br>I invite interested skeptics to view a movie that we have available for loan [13], for a visual demonstration of flexibility and speed that could not be achieved with primitive vocabularies and operating skills that required but a few minutes (or hours even) to learn. No one seriously expects a person to be able to learn how to operate an automobile, master all of the rules of the road, familiarize himself with navigation techniques and safe-driving tactics, with little or no investment in learning and training.<br><br><br>SERVICE NETWORK<br><br>One's terminal will provide him with many services. Essential among these will be those involving communication with remote resources, including people. His terminal therefore must be part of a communication network. Advances in communicatiion technology will provide very efficient transportation of digital packets, routed and transhipped in ways enabling very high interaction rates between any two points. At various nodes of such a network will be located different components of the network's processing and storage functions.<br><br>The best distribution of these functions among the nodes will depend upon a balance between factors of usage, relative technological progress, sharability, privacy, etc. Each of these is bound to begin evolving at a high rate, so that it seems pointless to argue about it now; that there will be value in having a certain amount of local processor capability at the terminal seems obvious, as for instance to handle the special communication interface mentioned above.<br><br><br>EXTENDED FEATURES<br><br>I have developed some concepts and models in the past that are relevant here, see especially [5]. A model of computer-aided communication has particular interest for me; I described a \"Computer-Aided Human-Communication Subsystem,\" with a schematic showing symmetrical sets of processes, human and equipment, that serve in the two paths of a feedback loop between the central computer-communication processes and the human's central processes, from which control and information want to flow and to which understanding and feedback need to flow.<br><br>There are the human processes of encoding, decoding, output <b>transducing</b> (motor actions), and input <b>transducing</b> (sensory actions), and a complementary set of processes for the technological interface: physical transducers that match input and output signal forms to suit the human, and coding/decoding processes to translate between these signal forms in providing I/O to the main communication and computer processes.<br><br>In Reference [5], different modes of currently used human communcation were discussed in the framework of this model. It derived some immediate possibilities (e.g., chord <b>keyset</b>s), and predicted that there will ultimately be a good deal of profitable rese<b>arc</b>h in this area. It is very likely that there exist different signal forms that people can better harness than they do today's hand motions or vocal productions, and that a matching technology will enable new ways for the humans to encode their signals, to result in significant improvements in the speed, precision, flexibility, etc. with which an augmented human can control service processes and communicate with his world.<br><br>It is only an accident that the particular physical signals we use have evolved as they have -- the evolutionary environment strongly affected the outcome; but the computer's interface-matching capability opens a much wider domain and provides a much different evolutionary environment within which the modes of human communication will evolve in the future.<br><br>As these new modes evolve, it is likely that the transducers and the encoding/decoding processes will be built into the local terminal. This is one support requirement that is likely to be met by the terminal rather than by remote nodes.<br><br>To me there is value in considering what I call \"The User-System, Service-System Dichotomy\" (also discussed in [5]). The terminal is at the interface between these two \"systems,\" and unfortunately, the technologists who develop the service system on the mechanical side of the terminal have had much too limited a view of the user system on the human side of the interface.<br><br>That system (of concepts, terms, conventions, skills, customs, conventions, organizational roles, working methods, etc.) is to receive a fantastic stimulus and opportunity for evolutionary change as a consequence of the service the computer can offer. The user system has been evolving so placidly in the past (by comparison with the forthcoming era), that there hasn't been the stimulus toward producing an effective, coherent system discipline. But this will change; and the attitudes and help toward this user-system discipline shown by the technologists will make a very large difference. Technologists can't cover both sides of the interface, and there is critical need for the human side (in this context, the \"user system\") to receive a lot of attention.<br><br>What sorts of extensions in capability and application are reasonable-looking candidates for tomorrow's \"intelligent terminal\" environment? One aspect in which I am particularly interested concerns the possibilities for digitized strings of <b>speech</b> to be one of the data forms handled by the terminal. Apparently, by treating human <b>speech</b>-production apparatus as a dynamic system having a limited number of dynamic variables and controllable parameters, analysis over a short period of the recent-past <b>speech</b> signal enables rough prediction of the forthcoming signal, and a relatively low rate of associated data transmissioon can serve adequately to correct the errors in that predictions. If processors at each end of a <b>speech</b>-transmission path both dealt with the same form of model, then there seems to be the potential of transmitting good quality <b>speech</b> with only a few thousand bits per second transmitted between them.<br><br>The digital-packet communication system to which the \"computer terminal\" is attached can then become a very novel telephone system. But consider also that then storage and delivery of \"<b>speech</b>\" messages are possible, too, and from there grows quite a spread of storage and manipulation services for <b>speech</b> strings, to supplement those for text, graphics, video pictures, etc. in the filling out of a \"complete knowledge workshop.\"<br><br></div><div id='full_3'><mark>If we had such analog-to-digital transducers at the display <b>terminals</b> of the NLS system in ARC, we could easily extend the software to provide for tying the recorded <b>speech</b> strings into our on-line files, and for associating them directly with any text (notes, annotations, or transcripions).</mark></div><div> This would allow us, for instance, to use cross-reference links in our text in a manner that now lets us by pointing to them be almost instantly shown the full text of the cited passage. With the <b>speech</b>-string facility, such an act could let us instantly hear the \"playback\" of a cited <b>speech</b> passage.<br><br>Records of meetings and messages could usefully be stored and cited to great advantage. With advances in <b>speech</b>-processing capability, we would expect for instance to let the user ask to \"step along with each press of my control key by a ten-word segment\" (of the <b>speech</b> he would hear through his speaker), or \"jump to the next occurrence of this word\". Associated with the existing \"Dialogue Support System\" as discussed in [1], this <b>speech</b>-string extension would be very exciting. There is every reason to expect a rapid mushrooming in the range of media, processes, and human activity with which our computer <b>terminals</b> are associated.<br><br></div><div id='full_4'><mark>APPENDIX A: MOUSE AND KEYSET, CODES AND CASES 6<br><br>Note: We generally use the <b>keyset</b> with the left hand; therefore, \"a\" is a \"thumb-only\" stroke.</mark></div><div> Of the three <b>buttons</b> on the <b>mouse</b>, the leftmost two are used during <b>keyset</b> input effectively to extend its input code by two bits. Instead of causing character entry, the \"fourth case\" alters the view specification; any number of them can be concatenated, usually terminated by the \"f\" chord to effect a re-creation of the display according to the altered view specification.<br><br>Mouse<br>Buttons: 000 010 100 110<br>  Case:  -0- -1- -2--3-<br><br>Keyset Code<br><br>0 0 0 0 X a A ! show one level less<br><br>0 0 0 X 0 b B \" show one level deeper<br><br>0 0 0 X X c C # show all levels<br><br>0 0 X 0 0 d D $ show top level only<br><br>0 0 X 0 X e E % current statement level<br><br>0 0 X X 0 f F & recreate display<br><br>0 0 X X X g G ' branch show only<br><br>0 X 0 0 0 h H ( g off<br><br>0 X 0 0 X i I ) show content passed<br><br>0 X 0 X 0 j J @ i or k off<br><br>0 X 0 X X k K + show content failed<br><br>0 X X 0 0 l l - show plex only<br><br>0 X X 0 X m M * show statement numbers<br><br>0 X X X 0 n N / hide statement numbers<br><br>0 X X X X o o ^ frozen statement windows<br><br>X 0 0 0 0 p p 0 frozen statement off<br><br>X 0 0 0 X q q 1 show one line less<br><br>X 0 0 X 0 r R 2 show one line more<br><br>X 0 0 X X s S 3 show all lines<br><br>X 0 X 0 0 t T 4 first lines only<br><br>X 0 X 0 X u U 5 normal refresh display<br><br>X 0 X X 0 v V 6 inhibit refresh display<br><br>X 0 X X X w W 7 all lines, all levels<br><br>X X 0 0 0 x X 8 one line, one level<br><br>X X 0 0 X y Y 9 blank lines on<br><br>X X 0 X 0 z Z = blank lines off<br><br>X X 0 X X , < [ (nothing)<br><br>X X X 0 0 . > ] (nothing)<br><br>X X X 0 X ; : _ (nothing)<br><br>X X X X 0 ? \\ ALT centerdot<br><br>X X X X X SP TAB CR (nothing)<br><br><br>APPENDIX B: PHOTOGRAPHS<br><br>Figure 1.

We happened to hit on a good combination early, but there have been subsequent trials (aimed at improvements, or where others more or less copied our design) that didn't work out well. The play in the <b>buttons</b>, the pressure and actuating travel, are also quite important.<br><br>Figure 4. Closeup of underside of <b>mouse</b> (old model), showing orthogonal disk-wheels.

Norton<br>Stanford Research Institute \u2022 Menlo Park, California <br>1973 (AUGMENT,14724,)<br><br><br>Presented at the National Computer Conference, June 4-8, 1973, AFIPS Conference Proceedings, Vol. 42, pp. 9-21.<br><br>CONCEPT OF THE KNOWLEDGE WORKSHOP<br><br>This paper discusses the theme of augmenting a <b>knowledge</b> <b>workshop</b>. The first part of the paper describes the concept and framework of the <b>knowledge</b> <b>workshop</b>. The second part describes aspects of a prototype <b>knowledge</b> <b>workshop</b> being developed within this framework.<br><br>The importance and implications of the idea of <b>knowledge</b> work have been described by Drucker [3, 4]. Considering <b>knowledge</b> to be the systematic organization of information and concepts, he defines the <b>knowledge</b> worker as the person who creates and applies <b>knowledge</b> to productive ends, in contrast to an \"intellectual\" for whom information and concepts may only have importance because they interest him, or to the manual worker who applies manual skills or brawn. In those two books Drucker brings out many significant facts and considerations highly relevant to the theme here, one among them (paraphrased below) being the accelerating rate at which <b>knowledge</b> and <b>knowledge</b> work are coming to dominate the working activity of our society:<br><br>In 1900 the majority and largest single group of Americans obtained their livelihood from the farm. By 1940 the largest single group was industrial workers, especially semiskilled machine operators. By 1960, the largest single group was professional, managerial, and technical -- that is, <b>knowledge</b> workers. By 1975-80 this group will embrace the majority of Americans. The productivity of <b>knowledge</b> has already become the key to national productivity, competitive strength, and economic achievement, according to Drucker. It is <b>knowledge</b>, not land, raw materials, or capital, that has become the central factor in production.<br><br>In his provocative discussions, Drucker makes extensive use of such terms as \"<b>knowledge</b> organizations,\" \"<b>knowledge</b> technologies,\" and \"<b>knowledge</b> societies.\" It seemed a highly appropriate extension for us to coin \"<b>knowledge</b> <b>workshop</b>\" for re-naming the area of our special interest: the place in which <b>knowledge</b> workers do their work. Knowledge <b>workshop</b>s have existed for centuries, but our special concern is their systematic improvement, toward increased effectiveness of this new breed of craftsmen.<br><br>Workshop improvement involves systematic change not only in the tools that help handle and transform the materials, but in the customs, conventions, skills, procedures, working methods, organizational roles, training, etc. by which the workers and their organizations harness their tools, their skills, and their <b>knowledge</b>.<br><br>Over the past ten years, the explicit focus in the Augmentation Research Center (ARC) has been upon the effects and possibilities of new <b>knowledge</b> <b>workshop</b> tools based on the technology of computer timesharing and modern communications [18 - 41]. Since we consider automating many human operations, what we are after could perhaps be termed \"<b>workshop</b> automation.\" But the very great importance of aspects other than the new tools (i.e., conventions, methods, roles) makes us prefer the \"augmentation\" term that hopefully can remain \"whole-scope.\" We want to keep tools in proper perspective within the total system that augments native human capacities toward effective action [1 - 3, 10, 16, 18, 24].<br><br>Development of more effective <b>knowledge</b> <b>workshop</b> technology will require talents and experience from many backgrounds: computer hardware and software, psychology, management science, information science, and operations research, to name a few. These must come together within the framework of a new discipline, focused on the systematic study of <b>knowledge</b> work and its <b>workshop</b> environments.<br><br>TWO WAYS IN WHICH AUGMENTED KNOWLEDGE WORKSHOPS ARE EVOLVING<br><br>Introduction<br><br>First, one can see a definite evolution of new <b>workshop</b> architecture in the trends of computer application systems. An \"augmented <b>workshop</b> <b>domain</b>\" will probably emerge because many special-purpose application systems are evolving by adding useful features outside their immediate special application area. As a result, many will tend to overlap in their general <b>knowledge</b> work supporting features.<br><br>Second, research and development is being directed toward augmenting a \"Core\" Knowledge Workshop <b>domain</b>. This application system development is aimed expressly at supporting basic functions of <b>knowledge</b> work. An important characteristic of such systems is to interface usefully with specialized systems. This paper is oriented toward this second approach.<br><br>Natural Evolution By Scattered Nuclei Expanding Toward a Common \"Knowledge Workshop\" Domain <br><br>Anderson and Coover [15] point out that a decade or more of application-system evolution is bringing about the beginning of relatively rational user-oriented languages for the control interfaces of advanced applications software systems. What is interesting to note is that the functions provided by the \"interface control\" for the more advanced systems are coming to include editors and generalized file-management facilities, to make easier the preparation, execution, and management of the special-purpose tools of such systems.<br><br>It seems probable that special application-oriented systems (languages) will evolve steadily toward helping the user with such associated work as formulating models, documenting them, specifying the different trial runs, keeping track of intermediate results, annotating them and linking them back to the users' model(s), etc. When the results are produced by what were initially the <b>core</b> application programs (e.g., the statistical programs), he will want ways to integrate them into his working notes, illustrating, labeling, captioning, explaining and interpreting them. Eventually these notes will be shaped into memoranda and formal publications, to undergo <b>dialogue</b> and detailed study with and by others [15].<br><br>Once a significant user-oriented system becomes established, with a steady growth of user clientele, there will be natural forces steadily increasing the effectiveness of the system <b>services</b> and steadily decreasing the cost per unit of service. And it will also be natural that the functional <b>domain</b> of an application system will steadily grow outward: \"as long as the information must be in computer form anyway for an adjacent, computerized process, let's consider applying computer aid to Activity X also.\"<br><br>Because the boundary of the Application System has grown out to be \"next to\" Activity X, it has become relatively easy to consider extending the computerized-information <b>domain</b> a bit so that a new application process can support Activity X. After all, the equipment is already there, the users who perform Activity X are already oriented to use integrated computer aid, and generally the computer facilitation of Activity X will prove to have a beneficial affect on the productivity of the rest of the applications system.<br><br>This <b>domain</b>-spreading characteristic is less dependent upon the substantive work area a particular application system supports than it is upon the health and vitality of its development and application (the authors of [15] have important things to say on these issues); however, it appears that continuing growth is bound to occur in many special application <b>domain</b>s, inevitably bringing about overlap in common application \"sub-<b>domain</b>s\" (as seen from the center of any of these nuclei). These special sub<b>domain</b>s include formulating, studying, keeping track of ideas, carrying on <b>dialogue</b>, publishing, negotiating, planning, coordinating, learning, coaching, looking up in the yellow pages to find someone who can do a special service, etc.<br><br></div><div id='full_2'><mark>Considering the Core Knowledge Workshop As a System Domain In Its Own Right <br><br>A second approach to the evolution of a <b>knowledge</b> <b>workshop</b> is to recognize from the beginning the amount and importance of human activity constantly involved in the \"<b>core</b>\" <b>domain</b> of <b>knowledge</b> work -- activity within which more specialized functions are embedded.</mark></div><div><br><br>If you asked a particular <b>knowledge</b> worker (e.g., scientist, engineer, manager, or marketing specialist) what were the foundations of his livelihood, he would probably point to particular skills such as those involved in designing an electric circuit, forecasting a market based on various data, or managing work flow in a project. If you asked him what tools he needed to improve his effectiveness he would point to requirements for aids in designing circuits, analyzing his data, or scheduling the flow of work.<br><br>But, a record of how this person used his time, even if his work was highly specialized, would show that specialized work such as mentioned above, while vital to his effectiveness, probably occupied a small fraction of his time and effort.<br><br>The bulk of his time, for example, would probably be occupied by more general <b>knowledge</b> work: writing a planning or design document; carrying on <b>dialogue</b> with others in writing, in person, or on the telephone; studying documents; filing ideas or other material; formulating problem-solving approaches; coordinating work with others; and reporting results.<br><br>There would seem to be a promise of considerable payoff in establishing a healthy, applications oriented systems development activity within this common, \"<b>core</b>\" <b>domain</b>, meeting the special-application systems \"coming the other way\" and providing them with well-designed <b>services</b> at a natural system-to-system interface.<br><br>It will be much more efficient to develop this <b>domain</b> explicitly, by people oriented toward it, and hopefully with resources shared in a coordinated fashion. The alternative of semi-random growth promises problems such as:<br><br>1) Repetitive solutions for the same functional problems, each within the skewed perspective of a particular special-applications area for which these problems are peripheral issues,<br><br>2) Incompatibility between different application software systems in terms of their inputs and outputs,<br><br>3) Languages and other control conventions inconsistent or based on different principles from one system to another, creating unnecessary learning barriers or other discouragements to cross usage.<br><br>In summary, the two trends in the evolution of <b>knowledge</b> <b>workshop</b>s described above are each valuable and are complementary. Experience and specific tools and techniques can and will be transferred between them.<br><br>There is a very extensive range of \"<b>core</b>\" <b>workshop</b> functions, common to a wide variety of <b>knowledge</b> work, and they factor into many levels and dimensions. In the sections to follow, we describe our developments, activities, and commitments from the expectation that there soon will be increased activity in this <b>core</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>workshop</b> <b>domain</b>, and that it will be evolving \"outward\" to meet the other application systems \"heading inward.\"<br><br>BASIC ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT AUGMENTED KNOWLEDGE WORKSHOPS<br><br>Embedded in a Computer Network<br><br>The computer-based \"tools\" of a <b>knowledge</b> <b>workshop</b> will be provided in the environment of a computer network such as the ARPANET [7, 8, 14]. For instance, the <b>core</b> functions will consist of a network of cooperating processors performing special functions such as editing, publishing, communication of documents and messages, data management, and so forth. Less commonly used but important functions might exist on a single machine. The total computer assisted <b>workshop</b> will be based on many geographically separate systems.<br><br>Once there is a \"digital-packet transportation system,\" it becomes possible for the individual user to reach out through his interfacing processor(s) to access other people and other <b>services</b> scattered throughout a \"community,\" and the \"labor marketplace\" where he transacts his <b>knowledge</b> work literally will not have to be affected by geographical location [27].<br><br>Specialty application systems will exist in the way that specialty shops and <b>services</b> now do -- and for the same reasons. When it is easy to transport the material and negotiate the service transactions, one group of people will find that specialization can improve their cost/effectiveness, and that there is a large enough market within reach to support them. And in the network-coupled computer-resource marketplace, the specialty shops will grow; -- e.g., application systems specially tailored for particular types of analyses, or for checking through text for spelling errors, or for doing the text-graphic document typography in a special area of technical portrayal, and so on. There will be brokers, wholesalers, middle men, and retailers.<br><br>Coordinated Set of User Interface Principles <br><br>There will be a common set of principles, over the many application areas, shaping user interface features such as the language, control conventions, and methods for obtaining help and computer-aided training.<br><br>This characteristic has two main implications. One, it means that while each <b>domain</b> within the <b>core</b> <b>workshop</b> area or within a specialized application system may have a vocabulary unique to its area, this vocabulary will be used within language and control structures common throughout the <b>workshop</b> system. A user will learn to use additional functions by increasing vocabulary, not by having to learn separate \"foreign\" languages. Two, when in trouble, he will invoke help or tutorial functions in a standard way.<br><br>Grades of User Proficiency <br><br>Even a once-in-a-while user with a minimum of learning will want to be able to get at least a few straightforward things done. In fact, even an expert user in one <b>domain</b> will be a novice in others that he uses infrequently. Attention to novice-oriented features is required.<br><br>But users also want and deserve the reward of increased proficiency and capability from improvements in their skills and <b>knowledge</b>, and in their conceptual orientation to the problem <b>domain</b> and to their <b>workshop</b>'s system of tools, methods, conventions, etc. \"Advanced vocabularies\" in every special <b>domain</b> will be important and unavoidable.<br><br>A corollary feature is that workers in the rapidly evolving augmented <b>workshop</b>s should continuously be involved with testing and training in order that their skills and <b>knowledge</b> may harness available tools and methodology most effectively.<br><br>Ease of Communication Between, and Addition of, Workshop Domains<br><br>One cannot predict ahead of time which <b>domain</b>s or application systems within the <b>workshop</b> will want to communicate in various sequences with which others, or what operations will be needed in the future. Thus, results must be easily communicated from one set of operations to another, and it should be easy to add or interface new <b>domain</b>s to the <b>workshop</b>.<br><br>User Programming Capability <br><br>There will never be enough professional programmers and system developers to develop or interface all the tools that users may need for their work. Therefore, it must be possible, with various levels of ease, for users to add or interface new tools, and extend the language to meet their needs. They should be able to do this in a variety of programming languages with which they may have training, or in the basic user-level language of the <b>workshop</b> itself.<br><br>Availability of People Support Services <br><br>An augmented <b>workshop</b> will have more support <b>services</b> available than those provided by computer tools. There will be many people support <b>services</b> as well: besides clerical support, there will be extensive and highly specialized professional <b>services</b>, e.g. document design and typography, data base design and administration, training, cataloging, retrieval formulation, etc. In fact, the marketplace for human <b>services</b> will become much more diverse and active [27].<br><br>Cost Decreasing, Capabilities Increasing<br><br>The power and range of available capabilities will increase and costs will decrease. Modular software designs, where only the software tools needed at any given moment are linked into a person's run-time computer space, will cut system overhead for parts of the system not in use. Modularity in hardware will provide local configurations of terminals and miniprocessors tailored for economically fitting needs. It is obvious that cost of raw hardware components is plummeting; and the assumed large market for <b>knowledge</b> <b>workshop</b> support systems implies further help in bringing prices down.<br><br>The argument given earlier for the steady expansion of vital application systems to other <b>domain</b>s remains valid for explaining why the capabilities of the <b>workshop</b> will increase. Further, increasing experience with the <b>workshop</b> will lead to improvements, as will the general trend in technology evolution.<br><br>Range of Workstations and Symbol Representations <br><br>The range of workstations available to the user will increase in scope and capability. These workstations will support text with large, open-ended character sets, pictures, voice, mathematical notation, tables, numbers and other forms of <b>knowledge</b> representation. Even small portable hand-held consoles will be available [13].<br><br>Careful Development of Methodology <br><br>As much care and attention will be given to the development, analysis, and evaluation of procedures and methodology for use of computer and people support <b>services</b> as to the development of the technological support <b>services</b>.<br><br>Changed Roles and Organizational Structure <br><br>The widespread availability of <b>workshop</b> <b>services</b> will create the need for new organizational structures and roles.<br><br>SELECTED DESCRIPTION OF AUGMENTED WORKSHOP CAPABILITIES <br><br>Introduction <br><br>Within the framework described above, ARC is developing a prototype <b>workshop</b> system. Our system does not meet all the requirements outlined previously, but it does have a powerful set of <b>core</b> capabilities and experience that leads us to believe that such goals can be achieved.<br><br>Within ARC we do as much work as possible using the range of <b>online</b> capabilities offered. We serve not only as researchers, but also as the subjects for the analysis and evaluation of the augmentation system that we have been developing.<br><br>Consequently, an important aspect of the augmentation work done within ARC is that the techniques being explored are implemented, studied, and evaluated with the advantage of intensive everyday usage. We call this research and development strategy \"bootstrapping.\"<br><br>In our experience, complex man-machine systems can evolve only in a pragmatic mode, within real-work environments where there is an appropriate commitment to conscious, controlled, exploratory evolution within the general framework outlined earlier. The plans and commitments described later are a consistent extention of this pragmatic bootstrapping strategy.<br><br>To give the reader more of a flavor of some of the many dimensions and levels of the ARC <b>workshop</b>, four example areas are discussed below in more detail, following a quick description of our physical environment.<br><br>The first area consists of mechanisms for studying and browsing through NLS files as an example of one functional dimension that has been explored in some depth.<br><br>The second area consists of mechanisms for collaboration support -- a <b>subsystem</b> <b>domain</b> important to many application areas.<br><br>The third and fourth areas, support for software engineers and the ARPANET Network Information Center (NIC), show example application <b>domain</b>s based on functions in our <b>workshop</b>.<br><br>General Physical Environment <br><br>Our computer-based tools run on a Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-10 computer, operating with the Bolt, Beranek, and Newman TENEX timesharing system [9]. The computer is connected via an Interface Message Processor (IMP) to the ARPANET [7, 8]. There is a good deal of interaction with Network researchers, and with Network technology, since we operate the ARPA Network Information Center (see below) [39].<br><br>There is a range of terminals: twelve old, but serviceable, display consoles of our own design [26], an IMLAC display, a dozen or so 30 ch/sec portable upper/lower case typewriter terminals, five magnetic tape-cassette storage units that can be used either <b>online</b> or offline, and a 96-character line printer. There are 125 million characters of <b>online</b> disk storage.<br><br>The display consoles are equipped with a typewriter-like keyboard, a five-finger keyset for one-handed character input, and a \"mouse\" -- a device for controlling the position of a cursor (or pointer) on the display screen and for input of certain control commands. Test results on the mouse as a screen-selection device have been reported in [25], and good photographs and descriptions of the physical systems have appeared in [20, 21].<br><br>The <b>core</b> <b>workshop</b> software system and language, called NLS, provides many basic tools, of which a number will be mentioned below. It is our \"<b>core</b>-<b>workshop</b> application system.\"<br><br>During the initial years of <b>workshop</b> development, application and analysis, the basic <b>knowledge</b>-work functions have centered around the composition, modification, and study of structured textual material [26]. Some of the capabilities in this area are described in detail in [26] and are graphically shown in a movie available on loan -- [41].<br><br>The structured-text manipulation has been developed extensively because of its high payoff in the area of applications-system development to which we have applied our augmented <b>workshop</b>. We have delayed addition of graphic-manipulation capabilities because there were important areas associated with the text <b>domain</b> needing exploration and because of limitations in the display system and <b>hardcopy</b> printout.<br><br></div><div id='full_0'><mark>To build the picture of what our Core Knowledge Workshop is like, we first give several in-depth examples, and then list in the section on <b>workshop</b> utility service some \"<b>workshop</b> <b>subsystem</b>s\" that we consider to be of considerable importance to general <b>knowledge</b> work.</mark></div><div><br><br>Studying Online Documents<br><br>Introduction <br><br>The functions to be described form a set of controls for easily moving one around in an information space and allowing one to adjust the scope, format, and content of the information seen [26, 41].<br><br>Given the addition of graphical, numerical, and vocal information, which are planned for addition to the <b>workshop</b>, one can visualize many additions to the concepts below. Even for strictly textual material there are yet many useful ideas to be explored.<br><br>View Specifications<br><br>One may want an overview of a document in a table-of-contents like form on the screen. To facilitate this and other needs, NLS text files are hierarchically structured in a tree form with subordinate material at lower levels in the hierarchy [26].<br><br>The basic conceptual unit in NLS, at each node of the hierarchical file, is called a \"statement\" and is usually a paragraph, sentence, equation, or other unit that one wants to manipulate as a whole.<br><br>A statement can contain many characters -- presently, up to 2000. Therefore, a statement can contain many lines of text. Two of the \"view-specification\" parameters -- depth in the hierarchy, and lines per statement -- can be controlled during study of a document to give various overviews of it. View specifications are given with highly abbreviated control codes, because they are used very frequently and their quick specification and execution make a great deal of difference in the facility with which one studies the material and keeps track of where he is.<br><br>Examples of other view specifications are those that control spacing between statements, and indentation for levels in the hierarchy, and determine whether the <b>identifications</b> associated with statements are to be displayed, which branch(es) in the tree are to be displayed, whether special filters are to be invoked to show only statements meeting specified content requirements or whether statements are to be transformed according to special rules programmed by the user.<br><br>Moving In Information Space<br><br>A related viewing problem is designating the particular location (node in a file hierarchy) to be at the top of the screen. The computer then creates a display of the information from that point according to the view specifications currently in effect.<br><br>The system contains a variety of appropriate commands to do this; they are called jump commands because they have the effect of \"jumping\" or moving one from place to place in the network of files available as a user's information space [26, 33 - 39].<br><br>One can point at a particular statement on the screen and command the system to move on to various positions relative to the selected one, such as up or down in the hierarchical structure, to the next or preceding statement at the same hierarchical level, to the first or last statement at a given level, etc.<br><br>One can tell the system to move to a specifically named point or go to the next occurrence of a statement with a specific content.<br><br>Each time a jump or move is made, the option is offered of including any of the abbreviated view specifications -- a very general, single operation is \"jump to that location and display with this view.\"<br><br>As one moves about in a file one may want to quickly and easily return to a previous view of the file. This is accomplished by saving a piece of the path as one traverses through the file and the specific view at each point, and then allowing return movement to the most recent points saved.<br><br>Another important feature in studying or browsing in a document is being able to quickly move to other documents cited.<br><br>There is a convention (called a \"link\") for citing documents that allows the user to specify a particular file, statement within the file and view specification for initial display when arriving in the cited file.<br><br>A single, quickly executed command (Jump to Link) allows one to point at such a citation, or anywhere in the statement preceding the citation, and the system will go to the specific file and statement cited and show the associated material with the specified view parameters. This allows systems of interlinked documents and highly specific citations to be created.<br><br>A piece of the path through the chain of documents is saved so that one can return easily a limited distance back along his \"trail,\" to previously referenced documents. Such a concept was originally suggested by Bush [1] in a fertile paper that has influenced our thinking in many ways.<br><br>Multiple Windows<br><br>Another very useful feature is the ability to \"split\" the viewing screen horizontally and/or vertically in up to eight rectangular display windows of arbitrary size. Generally two to four windows are all that are used. Each window can contain a different view of the same or different locations, within the same or different files [39].<br><br>Collaborative Dialogue and Teleconferencing<br><br>Introduction<br><br>The approach to collaboration support taken at ARC to date has two main thrusts:<br><br>1) Support for real-time <b>dialogue</b> (teleconferencing) for two or more people at two terminals who want to see and work on a common set of material. The collaborating parties may be further augmented with a voice telephone connection as well.<br><br>2) Support for written, recorded <b>dialogue</b>, <b>distributed</b> over time.<br><br>These two thrusts give a range of capabilities for support of <b>dialogue</b> <b>distributed</b> over time and space.<br><br>Teleconferencing Support<br><br>Consider two people or groups of people who are geographically separated and who want to collaborate on a document, study a computer program, learn to use a new aspect of a system, or perform planning tasks, etc.<br><br>The <b>workshop</b> supports this type of collaboration by allowing them to link their terminals so that each sees the same information and either can control the system. This function is available for both display and typewriter terminal users over the ARPANET.<br><br>The technique is particularly effective between displays because of the high speed of information output and the flexibility of being able to split the screen into several windows, allowing more than one document or view of a document to be displayed for discussion.<br><br>When a telephone link is also established for voice communication between the participants, the technique comes as close as any we know to eliminating the need for collaborating persons or small groups to be physically together for sophisticated interaction.<br><br>A number of other healthy approaches to teleconferencing are being explored elsewhere [11, 12, 16, 17]. It would be interesting to interface to such systems to gain experience in their use within <b>workshop</b>s such as described here.<br><br>Recorded Dialogue Support<br><br>Introduction<br><br>As ARC has become more and more involved in the augmentation of teams, serious consideration has been given to improving intra- and inter-team communication with whatever mixture of tools, conventions, and procedures will help [27, 36, 39].<br><br>If a team is solving a problem that extends over a considerable time, the members will begin to need help in remembering some of the important communications -- i.e., some recording and recalling processes must be invoked, and these processes become candidates for augmentation.<br><br>If the complexity of the team's problem relative to human working capacity requires partitioning of the problem into many parts -- where each part is independently attacked, but where there is considerable interdependence among the parts -- the communication between various people may well be too complex for their own accurate recall and coordination without special aids.<br><br>Collaborating teams at ARC have been augmented by development of a \"Dialogue Support System (DSS),\" containing current and thoroughly used working records of the group's plans, designs, notes, etc. The central feature of this system is the ARC Journal, a specially managed and serviced repository for files and messages.<br><br>The DSS involves a number of techniques for use by <b>distributed</b> parties to collaborate effectively both using general functions in the <b>workshop</b> and special functions briefly described below and more fully in [39]. Further aspects are described in the section on Workshop Utility Service.<br><br>Document or Message Submission <br><br>The user can submit an NLS file, a part of a file, a file prepared on another system in the ARPANET (document), or text typed at submission time (message) to the Journal system. When submitted, a copy of the document or message is transferred to a read-only file whose permanent safekeeping is guaranteed by the Journal system. It is assigned a unique catalog number, and automatically cataloged. Later, catalog indices based on number, author, and \"titleword out of context\" are created by another computer process.<br><br>Nonrecorded <b>dialogue</b> for quick messages or material not likely to be referenced in the future is also permitted.<br><br>One can obtain catalog numbers ahead of time to interlink document citations for related documents that are being prepared simultaneously. Issuing and controlling of catalog numbers is performed by a Number System (an automatic, crash-protected computer process).<br><br>At the time of submission, the user can contribute such information as: title, distribution list, comments, keywords, catalog numbers of documents this new one supersedes (updates), and other information.<br><br>The distribution is specified as a list of unique identification terms (abbreviated) for individuals or groups. The latter option allows users to establish <b>dialogue</b> groups. The system automatically \"expands\" the group identification to generate the distribution list of the individuals and groups that are its members. Special indices of items belonging to subcollections (<b>dialogue</b> groups) can be prepared to aid their members in keeping track of their <b>dialogue</b>. An extension of the mechanisms available for group distribution could give a capability similar to one described by Turoff [17].<br><br>Entry of identification information initially into the system, group expansion, querying to find a persons or groups identification, and other functions are performed by an Identification System.<br><br>Document Distribution<br><br>Documents are <b>distributed</b> to a person in one, two, or all of three of the following ways depending on information kept by the Identification System.<br><br>1) In <b>hardcopy</b> through the U.S. or corporation mail to those not having <b>online</b> access or to those desiring this mode,<br><br>2) Online as citations (for documents) or actual text (for messages) in a special file assigned to each user.<br><br>3) Through the ARPANET for printing or <b>online</b> delivery at remote sites. This delivery is performed using a standard Network wide protocol.<br><br>Document distribution is automated, with <b>online</b> delivery performed by a background computer process that runs automatically at specified times. Printing and mailing are performed by operator and clerical support. With each such printed document, an address cover sheet is automatically printed, so that the associated printout pages only need to be folded in half, stapled, and stamped before being dropped in the mail.<br><br>Document Access<br><br>An effort has been made to make convenient both <b>online</b> and offline access to Journal documents. The master catalog number is the key to accessing documents. Several strategically placed <b>hardcopy</b> master and access collections (libraries) are maintained, containing all Journal documents.<br><br>Automatic catalog-generation processes generate author, number, and titleword indices, both <b>online</b> and in <b>hardcopy</b> [38]. The <b>online</b> versions of the indices can be searched conveniently with standard NLS retrieval capabilities [37, 39, 41].<br><br>Online access to the full text of a document is accomplished by using the catalog number as a file name and loading the file or moving to it by pointing at a citation and asking the system to \"jump\" there as described earlier.<br><br>Software Engineering Augmentation System <br><br>Introduction <br><br>One of the important application areas in ARC's work is software engineering. The economics of large computer systems, such as NLS, indicate that software development and maintenance costs exceed hardware costs, and that software costs are rising while hardware costs are rapidly decreasing. The expected lifetime of most large software systems exceeds that of any piece of computer hardware. Large software systems are becoming increasingly complex, difficult to continue evolving and maintain. Costs of additional enhancements made after initial implementation generally exceed the initial cost over the lifetime of the system. It is for these reasons that it is important to develop a powerful application area to aid software engineering. Areas of software engineering in which the ARC <b>workshop</b> offers aids are described below.<br><br>Design And Review Collaboration <br><br>During design and review, the document creation, editing, and studying capabilites are used as well as the collaboration, described above.<br><br>Use Of Higher Level System Programming Languages <br><br>Programming of NLS is performed in a higher level ALGOL-like system programming language called L-10 developed at ARC. The L-10 language compiler takes its input directly from standard NLS structured files. The PDP-10 assembler also can obtain input from NLS files.<br><br>It is planned to extend this capability to other languages, for example, by providing an interface to the BASIC system available in our machine for <b>knowledge</b> workers wishing to perform more complex numerical tasks.<br><br>We are involved with developing a modular runtime-linkable programming system (MPS), and with planning a redesign of NLS to utilize MPS capabilities, both in cooperation with the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center. MPS will:<br><br>1) Allow a <b>workshop</b> system organization that will make it easier for many people to work on and develop parts of the same complex system semi-independently.<br><br>2) Make it easier to allow pieces of the system to exist on several processors.<br><br>3) Allow individual users or groups of users to tailor versions of the system to their special needs.<br><br>4) Make it easier to move NLS to other computers since MPS is written in itself.<br><br>5) Speed system development because of MPS's improved system building language facilities, integrated source-level debugging, measurement facilities, the ability to construct new modules by combining old ones, and to easily modify the system by changing module interconnection.<br><br>System Documentation And Source-Code Creation<br><br>Source-code creation uses the standard NLS hierarchical file structures and allows documentation and other programming conventions to be established that simplify studying of source-code files.<br><br>Debugging<br><br>A form of source-level debugging is allowed through development of several tools, of which the following are key examples:<br><br>1) A user program compilation and link loading facility that allows new or replacement programs to be linked into the running system to create revised versions for testing or other purposes.<br><br>2) NLS-DDT, a DDT like debugging facility with a command language more consistent with the rest of NLS, and simplifies display of system variables and data structures, and allows replacement of system procedures by user supplied procedures.<br><br>3) Use of several display windows so as to allow source code in some windows and control of DDT in others for the setting of breakpoints and display of variables and data structures.<br><br>Measurement And Analysis<br><br>A range of measurement tools has been developed for analyzing system operation. These include the following:<br><br>1) Capabilities for gathering and reporting statistics on many operating system parameters such as utilization of system components in various modes, queue lengths, memory utilization, etc.<br><br>2) The ability to sample the program counter for intervals of a selectable area of the operating system or any particular user <b>subsystem</b> to measure time spent in the sampled areas;<br><br>3) Trace and timing facilities to follow all procedure calls during execution of a specified function.<br><br>4) The ability to study page-faulting characteristics of a <b>subsystem</b> to check on its memory use characteristics.<br><br>5) The ability to gather NLS command usage and timing information.<br><br>6) The ability to study user interaction on a task basis from the point of view of the operating-system scheduler.<br><br>7) The ability to collect sample user sessions for later playback to the system for simulated load, or for analysis.<br><br>Maintenance<br><br>Maintenance programmers use the various functions mentioned above. The Journal is used for reporting bugs; NLS structured source code files simplify the study of problem areas and the debugging tools permit easy modification and testing of the modifications.<br><br>The ARPA Network Information Center (NIC)<br><br>Introduction<br><br>The NIC is presently a project embedded within ARC [39]. Workshop support for the NIC is based on the capabilities within the total ARC <b>workshop</b> system.<br><br>As useful as is the bootstrapping strategy mentioned earlier, there are limits to the type of feedback it can yield with only ARC as the user population. The NIC is the first of what we expect will be many activities set up to offer <b>services</b> to outside users. The goal is to provide a useful service and to obtain feedback on the needs of a wider class of <b>knowledge</b> workers. Exercised within the NIC are also prototypes of information <b>services</b> expected to be normal parts of the <b>workshop</b>.<br><br>The NIC is more than a classical information center, as that term has come to be used, in that it provides a wider range of <b>services</b> than just bibliographic and \"library\" type <b>services</b>.<br><br>The NIC is an experiment in setting up and running a general purpose information service for the ARPANET community with both <b>online</b> and offline <b>services</b>. The <b>services</b> offered and under development by the NIC have as their initial basic objectives:<br><br>1) To help people with problems find the resources (people, systems, and information) available within the network community that meet their needs.<br><br>2) To help members of geographically <b>distributed</b> groups collaborate with each other.<br><br>Following are the NIC <b>services</b> now provided to meet the above goals in serving the present clientele:<br><br>Current Online Services<br><br>1) Access to the typewriter version (TNLS) and display version (DNLS) of the Augmentation Research Center's Online System (NLS) for communique creation, access, and linking between users, and for experimental use for any other information storage and manipulation purpose suitable for NLS and useful to Network participants.<br><br>2) Access to Journal, Number, and Identification Systems to allow messages and documents to be transmitted between network participants.<br><br>3) Access to a number of <b>online</b> information bases through a special Locator file using NLS link mechanisms and through a novice-oriented query system.<br><br>Current Offline Services <br><br>1) A Network Information Center Station set up at each network site.<br><br>2) Techniques for gathering, producing and maintaining data bases such as bibliographic catalogs, directories of network participants, resource information, and user guides.<br><br>3) Support of Network <b>dialogue</b> existing in <b>hardcopy</b> through duplication, distribution, and cataloging.<br><br>4) General Network referral and handling of document requests.<br><br>5) Building of a collection of documents potentially valuable to the Network Community. Initial concentration has been on obtaining documents of possible value to the Network builders.<br><br>6) As yet primitive selective document distribution to Station Collections.<br><br>7) Training in use of NIC <b>services</b> and facilities.<br><br>Conclusion <br><br>The Network Information Center is an example prototype of a new type of information service that has significant future potential. Even though it is presently in an experimental and developmental phase, it is providing useful <b>online</b> and offline <b>services</b> to the ARPANET community.<br><br>PLANS FOR A WORKSHOP UTILITY SERVICE<br><br>Motivation<br><br>It is now time for a next stage of application to be established. We want to involve a wider group of people so that we can begin to transfer the fruits of our past work to them and with their assistance, to others, and so that we can obtain feedback needed for further evolution from wider application than is possible in our project alone [28]. We want to find and support selected groups who are willing to take extra trouble to be exploratory, but who:<br><br>1) Are not necessarily oriented to being <b>core</b>-<b>workshop</b> developers (they have their own work to do).<br><br>2) Can see enough benefit from the system to be tried and from the experience of trying it so that they can justify the extra risk and expense of being \"early birds\".<br><br>3) Can accept assurance that system reliability and stability, and technical/application help will be available to meet their conditions for risk and cost.<br><br></div><div id='full_1'><mark>ARC is establishing a Workshop Utility Service, and promoting the type of <b>workshop</b> service described above as part of its long-term commitment to pursue the continued development of augmented <b>knowledge</b> <b>workshop</b>s in a pragmatic, evolutionary manner.</mark></div><div><br><br>It is important to note that the last few years of work have concentrated on the means for delivering support to a <b>distributed</b> community, for providing teleconferencing and other basic processes of collaborative <b>dialogue</b>, etc. ARC has aimed consciously toward developing experience and capabilities especially applicable to support remote and <b>distributed</b> groups of exploratory users for this next stage of wider-application bootstrapping.<br><br>One aspect of the service is that it will be an experiment in harnessing the new environment of a modern computer network to increase the feasibility of a wider community of participants cooperating in the evolution of an application system.<br><br>Characteristics of the Planned Service<br><br>The planned service offered will include:<br><br>1) Availability of Workshop Utility computer service to the user community from a PDP-10 TENEX system operated by a commercial supplier.<br><br>2) Providing training as appropriate in the use of Display NLS (DNLS), Typewriter NLS (TNLS), and Deferred Execution (DEX) software <b>subsystem</b>s.<br><br>3) Providing technical assistance to a user organization \"<b>workshop</b> architect\" in the formulation, development, and implementation of augmented <b>knowledge</b> work procedures within selected offices at the user organization [6].<br><br>This assistance will include help in the development of NLS use strategies suitable to the user environments, procedures within the user organization for implementing these strategies, and possible special-application NLS extensions (or simplifications) to handle the mechanics of particular user needs and methodologies.<br><br>4) Providing \"<b>workshop</b> architect\" assistance to help set up and assist selected geographically <b>distributed</b> user groups who share a special discipline or mission orientation to utilize the <b>workshop</b> utility <b>services</b> and to develop procedures, documentation, and methodology for their purposes.<br><br>General Description of Some Workshop Utility Subsystems <br><br>Introduction<br><br>Within a particular professional task area (mission- or discipline-oriented) there are often groups who could be benefitted by using special <b>workshop</b> <b>subsystem</b>s. These <b>subsystem</b>s may be specialized for their specific application or research <b>domain</b> or for support of their more general <b>knowledge</b> work. Our goal is to offer a <b>workshop</b> utility service that contains a range of <b>subsystem</b>s and associated methodology particularly aimed at aiding general <b>knowledge</b> work, and that also supports in a coordinated way special application <b>subsystem</b>s either by interfacing to <b>subsystem</b>s already existing, or by developing new <b>subsystem</b>s in selected areas.<br><br>In the descriptions to follow are a number of <b>workshop</b> <b>subsystem</b> <b>domain</b>s that are fundamental to a wide range of <b>knowledge</b> work in which ARC already has extensive developments or is committed to work. For each <b>subsystem</b> we include some general comments as well as a brief statement of current ARC capabilities in the area.<br><br>Document Development, Production, And Control<br><br>Here a system is considered involving authors, editors, supervisors, typists, distribution-control personnel, and technical specialists. Their job is to develop documents, through successive drafts, reviews, and revisions. Control is needed along the way of bibliography, who has checked what point, etc. . Final drafts need checkoff, then production. Finally distribution needs some sort of control. If it is what we call a \"functional document\" such as a user guide, then it needs to be kept up to date [39]. There is a further responsibility to keep track of who needs the documents, who has what version, etc.<br><br>Within the ARC <b>workshop</b>, documents ranging from initial drafts to final high-quality printed publications can be quickly produced with a rich set of creation and editing functions. All of ARC's proposals, reports, designs, letters, thinkpieces, user documentaion, and other such information are composed and produced using the <b>workshop</b>.<br><br>Documents in a proof or finished form can be produced with a limited character set and control on a line printer or typewriter, or publication-quality documents can be produced on a photocomposer microfilm unit.<br><br>Presently there are on the order of two hundred special directives that can be inserted in text to control printing. These directives control such features as typefont, pagination, margins, headers, footers, statement spacing, typefont size and spacing, indenting, numbering of various hierarchical levels, and many other parameters useful for publication quality work.<br><br>Methodology to perform the creation, production, and controlling functions described above has been developed, although much work at this level is still needed.<br><br>In terms of future goals, one would like to have display terminals with a capability for the range of fonts available on the photocomposer so that one could study page layout and design interactively, showing the font to be used, margins, justification, columnization, etc. on the screen rather than having to rely on <b>hardcopy</b> proofsheets.<br><br>To prepare for such a capability, plans are being made to move toward an integrated portrayal mechanism for both <b>online</b> and <b>hardcopy</b> viewing.<br><br>Collaborative Dialogue And Teleconferencing<br><br>Effective capabilities have already been developed and are in application, as discussed above. There is much yet to do. The Dialogue Support System will grow to provide the following additional general <b>online</b> aids:<br><br>Link-setup automation; back-link annunciators and jumping; aids for the formation, manipulation, and study of sets of arbitrary passages from among the <b>dialogue</b> entries; and integration of cross-reference information into <b>hardcopy</b> printouts. Interfaces will probably be made to other teleconferencing capabilities that come into existence on the ARPANET.<br><br>It also will include people-system developments: conventions and working procedures for using these aids effectively in conducting collaborative <b>dialogue</b> among various kinds of people, at various kinds of terminals, and under various conditions; working methodology for teams doing planning, design, implementation coordination; and so on.<br><br>Meetings And Conferences<br><br>Assemblies of people are not likely for a long time, if ever, to be supplanted in total by technological aids. Online conferences are held at ARC for local group meetings and for meetings where some of the participants are located across the country.<br><br>Use is made of a large-screen projection TV system to provide a display image that many people in a conference room can easily see. This is controlled locally or remotely by participants in the meeting, giving access to the entire recorded <b>dialogue</b> data base as needed during the meeting and also providing the capability of recording real-time meeting notes and other data. The technique also allows mixing of other video signals.<br><br>Management And Organization<br><br>The capabilities offered in the <b>workshop</b> described in this paper are used in project management and administration [39]. Numerical calculations can also be performed for budget and other purposes, obtaining operands and returning results to NLS files for further manipulation.<br><br>Where an organization has conventional project management operations, their <b>workshop</b> can include computer aids for techniques such as PERT and CPM. We want to support the interfacing that our Core Workhop can provide to special application systems for management processes.<br><br>We are especially interested, at this stage, in management of project teams -- particularly, of application-systems development teams.<br><br>Handbook Development <br><br>Capabilities described above are being extended toward the coordinated handling of a very large and complex body of documentation and its associated external references. The goal is that a project or discipline of ever-increasing size and complexity can be provided with a service that enables the users to keep a single, coordinated \"superdocument\" in their computer; that keeps up to date and records the state of their affairs; and provides a description of the state of the art in their special area.<br><br>Example contents would be glossaries, basic concept structure, special analytic techniques, design principles, actual design, and implementation records of all developments.<br><br>Research Intelligence<br><br>The provisions within the Dialogue Support System for cataloging and indexing internally generated items also support the management for externally generated items, bibliographies, contact reports, clippings, notes, etc. Here the goal is to give a human organization (<b>distributed</b> or local) an ever greater capability for integrating the many input data concerning its external environment; processing (filtering, transforming, integrating, etc.) the data so that it can be handled on a par with internally generated information in the organization's establishing of plans and goals; and adapting to external opportunities or dangers [38].<br><br>Computer-Based Instruction<br><br>This is an important area to facilitate increasing the skills of <b>knowledge</b> workers. ARC has as yet performed little direct work in this area. We hope in the future to work closely with those in the computer-based instruction area to apply their techniques and systems in the <b>workshop</b> <b>domain</b>.<br><br>In training new and developing users in the use of the system, we have begun using the system itself as a teaching environment. This is done locally and with remote users over the ARPANET.<br><br>Software Engineering Augmentation <br><br>A major special application area described above, that has had considerable effort devoted to it, is support of software engineers. The software-based tools of the <b>workshop</b> are designed and built using the tools previously constructed. It has long been felt [24, 29] that the greatest \"bootstrapping\" leverage would be obtained by intensively developing the augmented <b>workshop</b> for software engineers, and we hope to stimulate and support more activity in this area.<br><br>Knowledge Workshop Analysis<br><br>Systematic analysis has begun of the <b>workshop</b> environment at internal system levels, at user usage levels, and at information-handling procedure and methodology levels. The development of new analytic methodology and tools is a part of this process. The analysis of application systems, and especially of <b>core</b>-<b>workshop</b> systems, is a very important capability to be developed. To provide a special <b>workshop</b> <b>subsystem</b> that augments this sort of analytic work is a natural strategic goal.<br><br></div><div id='full_4'><mark>CONCLUSION -- THE NEED FOR LONG-TERM COMMITMENT <br><br>As work progresses day-to-day toward the long-term goal of helping to make the truly augmented <b>knowledge</b> <b>workshop</b>, and as communities of <b>workshop</b> users become a reality, we at ARC frequently reflect on the magnitude of the endeavor and its long-term nature [22].</mark></div><div><br><br>Progress is made in steps, with hundreds of short-term tasks directed to strategically selected subgoals, together forming a vector toward our higher-level goals.<br><br>To continue on the vector has required a strong commitment to the longer-range goals by the staff of ARC.<br><br>In addition, we see that many of the people and organizations we hope to enlist in cooperative efforts will need a similar commitment if they are to effectively aid the process.<br><br>One of ARC's tasks is to make the long-term objectives of the <b>workshop</b>'s evolutionary development, the potential value of such a system, and the strategy for realizing that value clear enough to the collaborators we seek, so that they will have a strong commitment to invest resources with understanding and patience.<br><br>One key for meeting this need will be to involve them in serious use of the <b>workshop</b> as it develops.

Engelbart <br>Augmentation Research Center <br>Stanford Research Institute <br>29-Jul-75 12:43 (AUGMENT,33076,) <br><br>Abstract<br><br>NLS is an extensive system of computer aids being evolved toward supplying a coherent, comprehensive environment in which a knowledge worker can do all of his central, everyday work. Support for collaborative <b>dialogue</b> among distributed participants is one important component of the system.<br><br>The Journal is an NLS <b>subsystem</b> with basic methods for handling full-text computerized <b>items</b> that parallel those of open-literature professional <b>journals</b> and associated library services -- i.e. a permananent record of any published item, <b>citation</b> conventions by which later readers can retrieve and <b>access</b> references to other <b>items</b>, and catalogs and indices for retrieval aid. Each of these processes is done much faster in our computer environment, and other computerized services may be added. Altogether this provides a very powerful foundation for a new level of collaboration via recorded <b>dialogue</b>.<br><br>The Shared-Screen Telephone option for conference collaboration stems from a special \"connection\" feature in NLS that enables mutually agreeing users of Display NLS (DNLS) to connect through the computer system, sharing the same NLS control and display portrayal. When simultaneously talking on the telephone and making use of NLS's other extensive features, two people can confer very effectively at great distances.<br><br>Our experience with these \"<b>teleconferencing</b>\" provisions brings out two important points: (1) computer-aided <b>teleconferencing</b> is much enhanced when integrated coherently with effective computer aids for doing one's other knowledge-work operations, and (2) computer networks add critically important capabilities to this enhanced form of <b>telconferencing</b>.<br><br>Introduction<br><br>One purpose of this paper is to publish a note about two powerful modes of computer-aided collaboration; the other is to highlight a poorly appreciated factor regarding the utility to be derived from computer networks -- how these networks will facilitate human collaboration in a unique and powerful way.<br><br>The <b>telconferencing</b> features described in this paper are implemented as coordinated parts of NLS, the oN Line System developed at Stanford Research Institute over the past twelve years. A goal underlying the evolution of NLS is to provide an effective \"<b>workplace</b>\" in which a knowledge worker can keep his everyday working materials and do his everyday work. Providing him with a personalized, computerized <b>workplace</b> for \"core\" materials and tasks (akin to what his office provides for him) has been one of two main concerns. The other concern has been to develop a multi-computer, multi-tool framework wherein from this familiar <b>workplace</b> a user can reach through to <b>access</b> materials and tools from a rich marketplace of specialty services. We have a strong feeling that most people working in such an environment will want to reach through to work with other people at least as often as with computer services. References 1 and 2 provide useful framework fill-in regarding our goals and approach.<br><br>There are tens of thousands of hours of accumulated experience in using NLS to do real work, spreading back over a decade, with hundreds of people. The Journal system, with over twenty thousand <b>items</b> in it, is a regular part of the working culture for perhaps a hundred people. The Network Information Center (NIC) has been serving users of the ARPANET since 1971. We have been supporting remote NLS users over the ARPANET in steadily growing numbers -- for four years through the NIC services, and for the last year and a half through our Knowledge Workshop Utility service. The latter is a private, not-for-profit venture launched by SRI to provide <b>subscribers</b> with what for a very advanced system is a very solid computer service. The Utility brings NLS computer aids into terminals in the <b>subscribers</b>' offices for exploratory application by their people on their knowledge work. Also, the Utility has a staff of trainers that circulate between subscriber sites to help develop basic knowledge and skills, help iron out the problems in a group's evolution into different ways of working, and transfer application lore.<br><br>Our orientation and work methods have produced an approach to knowledge-workshop development and application that seems fundamentally usable for any special area of facilitation, i.e. whether it is for project documentation, intra-group collaboration, special-forms handling, correspondence, individualized bibliographic <b>citation</b> management -- or, for <b>telconferencing</b>. Our goal is to establish enough daily users of an advanced system so that a particular service sub-system (such as a mode of <b>teleconferencing</b>) can be tested and evolved in an environment which will closely resemble that of the future. As we see it, tomorrow's users will be people working purposefully on daily tasks in a computerized <b>workplace</b>, and the subject sub-system will be employed within a sequence of other-work operations that enrich the possibilities for harnessing it while providing a balanced view of cost, payoff, relative value among intangibles, and so forth.<br><br>Basic Description of NLS<br><br>NLS is a powerful, advanced system designed to support basic knowledge work. It has many noteworthy features. I will describe a sketchy few to support an image of the power derived from the <b>dialogue</b>-support applications featured here. (Reference 3 provides an introduction to the central set of NLS features.)<br><br>Access to the materials and tools in an NLS workspace can be via an <b>online</b> typewriter (using TNLS), or via a CRT terminal using a cursor-control pointing device (using DNLS -- our \"mouse\" is the main pointing device in use), or via a batched mix of input text and control directives for \"deferred execution\" (using the DEX <b>subsystem</b>). The control language and the display-terminal setup are designed for generality, application independence, and flexible growth of control vocabulary and task procedures.<br><br>A \"base\" set of features supports the most common activities, such as composing, studying, organizing, and modifying information. There are extensive provisions for editing text structured in hierarchic files, moving about within files via generalized addressing features, and flexibly creating parametric views to support rapidly shifting needs for studying or manipulating text. For instance, a common view shows only the text <b>items</b> in two particular levels of a hierarchically organized document, and only the first line of each item (whether header or paragraph). The CRT screen can also be split into different windows, where material from different locations (including different files) can be viewed simultaneously. Copying or moving selected <b>items</b> is as naturally performed between windows as within a window.<br><br>Different <b>subsystem</b>s of tools, for special-application activities, are easy to develop and easy for a user to invoke. Some of these <b>subsystem</b>s are maintained as standard \"tool kits\" by the Utility; others are created experimentally. Some special <b>subsystem</b>s are for adjusting any of the extensive options that may be individually chosen for each user (equivalent to chair height, location of lights, telephone-ring loudness, and so forth); for compiling and debugging software; for hand-driven calculation (pointing to textual numeric data to be operated upon by your 'hand calculator'); and for locating user-reference material. In particular, one such special <b>subsystem</b> supports the Journal-<b>submission</b> process.<br><br>Recorded-Dialogue Systems<br><br>Consider a system such as is run by a professional journal within the service structure offered by our libraries. An <b>author</b>, by some process, gets an item published. This is followed by a particular series of processes and services.<br><br></div><div id='full_4'><mark>Direct distribution -- Each person on a certain readership list is automatically sent a copy of the bundled set of <b>items</b> (issue of the journal) in which the new item is included by the batching process of journal publication.</mark></div><div><br><br>Private hard-copy for personal use -- this is often desired. Office copiers now make this very simple (although with a slight tint of copyright illegality).<br><br>Storage, retrieval searches, and later <b>access</b> -- A reliable library system will get a copy and store it so that the copy can later be produced if asked for by an explicit, conventional identifier (e.g., Volume X of Journal Y). Other associated organizations (e.g. one's research department, or the orderly colleague down the hall who subscribes and saves) usually provide auxiliary means for gaining later <b>access</b> to the published document -- but let us consider all such under the statement that \"it is expected that with reasonable effort a person can later gain <b>access</b> to a specific item when its identifier is known.\" Some time after initial publication various indexing services provide support for retrieval searches. The journal and/or a related professional association may provide cumulative indexing periodically. These are available at a good library, where one can do a retrieval process to unearth likely <b>citation</b>s, <b>access</b> the document, and walk away with a private copy.<br><br>Citation practices -- For a true <b>dialogue</b> to work within this system, careful conventions must be followed about <b>citing</b> previously published <b>items</b>. An important value derived from the above storage and <b>access</b> provisions is that when one <b>author</b> wants to write about the work of another, he can cite it explicitly in his text with assurance that his reader has a straightforward way to <b>access</b> the cited work. Where this cited-work <b>access</b>ibility is dubious, an <b>author</b> is considerably burdened.<br><br>Over a period of time the <b>citation</b>s to prior works grow into a branching network that keeps earlier, relevant writings linked to present thinking.<br><br>The NLS Journal System<br><br>Our Journal system was conceived by this <b>author</b> in about 1966. I wanted an underlying operational process, for use by individuals and groups, that would help bring order into the time stream of the augmented knowledge workers. The term \"journal\" emerged early in the conceptualization process for two reasons: (1) I felt it important in many dynamic operations to keep a log (sometimes termed a \"journal\") that chronicles events by means of a series of unchangeable entries (for instance, to log significant events while evolving a plan, shaping up a project, trouble-shooting a large operation, or monitoring on-going operations). These entries would be preserved in original form, serving as the grist for later integration into more organized treatments. (2) I also wanted something that would serve essentially the same recorded-<b>dialogue</b> purpose as I perceived a professional journal (plus library) to do.<br><br>We established an explicit Dialogue Support System sub-module in our emerging concept of an \"augmented knowledge workshop\" system. The earliest thrust in this sub-module was the Journal. After several aborted starts, the current form finally began operation in the summer of 1970. It has served excellently. In our Center, we couldn't imagine doing without a service like this and still seriously claiming that we were using computer tools to best advantage.<br><br>Direct distribution -- A special NLS <b>subsystem</b> supports <b>submission</b> and subsequent distribution of the messages, memos, data records, or documents that become permanently \"published\" in our NLS Journal. An <b>online</b> directory file is maintained in which all of the \"registered\" <b>dialogue</b> participants are catalogued; each has a short, personal \"IDENT\" code (mine are my initials, \"DCE\") that can be found by simple interrogation of this directory. Groups can be given IDENTs also, and the IDENT of one group can appear in the membership set of another group. When one submits an item to the Journal System, he provides any number of IDENTS in a \"For Action\" category, and any number in the \"For Information\" category.<br><br>The IDENT directory contains for each recipient a specification as to where and how his \"mail\" is to be delivered. Each recipient has a specially designated \"mail box\" section in his mail-reception file. For a short item, a formatted <b>citation</b> header and a complete copy of the text are automatically delivered into this mail box. </div><div id='full_3'><mark>For longer <b>items</b>, only a <b>citation</b> is delivered, containing title, <b>author</b> IDENT, date and time of <b>submission</b>, any associated <b>author</b> comment, a tag for either \"Action\" or \"Info Only\" classification, and a computer-useable <b>citation</b> link to the full text.</mark></div><div> The recipient can follow the link to read the item <b>online</b>, or else to produce a hard-copy printout.<br><br>Private hard-copy for personal use -- An automatic hard-copy delivery option is available, although most users choose the \"<b>online</b> delivery.\"<br><br>Storage, retrieval searches, and later <b>access</b> -- Title and optional comments are provided at <b>submission</b> time. Many other cataloging elements may also be introduced. For example, a pre-assigned <b>access</b>ion number (previously supplied by interactive request by the <b>author</b> with this <b>submission</b> <b>subsystem</b>) may be designated for those cases where cross-referencing is desired and one needs to determine a document's <b>access</b>ion identifier before its <b>submission</b> time. The <b>access</b>ion number of a Journal item being superseded by this new one may also be referenced, or special descriptors may be added.<br><br>If not handed a pre-assigned number, the Journal system automatically assigns a permanent <b>access</b>ion number to a new item, sets up a catalog entry, and stores it in \"permanent\" archives which provide the same type of frozen record that traditional publication does. These archives may be <b>access</b>ed at any time, and the user may once again view the Journal item <b>online</b>, or make a hard-copy.<br><br></div><div id='full_0'><mark>Citation practices -- If in reading an item <b>online</b> the user comes across a <b>citation</b> link to a passage in another Journal item, he can follow it directly to a specified passage in the cited item.</mark></div><div> In writing a Journal item there is a great feeling of freedom about <b>citing</b> other <b>items</b>, given these expectations of easy <b>access</b>ibility. This freedom fosters the use of very short <b>dialogue</b> contributions; when several succinct <b>citation</b> links, directed at specific passages, can be easily used for nouns in a sentence, one can communicate important contributions very quickly and easily.<br><br></div><div id='full_1'><mark>The NLS Journal serves its users in a manner similar to professsional <b>journals</b>, with these significant quantitative differences: fast, flexible computer aids serve an <b>author</b> in creating a <b>dialogue</b> item, and help multiple <b>author</b>s to collaborate toward that end; publication time is very much shorter; significant \"articles\" may be as short as one sentence; cross-reference <b>citation</b>s may easily be much more specific (i.e., pointing directly to a specific passage); catalogs and indexes can be <b>access</b>ed and searched <b>online</b> as well as in hard copy; and full-text retrieval with short delays is the basic operating mode.</mark></div><div> The end effect of these changes is a form of recorded <b>dialogue</b> whose impact and value has a dramatic qualitative difference over the traditional, hard-copy journal system.<br><br>Our Journal system has been in regular and increasingly heavy use for five years. First users were Center staff members, who approached its use with caution and mixed feelings. </div><div id='full_2'><mark>The <b>access</b>ion numbers are in the 30,000s now -- probably 20,000 are used for Journal <b>items</b> and 10,000 for catalogued hard-copy <b>items</b> whose <b>access</b>ion numbers are taken from the same sequence as the Journal numbers.</mark></div><div><br><br>Since whole documents may be submitted to the Journal it is common practice to submit trial designs and thinkpieces, inviting comment that will appear as a collection of <b>items</b> that cite various sections (or the whole) of the trial piece and often cite other response <b>items</b> as well. Such a sequence has a function similar to other computer-message <b>teleconferencing</b> systems that record a \"conference session\". Here, though, any item may also be part of other \"sessions,\" or may have <b>citation</b> links to any item at large that a participant may feel is relevant.<br><br>At the option of the <b>author</b> privacy controls may be stipulated at <b>submission</b> time. Only those on the original distribution list may <b>access</b> the item, and the item will not appear in any of the public indexes.<br><br>The NLS Shared-Screen Facility<br><br>In this mode of <b>teleconferencing</b>, two or more people, positioned at separated display consoles, can link their displays so that all see the same image, and at option any can exercise control. When simultaneously talking on the telephone the resulting <b>dialogue</b> can be uniquely effective -- corresponding to an in-person conference around a collective assemblage of their scratch pads, working records, and individual support facilities. To add extra power to such sessions, special conferencing-aid tools and conventions can certainly be developed to advantage.<br><br>But consider the great potential already existing when some of the participants -- or even a single participant -- can effectively use computer tools to work with the relevant materials and processes. There is great value in merely conducting themselves as though they were congregated at a magic blackboard -- each easily able to pull forth materials from his notes or familiar reference sources, copy across into his private <b>workplace</b> any material offered from what the other brings forth, and actually demonstrate his own methods, conventions, and special skills, or demonstrate the circumstances where he has trouble and would like advice. There can be sessions for coaching, reviewing, mutual problem solving, demonstrating, etc. The more comprehensive and efficient the collective tools and skills are for doing a single individual's kind of work, the more effective such collaborative sessions can be.<br><br>Impact of Collaboration on Network Utility<br><br>Both of these types of collaborative <b>dialogue</b> will undoubtedly need to be generalized in the future. A computer-supported worker would like to connect to many differenct people in shared-screen, telephoning mode, eventually as a generalized option to telephoning. And sharing in recorded <b>dialogue</b> can't help but be an extremely important foundation for group effectiveness. We must acknowledge that the march of technology will allow us to record ever broader <b>dialogue</b> media for effective studying, and integration, leading to the day when a shared-screen telephone session, with full video connection of participants' images, can be captured in total, within digitized data forms, to be submitted as an item of recorded <b>dialogue</b> so others can later benefit from the record of the real-time conferencing.<br><br>Consider the mutual implications of these possibilities for technologically supported collaboration and the potential growth of computer networks. It is obvious that the richer the set of tools and <b>online</b> working practices of the participants, the more striking the value will be of either of these modes of <b>teleconferencing</b>, and therefore the faster the growth in seriously used collaboration techniques. Also, the value of the computer-held <b>workplace</b> will be considerably enhanced through networking to bring a dymanic marketplace into life.<br><br>It is obvious that the collaboration will not be served effectively by merely connecting the participants' terminals to each other, or even by connecting to each terminal through a common, central support system. What is necessary is broad-band interconnection between the processes of the participants' respective home <b>workplace</b>s. Other than with networks, how could this broad-band coupling sensibly be provided for collaborators whose home <b>workplace</b>s are supported in different machine systems?<br><br>Reference 4 provides a framework description of how a community of knowledge workers, joined in either a common mission or by a common discipline, could become considerably more effective if they availed themselves of a coordinated set of information services. The first-listed service is \"collaborative <b>dialogue</b>.\" The premise of the paper is that the data, computer processes, and terminals are tied together by computer networking; and the most basic issue is that the human resources--knowlede, skill, creativity, intelligence, and drive--are the important things to bring together. For human beings to collaborate effectively in the future through coordinated information systems, it seems unquestionable to me that computer networking is the inevitable foundation upon which communication will rest.<br><br>Acknowledgements<br><br>The research and development for the described work has been supported by several sponsors over tha past years: the Information Processing Techniques Office of the Defense Advanced Projects Research Agency has given strong basic support over the entire period; the Air Force's Rome Air Development Center has been a steady supporter; the Office of Naval Research provided key support for some of the particulars in managing Journal catalogs; NASA's Langley Research Center gave parallel support with ARPA during the Journal System's formative years.

The Air Force Office of Scientific Research <b>support</b>ed my study for several years, resulting in a publication that provided a conceptual framework and a basic strategy for a long-term program (3). In 1963 the Advanced Research Projects Agency began twelve years of continuous funding, during which there was also significant <b>support</b> from the Air Force Electronic Systems Division, NASA Langley Reseach Center, Air Force Rome Air Development Center, and the Office of Naval Research.<br><br>By 1968, we had a core system, called NLS, that was quite powerful for editing mixed text and graphics, for managing project-sized knowledge bases for design, documentation and financial activities, and for <b>support</b>ing group collaboration. This was described in a paper in that year's Proceedings of the Fall Joint Computer Conference, held in San Francisco (4). We also put on a real-time description and demonstration in a special session at the Conference, controlling the system from a work station on the podium, piping video to San Francisco from Menlo Park via two specially leased TV links, and projecting video images of mixed camera views and computer displays on an 18-foot screen. In the course of the session, we made considerable use of direct, shared-screen collaboration between me (on the podium at the conference) and different of my staff in our laboratory at Menlo Park.<br><br>In the following years, we added some basic features to further facilitate collaboration. We also concentrated heavily upon system architecture to facilitate the subsequent evolution of a <b>coherent</b> \"knowledge <b>workshop</b>\", with a command-language interface providing consistency and easy expansion, and a general facility for inclusion of \"foreign\" application systems as <b>workshop</b> tools even if they are programmed in other languages, or run in other computers under other operating systems.<br><br>By 1974, after eleven years of evolution, a considerably matured NLS was running under TENEX on a DEC PDP-10, and we initiated a subscription service to make this system available to user organizations. Computer service was supplied by a dedicated PDP-10, owned, maintained and operated by a commercial facilities-management company, on their premises, under contract to us at SRI. We had mostly government clients who used the ARPANET for access communication. We conceived of this as our \"Knowledge Workshop Utility service,\" providing a coordinated set of tools to <b>support</b> knowledge workers. We also emphasized personal <b>support</b> through field trainers and application consultants.<br><br>It may seem strange for a not-for-profit research institute to have fielded a commercial-grade service, but from a larger-system research viewpoint it was the only option: if we wanted to pursue significant augmentation results, it was absolutely necessary to have a community of real-world users. Within the whole augmentation-system domain, there are to be sure many significant technical problems remaining, but to my mind, by far the more numerous and challenging augmentation system problems lie in the human and organization domain -- to learn how to harness the services that technology offers, toward human ends. For this purpose it is necessary to have a significant number of people who are stably and skillfuly doing their everyday work with such tools, which requires in turn a solid, reliable set of computer-tool and people-<b>support</b> services.<br><br>In 1977, it was judged better to move the Utility-service and NLS-evolution activities out from the research-institute environment and into a suitable commercial environment. SRI advertised, entertained prospective bidders, made a selection, and negotiated a transfer of the business to TYMSHARE, Inc., of Cupertino, California. The system has been renamed AUGMENT, and is being marketed as part of TYMSHARE's integrated Office Automation services. Following is a brief outline of the features and services as brought over into that marketplace, organized under application areas of most relevance to the engineering-management theme of this conference.<br><br>DOCUMENT PRODUCTION<br><br>Almost all phases of any simple to complex document production process may be accomplished using AUGMENT. These include initial text entry by authors or by typists, editing, draft reviews (optionally printed-out), spelling correction, generation of tables of contents and indices, word counts, draft and final formatting (with provisions for graphics), routing for approvals, final proofing, printing or processing for photocomposition, and online filing (with electronic mail delivery optional).<br><br></div><div id='full_2'><mark>AUGMENT features for document production include:<br><br>\tPowerful text editing, for example:<br><br>\t\tDisplay and hardcopy terminals<br>\t\tMouse and keyset (optional) for added efficiency<br>\t\tVery large set of integrated commands (tools)<br>\t\tCommands in logically grouped subsets<br>\t\tParagraphs (statements) as structural entities<br>\t\tHierarchically-structured files<br>\t\tFlexible file view presentations: level and line clipping<br>\t\tEasy cross-file editing<br>\t\tMulti-display window viewing<br>\t\tPowerful reference-linking<br>\t\tPlus many general features, such as:<br><br>\t\t\tFile privacy and integrity<br>\t\t\tOptional off-line text entry (also interfaces to other WP systems)<br>\t\t\tGeographically distributed user-access to AUGMENT system capabilities and working information through computer networks such as TYMNET and ARPANET<br>\t\t\tSpelling checking and correction<br>\t\t\tTables of contents<br>\t\t\tIndexing and word counts<br>\t\t\tPre-set and user-entered formatting<br>\t\t\tElectronic photocomposition<br>\t\t\tRemote collaboration during document development and production<br>\t\t\tDocument filing, control, and retrieval<br>\t\t\tCalculating<br>\t\t\tTable manipulation<br>\t\t\tSorting<br>\t\t\tMixed text and graphics<br>\t\t\tProofing<br>\t\t\tForms design and presentation for data entry<br><br>INTER-OFFICE COMMUNICATIONS<br><br>To complement AUGMENT's powerful document production capabilities, online messages or long documents may be transmitted through \"electronic mail\" facilities to other users of the system.</mark></div><div> There is also a unique \"shared screen\" feature where two remotely separated (e.g. across the country) users both can share in viewing and controlling the same screen image on their respective display stations while talking together on the telephone. These two capabilities, described in Reference (5), provide users with a very useful, new kind of \"dialogue <b>support</b> system\" that has the following features:<br><br>\tImmediate or delayed delivery of messages or references<br>\tIndividual or group distribution lists selected by the user<br>\tAction or information-copy specification<br>\tIdentification system for selecting distribution list data<br>\tTitle, special comment, author, clerk, descriptors, and other document-related information capture, transmission, and filing<br>\tPermanent filing of all messages and document for later retrieval<br>\tForwarding of items to additional recipients<br>\tIndices of public items by number, author, and title keywords, for online access or hardcopy printout<br>\tAutomatic indexing of individual recipients' mail by date<br>\tEntry of references to hardcopy documents for information and control purposes<br><br>PERSONAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT<br><br>The foregoing features introduce many facilities and methods which are very effective for other applications as well, such as the management of an individual's day-to-day personal, working information. This value is particularly dependent upon the level of usage. When access to the AUGMENT system occurs regularly, preferably daily, a user can keep items such as reminders, agendas, <b>calendars</b>, notes, telephone numbers, and to-do lists structured as he or she prefers within AUGMENT files. When these are coordinated with documents being written, electronic mail transactions, and access to other database information, most of an individual's daily business can be aided by use of the AUGMENT system.<br><br>ORGANIZATIONAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT<br><br>The document production and electronic mail features outlined above bring useful new capabilities into the <b>office</b>. The emphasis in those applications is on free textual information where the structural nodes are paragraphs, headings, citations, names, and addresses, etc. These may be retrieved by scanning text \"pages\" while viewing different levels in the hierarchy, or by searching for strings of text.<br><br>There is also <b>support</b> for more structured approaches to information management. Flexible data structures can be defined using the basic features of AUGMENT where retrieval may be accomplished in a number of ways. Retrievals are aided by designating text strings as the \"names\" of nodes during the creation of such data bases. Special file searching is provided on these names, and their use for labeling data elements provides a simple means for organizing linked and structured data files with relatively rapid retrieval.<br><br>A special form of organizational entity where AUGMENT can be of significant value is an \"engineering community\" (6). Instead of being a <b>coherent</b> element in a monolithic, hierarchical organization, a community (in this sense of the word) is composed of elements from a number of such organizations, where community membership is established by being in a common discipline or a common mission. Examples: a community of groups each of whom is involved in some aspect of solar-power R&D; or a community of groups all of whom have inter-related responsibilities within a large project (members all may belong to scattered elements within one organization, or there may be many members from different organizations).<br><br>SOFTWARE ENGINEERING<br><br>AUGMENT provides an exceptional environment for the development and maintenance of large software systems (7). The basic features discussed above are directly applicable to generating and managing the texts of specifications, source code, program libraries, and all levels of system documentation.<br><br>It should be noted that the hierarchical organization of AUGMENT's text files, the flexible level-clipping view control, and the built-in labelling features for paragraphs (statements) naturally <b>support</b> structured programming practices in a uniquely effective manner. [Under Air Force sponsorship, IBM conducted an evaluative study of NLS (AUGMENT) as a <b>support</b> system for their structured-program methodology (8). From the report's Abstract: \"This unique combination of capabilities can contribute positively to improved <b>productivity</b> and product reliability in programming development.\"]<br><br>There has also been continual evolution of debugging aids coordinated with the rest of the software <b>engineer's</b> \"<b>workshop</b>\" (9). With his <b>workshop</b> on Machine A, he has means for applying his full range of debugging tools in a uniform manner to debug processes on distant machines -- including distributed processes that pass control from one machine to another. These processes can be running in mixed types of machines, under mixed types of operating systems, and can be programmed in mixed types of programming languages.<br><br>EVOLUTION AND OTHER-SYSTEM INTEGRATION<br><br>Perhaps the most important aspects of the system's design are (a) flexible provision for evolution, and (b) the ability to interface \"through\" AUGMENT to other systems while retaining a consistent user interface style. The underlying system of AUGMENT is designed to allow for all of a user's different data bases and application-program services to be integrated into one, <b>coherent</b> \"knowledge <b>workshop</b>\" (10). A Command Language Interpreter, operating upon the compiled \"grammars\" from descriptions written in a Command Meta Language, provides unique uniformity and flexibility in the user interface over a wide variety of application systems (new or old) (11) (12).<br><br>There are internal provisions for a user's commands to evoke \"reach-through\" operations to other systems that may run on another machine, and/or run under a different operating system, and/or be programmed in a different language (13). Using the internal services of AUGMENT as his \"home workplace\" for preparing data or queries and for integrating remotely retrieved or processed data, a user may do a large share of the work related to other-system use within a familiar environment where fast, flexible study and manipulation are constantly used skills, and where special design attention has been given to the process of integrating information of varied form and source into working plans, reports, etc.<br><br>HIGH PAYOFF FOR LARGE ENGINEERING PROJECTS<br><br>In a \"joint, engineering and management\" domain, the potential payoff of comprehensive, integrated <b>office</b> <b>automation</b> systems would seem extraordinarily large when applied in a whole-system fashion to the <b>support</b> of large projects. Here, a strong element of VALUE ADDED consideration is introduced -- in this kind of application, there are significant NEW WAYS FOR PROFESSIONALS TO DO THEIR WORK.<br><br>As individuals, the planners, designers, documenters, <b>managers</b>, or expediters will find considerable <b>support</b> for their particular types of work -- as will the secretaries and clerks in the individual-work part of their <b>support</b> roles. But it is the impact at the organizational level, particularly for the distributed \"community\" form, where the special payoff will seem most dramatic.<br><br>Besides the basic capabilities outlined above, there have been developed special AUGMENT sybsystems directly relevant to <b>support</b> of an engineering community: for financial and technical management of multi-project programs; for developing, maintaining, and querying directories of people and resources within a large community; for producing highly formatted and indexed, quality-publication \"handbooks\" from the directory information; and for cataloging, indexing, and controlling an extensive collection of hard-copy items (documents, letters, catalogs, clippings, etc.).<br><br>And new subsystems are under development to add special <b>support</b> for: calendar management; large-program budget development and review; large-program requisition generation and control; and reach-through services to other-machine data-base management systems.<br><br>The capability is directly available to connect AUGMENT to existing special systems for <b>support</b>ing design, analysis, testing and manufacturing, integrating these tools smoothly into the <b>engineer's</b> \"<b>coherent</b> <b>workshop</b>.\"<br><br>For instance, selected diagrams, curves, and tables generated from these systems can be automatically integrated into an <b>engineer's</b> AUGMENT files as \"illustrations\" in his \"engineering notebooks\" -- instead of his pasting photographs or plotter sheets into a binder. Besides providng for flexible studying and evolution of the individual's \"notebook,\" the system enables flexible remote collaboration in developing plans, analyzing results, etc. And it is subsequently an easy matter to assemble selected components from this record for outputting through graphic printers to produce mixed, text-graphic documents (drafts, or high-quality productions).<br><br>A similar situation exists for <b>managers</b> within the large project: a valuable set of tools within AUGMENT providing a powerful \"home workplace\" with many special services to <b>support</b> the manager role; a capability for reaching through to other systems (e.g., PERT, IMS) and for integrating their products into the home workplace; and the multi-form means for communicating within the <b>coherent</b>, community working domain.<br><br>CONCLUSION<br><br>It is extremely important to note the multiple levels of synergism at work here:<br><br>The synergistic effect of integrating many tools into one <b>coherent</b> <b>workshop</b> makes each tool of considerable more value than if it were used alone -- for instance, the value of teleconferencing is very much greater when the participants are already doing a large proportion of their everyday work on line, so that any of the working material is available for selective citing and accessing, and when the users are already at home with the basic techniques of preparing and studying on-line material and of organizing and finding related passages.<br><br>And at another level, the synergistic effect of integrating many augmented individuals into one <b>coherent</b> community makes each element of augmentation of considerable more value than if it were applied just to <b>support</b> its one indiviual -- this is derived from the collaborative communication capabilities as applied through extended organizational methods to integrate the augmented capabilities of individuals into augmented teams and communities.<br><br>And finally, for any application of significant power -- of which augmentation of an enginnering project would be a good example -- the adaptability and evolutionary flexibility of the computer-communication system is extremely important. The working methods of individuals will shift markedly as they settle into use of a comprehensive <b>workshop</b>, and with these new methods and skills will come payoff potential for changes and additions to their <b>workshop</b>s -- a cycle that will be significantly active for many years to come. A similar cycle will be even more dramatically evident at the organizational level.<br><br>An evolutionary approach seems the only viable alternative when the effects of a prospective change are not well known; and for many years to come this will be the case relative to the impacts of significant, prospective steps in <b>office</b> <b>automation</b> upon the operations of our organizations. We have an immense amount to learn about how people can better harness their basic capabilities toward individual and organizational ends.<br><br>It will be a long time before there is developed a stable framework within which to (a) design large next-step augmentation increments, or (b) plan an orderly transition for an organization that would adopt a large increment in one, discrete step.<br><br>Evolution of the service system, evolution of the indivual's working life, and evolution of the organization's working mode -- all must be provided for if an organization wants to capitalize significantly upon the potential of the technology that is arriving.<br></div>",

Cupertino, CA <br>29-Sep-82 19:26-PDT (AUGMENT,81010,)<br><br>INTRODUCTION<br><br>Among the on-line <b>knowledge</b> <b>workers</b> of tomorrow, there will be found as always a wide distribution both in personal motivation and flexibility, and in organizational roles and responsibility levels. In this view of the future, two things stand out for me: the workstations and work products of all of the <b>workers</b> must be inter-connected; and special roles for high-<b>performance</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>workers</b> within this inter-linked organizational and informational network will be extremely important. This paper outlines a framework stemming from this perception toward developing high-<b>performance</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>workers</b> as part of the evolutionary strategy of a <b>knowledge</b> organization.<br><br>In the early 60's when I began active, funded research in this area, well before the term \"Office Automation\" had emerged, I referred to my work as \"Augmenting the Human Intellect.\" (References [1] and [2] summarize events and results for me and my co-<b>workers</b> over the intervening years.)<br><br>About ten years ago I re-named our pursuit, after reading Peter Drucker's discussions [3] about \"<b>knowledge</b> <b>workers</b>,\" \"<b>knowledge</b> organizations,\" and \"<b>knowledge</b> industries.\" It seemed that a better term for the work would be \"Augmenting the Knowledge Worker.\" From this new perspective, a natural image emerged of a \"Knowledge Workshop\" as the place where a <b>knowledge</b> worker does his work and where, if we extended his <b>tools</b>, his means of collaborative communication, his working methods and his organizational roles, we could speak of an \"Augmented Knowledge Workshop.\"<br><br>WORKSHOP ARCHITECTURE<br><br>General Features<br><br>It seems inevitable that, as depicted in Figure 1, there will be a combination of local, high-speed networking (Electronic PBX and Local-Area Network) together with higher-level networks (private and public) which will interconnect workstations and the many <b>tools</b> and services within an organization's whole workshop. The effect will be as though there is a giant communication bus, where some elements seem far away (i.e. a slow or expensive communication path) and some seem very close (i.e. a fast and cheap communication path).<br><br>Figure-1. The workstations, computers and data bases for most large organizations will look something like this, and will connect to the outside world via at least one public network.<br><br>For the purposes of this discussion, let us put aside concerns for how much processing power and storage capacity should be built into the workstation, or where any particular programs or data should reside.<br><br>Let us instead consider the following principles, relative to supporting high-<b>performance</b> <b>workers</b> and integrating their capabilities into the larger organization:<br><br>Their workstations should have access to many <b>tools</b> and services, assumedly provided by a number of distributed sources around this network, including both those newly implemented and those that have long existed and will be slow to disappear.<br><br>The collection of <b>tools</b> and services for each worker must be integrated into a coherent whole into his \"augmented <b>knowledge</b> workshop.\"<br><br>Each worker should have access his full complement of <b>tools</b>, services, and personal working files from other workstations away from home base, even across the country so he can carry on with his work wherever he happens to be. (It would be a silly rejection of available communication technology to do otherwise.)<br><br>This whole arrangement must provide pragmatically for continuing evolution of command language, tool and service functions, <b>terminal</b> hardware, processor horsepower, application packages and their support computers, etc.<br><br>(See Reference [4] for a full development of such principles, and for the foundations for the architecture described below.)<br><br>Basic Organization of the Architecture<br><br>The over-all architectural approach that we adopted has four major components, as shown in Figure 2and summarized below. They are all operational today as part of Tymshare's AUGMENT system.<br><br>A User Interface System (UIS) to handle the interface between the user's <b>terminal</b> and the interactive programs. (References [5] and [6] provide a detailed description of the implementation and utilization of the UIS.)<br><br>The UIS takes care of all command-language dialog and all connection protocols. It also provides a uniform interface between the tool and the <b>terminal</b> to ensure that the user will (as nearly as possible) get the same treatment on a variety of <b>terminal</b>s.<br><br>Figure-2. A user at a given <b>terminal</b> will \"see\" this kind of connection, looking \"through\" his UIS at his \"local workplace\" and beyond to the other, special <b>tools</b> that may be located anywhere on a connected network.<br><br>It interacts with an individual's user-profile file, to provide interface styles tailored to the needs and preferences of that individual.<br><br>It provides a reach-through service to non-AUGMENT systems, and can optionally translate between the command language of a <b>foreign</b>-program <b>modules</b> and a command language designed to meet the user's particular needs. The user's command languages as translated for a number of different \"<b>foreign</b>\" systems can be designed for mutual consistency, to provide an important coherence in language and function.<br><br>It provides an adaptation to different <b>terminal</b> characteristics, allowing users to access their work from different <b>terminal</b>s, and enabling application programmers to develop their software as though it were to serve a <b>virtual</b> <b>terminal</b>.<br><br>A Procedure-Call Protocol (PCP) to provide for effective communication between processes on the network. (Reference [7] gives a thorough, detailed treatment of this \"PCP approach\".)<br><br>This protocol makes possible the implementation in each host of an application-independent, network run-time environment making remote resources accessible at the functional level essentially as though via a procedure call within a one-host application system. It greatly enhances the application programmer's flexibility; makes remote resources usefully accessible to other programs (not just to human users); significantly eases the problems of evolutionary changes within the network; and immensely improves the flexibility with which <b>tools</b> and services can be provided to the user.<br><br>A Core Workshop the user's own \"Local Workplace,\" a basic collection of <b>tools</b> and services that a <b>knowledge</b> worker generally needs, regardless of his professional specialty.<br><br>The user feels that this is his \"office,\" where in a familiar, consistent and effective environment he can do most of his editing, studying, information management, mail management, etc. The AUGMENT Backend was designed to provide these core functions (and in addition has many features which reward a practised user with significant gains in speed and flexibility).<br><br>The model in the user's mind is that he does most of his work here, and will \"reach through\" this \"home workshop\" to access other <b>tools</b> and services. There is special payoff for effective, flexible capabilities in this core workshop, where the user will spend a large proportion of his on-line time and can steadily acquire more of the available techniques toward higher <b>performance</b>.<br><br>Other Special Tools with their own file conventions, operating systems, etc.<br><br>A rich and ever-growing mix of data bases, application programs and special services will want to be \"reachable\" in a coherent manner by ever-more of the <b>knowledge</b> <b>workers</b> in a larger organization especially the higher-<b>performance</b> <b>workers</b>. It is important to support the evolutionary integration of these services into coherent, composite <b>tools</b> systems. AUGMENT's implementation enables application-support programmers easily to provide customized mixes of function and command terminology for special classes of users even for an individual user.<br><br>The general case, to be expected and probably encouraged, will find a variety of different hardware elements (<b>terminal</b>s, personal computers, minis and large main frames, etc.) and a mix of software (different vintages, vendors, file conventions, terminology, user languages, help conventions, etc.).<br><br>Elements of the User Interface System4c<br><br>In Figure 3 are shown the main software <b>modules</b> (circles, ellipses) and support-file items (rectangles) involved when the User Interface System supports a user's access to a tool that is adapted for direct, \"procedure call\" service. The AUGMENT Backend is designed this way, and can work with full capability when the UIS and the Backend are separated by a network connection. This is true for any application system that has a procedure-call interface, regardless of the programming language and run-time environment, providing a suitable PCI module is implemented in its host computer to translate between the PCP and the particular procedure-call protocol for that application system.<br><br>Figure-3. When using the Procedure Call Protocol to interact with a <b>backend</b> tool, the User Interface System (UIS) will employ three special software <b>modules</b> and three special control files.<br><br>The main UIS module is the Command Language Interpreter (CLI), interpreting each action by the user and responding with screen-action feedback or calls to the Backend <b>tools</b> for service, according to the particular Command Language in effect.<br><br>There are likely to be many UIS-Grammar files lying around, each being a compact, specially coded specification of a particular Command Language. When attached to the CLI, a particular Grammar file determines the command terms and the feedback on the <b>terminal</b> screen, as well as the service-call and data-transfer interaction with the Backend <b>tools</b>.<br><br>For any given user, there will be one User Profile file attached to the UIS to specify the particular set of options which that user desires in the action of the CLI e.g. style of command recognition, amount and type of feedback, formatting defaults, initialization status, escape-code assignments to particular keys, etc.<br><br>It is an administrative decision whether or not a particular user is provided with commands for changing his profile file.<br><br></div><div id='full_3'><mark>The Virtual Terminal Controller (VTC) module lets the rest of the UIS operate as though serving a standard, \"<b>virtual</b>\" <b>terminal</b>, translating back and forth to/from the signals of whatever \"actual\" <b>terminal</b> is connected.</mark></div><div><br><br>The characteristics of the particular <b>terminal</b> are packed into the special \"Terminal Characteristic\" file one such for each different type of <b>terminal</b> that may be interfaced. For most of the modern <b>terminal</b>s, this file is selected and installed automatically from interactions between the UIS and the <b>terminal</b>.<br><br></div><div id='full_4'><mark>The UIS Process Communication Interface (PCI) allows the CLI to interact with the Backend <b>tools</b> making service requests and receiving the results as though it were making sub-routine calls in a \"<b>virtual</b>\" application-system environment.</mark></div><div><br><br></div><div id='full_2'><mark>In the general case, the UIS PCI would translate the UIS signals back and forth to/from a \"universal procedure-call protocol\" suitable for network interchange; a particular Backend tool (application system) would employ a version of the PCI that translates in turn back and forth to/from that tool's internally employed procedure-call protocol.</mark></div><div><br><br>Foreign-System Reach-Through4d<br><br>Figure 4 shows the special provision for reaching through to \"<b>foreign</b>\" systems that do not provide a procedure-call interface i.e. systems that can only be utilized by character-stream I/O as from a <b>terminal</b>. The Reach-Through Interface is a special module that can be programmed for the specific character-stream interactions of a given tool for eliciting from the tool the equivalent results as expected by each procedure call sent to that tool by the CLI.<br><br>Figure-4. When interacting with a <b>backend</b> tool not equipped for procedure-call interaction, the UIS can employ either programmed interaction via its Reach-Through Interface (RTI), or provide the user with a direct, transparent connection.<br><br></div><div id='full_0'><mark>In such a case, the UIS can interact with the Backend tool as though it (the UIS) were a <b>terminal</b> effectively translating between the CLI and the flow of characters back and forth to/from the tool, to call for service and to receive the results.</mark></div><div><br><br>Seemingly inefficient, yet this \"programmed-interaction\" reach-through mode provides for an effective translation between the command language of that <b>foreign</b> tool and the UIS Command Language where the latter may be designed with verbs and nouns etc. to fit the special usage and to be compatible with the rest of the grammar, vocabulary, and conceptual-model characteristics designed to serve this class of users as their coherent <b>knowledge</b> workshop.<br><br>This enables the coherent integration of many older systems, many of which will live on for years.<br><br></div><div id='full_1'><mark>As an alternative mode of interacting with a <b>foreign</b> system through its <b>terminal</b> I/O, the UIS can connect the <b>foreign</b>-system link directly to the Virtual Terminal Controller (VTC) to provide interaction as though the UIS were \"transparent.\"</mark></div><div><br><br>Shared-Screen Conferencing<br><br>Figure 5 shows an interconnection mode, between two instances of UIS <b>modules</b>, whereby both <b>terminal</b>s can share the screen content of one of them. Each VTC module converts the <b>virtual</b>-<b>terminal</b> screen image to the correct form for its connected <b>terminal</b>, so this shared-screen conferencing will work for dissimilar <b>terminal</b>s.<br><br>Figure-5. When employing their respective UISs in the shared-screen conferencing connection, two or more users can collaborate closely on whatever job the \"showing user\" has going.<br><br>This mode is established in response to a suitable set of commands by the participants, and in principle any number of users can have such a connection made to their UIS <b>modules</b> so that User A can in real time show the dynamic workings of his screen to them all -- no matter what command language and tool system he is using.<br><br>At his option, User A can pass control to User B, thereafter what everyone watches are the effects of commands from User B's <b>terminal</b> and VTC acting through User A's CLI upon A's active jobs and files.<br><br>In its usual employment, this conferencing mode is used in conjunction with simultaneous telephone dialog. It will work between any two users connected by a network path. (Reference [8] gives a fairly complete description of an earlier form of this \"shared-screen teleconferencing.\")<br><br>THE OVER-ALL AUGMENTATION SYSTEM<br><br>The Categories of System Elements<br><br>Here, from my framework, are the major elements involved in \"augmenting\" our <b>knowledge</b> <b>workers</b> and their organizations. For this purpose, a \"craftsman\" metaphor seems directly applicable -- considering that our <b>knowledge</b> <b>workers</b> must be very much the professional <b>craftsmen</b>.<br><br>A. Tools: Craftsmen benefit from balanced collections of well-designed <b>tools</b><br><br>B. Methods: To be effective, <b>tools</b> must be used with well-polished work methods<br><br>C. Skills: It takes practised skill to exercise a competent blend of tool and method<br><br>D. Knowledge: True <b>craftsmen</b> depend upon much integrated \"shop\" <b>knowledge</b><br><br>E. Language of the Craft: Craftsmen need an effective language to discuss, teach, plan and collaborate among themselves (i.e. to do their \"shop talk\").<br><br>F. Training: To develop an effective group of <b>craftsmen</b> in a planned way requires explicit training, in all of the above elements<br><br>G. Organization: Role differentiation and organizational structure are necessary for integrating <b>craftsmen</b> effectively into an organization.<br><br>Tool System and Human System<br><br>For discussion sake, call Category A the \"Tool System\" and the aggregate of Categories B through G the \"Human System.\" We can immediately note that new technology, no matter how dramatic, contributes directly only to the Tool System.<br><br>Over the centuries there has been an immense amount of invention involved in the cultural evolution that brought the Human System to its present state. But its evolution took place with what will have to be described as a very primitive Tool System.<br><br>To take advantage of the absolutely radical, emerging Tool-System inventions, it is inevitable that evolution of the Human-System will begin to accelerate. In my view, this is strongly to be encouraged, since the power derived from the Tool System can only come from the way it is harnessed to human endeavors via the Human System.<br><br>Co-Evolution<br><br>The optimum design for either the Tool System or the Human System is dependent upon the match it must make with the other. There is a high degree of mutual dependence. But it seems that the Tool System is or soon will be \"out of control\" in the sense of our being able to design its target state, say for five years hence. And we possibly never will know how to \"design\" this Human System. So to be pragmatic about it, we can at best work in a \"guided-evolution\" mode for each of the sub-systems.<br><br>So, the ultimate capability of the larger \"Augmentation System,\" and therefore the <b>performance</b> level of the <b>knowledge</b> <b>workers</b> and <b>knowledge</b> organizations of the future, will improve only through the co-evolution of these two sub-systems. A disastrous default mode would be for the perceptions of the technologists and the market-oriented product planners to steer the evolution of the Tool System, and leave the Human System to adapt in its trail. There is no practical worry that the evolution of the Human System will drive that of the Tool System; it is inconceivable that the Human System could be served by analysts, inventors and entrepreneurs with the same fierce intensity as for the Tool System.<br><br>The practical worry is that there won't be enough perception of payoff from investing in explicit, conscious invention and evolution in the Human System, and that we will drift toward the above default mode.<br><br>It is something of a bind -- our culture hasn't really developed an acceptance for cultural progress to anywhere near the extent it has for progress in the technological and material sense -- and without a solid perception and acceptance that conscious evolution of such as this Human System (primarily a cultural matter) will pay off, we are not likely to become particularly effective at it. So it would seem that we need to invest an extra degree of attention and resource toward developing the perception that this Human System is not only acceptable but has a very high payoff. THEN we probably could get moving toward a balanced co-evolution.<br><br><br>SO, WHY TALK ABOUT HIGH-PERFORMANCE KNOWLEDGE WORKERS<br><br>There is a first-order answer to this question. It makes sense, at least from my viewpoint, to aim for a balanced distribution among the <b>knowledge</b> <b>workers</b> in an organization, in terms of the level of <b>knowledge</b>-work <b>performance</b> targeted for different roles. In this view then, a certain proportion of research, development and implementation investment should be made toward making really significant improvements. This would involve special attention for such roles, over both the Tool System and the Human System.<br><br>And there is also a very important, second-order answer. The most effective strategy that I can think of, toward developing the perception and acceptance of \"progress\" in the Human System, is to invest in pursuit of truly high-<b>performance</b> for selected <b>knowledge</b>-work roles. The best roles for this purpose would be those that would expose important stakeholders to the EXPERIENCE of truly high <b>performance</b>, by BEING THERE when that high <b>performance</b> is being exercised on activities relevant to their workaday world.<br><br>As a general strategy then, we would aim for specially equipped and trained teams to be connected into the workshop networks of large organizations, to perform roles that lend themselves best to early pursuit of especially high <b>performance</b>, and where there would be an appropriate visibility, identification, and sense of relevance for the organization's trend setters.<br><br><br>CONCLUSIONS<br><br>We can reasonably hypothesize that a startling degree of improvement may be obtained in the <b>performance</b> level of <b>knowledge</b> organizations and their individual <b>knowledge</b> <b>workers</b>. And further, that in order to obtain this we must attend to changes in both the Tool System and the Human System.<br><br>If this hypothesis were to be proven valid, it would be of immense importance for a problem-laden society to have acted on it. It doesn't seem that we would have to risk much to test it out over the next decade. A very small proportion of what is being invested in the \"easy to learn\" level of Office Automation, if explicitly directed toward pursuing high augmented-human <b>performance</b>, would have a notable effect.<br><br>Architectural features such as described above seem necessary anyway to support the natural evolution of Office Automation, even without any special emphasis upon high-<b>performance</b> <b>workers</b>. A salient point is that these features also can support the accelerated evolution of individuals and groups, who can still work effectively with the rest of the organization, but where through their own efforts or through planned investment by the larger organization they have extended more rapidly than the rest the development of their augmentation categories -- <b>tools</b>, methods, skills, etc.<br><br>And what is also important about these features is that they provide for the harmonious co-existence, within the same organizational environment, of <b>knowledge</b> <b>workers</b> of all levels of <b>performance</b>. The high-<b>performance</b> organization of the next decade must make do with many degrees of aspiration, talent and training, and must accommodate a wide spectrum in its <b>workers</b>' <b>performance</b> levels.<br><br>And it is also important to note that architectural characteristics of the organization's <b>knowledge</b> workshop will have a notable effect upon the co-evolution rate of that can be achieved.<br><br><br>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS <br><br>The concepts and the system described above have evolved over more than two decades, greatly aided by the research sponsorship of a number of organizations. Until 1978, at SRI International, research sponsorship by The Air Force Office of Scientific Research provided three years of critical conceptualization and planning support, from '59 through '62; DARPA's Information Processing Techniques Office, NASA, and the Air Force RADC contributed significantly until 1978, when SRI sold its rights to the system to Tymshare, Inc. There, while bringing it into the commercial market, the company has supported further conceptual and development work. During this more than two decades, probably a hundred different people have contributed directly, very significantly affecting the architecture and its implementation, and probably even affecting the way I see these things.<br><br></div>",

(The attached <b>reprint</b>, Ref1, summarizes events and results over this period.) I re-named the pursuit about ten years ago, after reading Peter Drucker's discussions (Ref-2) about \"<b>knowledge</b> <b>workers</b>,\" \"<b>knowledge</b> organizations,\" and \"<b>knowledge</b> industries.\" I decided that a better term would be \"Augmenting the Knowledge Worker.\" </div><div id='full_1'><mark>And, from that perspective, a natural image emerged of a \"Knowledge Workshop\" as the place where a <b>knowledge</b> worker does his work -- and where, if we extended his tools, his means of collaborative communication, his working methods and his <b>organizational</b> roles, we could speak of an \"Augmented Knowledge Workshop.\"</mark></div><div><br><br>As to be expected, my <b>viewpoint</b> has steadily evolved over the years: many inter-related concepts and elements gradually settled into an ever-more comprehensive and consistent framework. In recent years, my pursuit has often been identified as belonging in the emergent fields of Office Automation and The Office of The Future. In a generally useful way, this is true enough. But there are frequent, large differences -- mostly stemming from differences in <b>viewpoint</b>. I think the major difference is that I have come to sense a much larger <b>scale</b> of opportunity and probable impact than I originally did. This paper attempts to summarize those aspects of my framework that relate to this issue of <b>scale</b>.<br><br>UNDERLYING CONCEPTS<br><br>My own perception of potential gain in human capability didn't clarify until I realized how pervasive and extensive were the things that our cultural evolution had already developed to augment our basic human capabilities. For me these developments boiled down to three main <b>categories</b> of \"cultural invention\":<br><br>Language -- how we conceptualize, attach labels and symbols, externalize, portray, model, communicate, ...<br><br>Artifacts -- physical gadgets -- tools, instruments, crutches, ...<br><br>Methodology -- procedures, methods, ways to organize people and resources, ...<br><br>For completeness, I found that I needed two other ingredients to fill out a \"whole augmentation system.\"<br><br>Skills and <b>knowledge</b> required for humans to harness these inventions (a matter of training);<br><br>Attitudes, spirit, beliefs, etc. required to make the system work (a matter of indoctrination).<br><br>Note that new technology, no matter how dramatic, contributes directly only to the Artifact category. Also, consider the immense amount of invention that over the centuries has been integrated into the other <b>categories</b> of our <b>knowledge</b>-worker Augmentation System.<br><br>So, if it isn't new to be bringing technology into our Augmentation System, what then will be so remarkable about introducing the new, computer-communication technology?<br><br>Consider the four, non-technology <b>categories</b> as comprising a \"cultural system, into which an immense amount of invention over the centuries has been integrated. Its scope, complexity and ingenuity transcend those of any system we humans know how to develop by explicit design, and engender within me a great respect for the effectiveness of \"organic\" cultural evolution.<br><br>For me then, much of the answer to the above question came from from one particularly important realization which emerged from this conceptual approach: elements within these different <b>categories</b> have a great deal of mutual affect upon one another's evolution; an innovation in the Artifacts category has almost always produced changes in the Cultural System <b>categories</b> -- such side-effect changes will usually follow as a natural means of taking full advantage of the initial innovation's potential.<br><br>When one considers the number and degree of the changes which this emergent technology can fruitfully introduce into our Artifact category, their quantitative effect portends a <b>qualitative</b> impact of unprecedented degree upon the whole, five-part Augmentation System.<br><br>Perhaps this is too sketchily presented -- but this type of conceptualization has been very important in shaping my <b>viewpoint</b>. A detailed treatment of these and other relevant concepts is presented in (Ref-3), also (Ref-4). For me, they are gaining in validity and significance every year, and still support very well the growing framework within which I perceive the possibilities and payoffs of augmentation.<br><br>A QUICK SKETCH<br><br>My <b>viewpoint</b> seems persistently to highlight the amount of <b>organizational</b> evolution that will have to be accommodated in the coming decades. This section provides some substantive imagery toward understanding what is in my mind in that regard. (These things are at the heart of what we have been working at for fifteen years.)<br><br>Consider a few of the things that the <b>knowledge</b>-worker professional (KW-Professional) must learn to do within his augmented workshop:<br><br>compose, study and modify the proposals, memoranda, plans, budgets, etc. that are his products; [Note: \"Study\" means much more to us than \"read.\"]<br><br>find earlier drafts and compare them with a current one;<br><br>send, receive, and keep track of his electronic mail;<br><br>solicit comments from his colleagues about a draft plan, then keep track of the comments and their cited passages;<br><br>manage his \"office-full\" of computer-held files, notes, lists, mail, reference pieces (e.g. office procedures, contract specs, or etc. against which he must work).<br><br>Consider also a <b>knowledge</b>-worker support person (KW-Support) -- tomorrow's secretary, stenographer, records manager, documentation specialist, staff assistant, etc.<br><br>Much of their support work will involve the same assortment of basic operations as for the KW-Professional above;<br><br>and we can expect special value in their supportive assistance to be derived from their being skilled in the application of specialized computer services (e.g. data-base querying and analysis, graphic-portrayal developing, copy editing, quality-document typography, etc.).<br><br>Now consider a type of support from this technology that generally doesn't get much appreciation -- a much-enhanced means for close collaboration among distributed <b>workers</b>. Here is what current technology can provide in this respect:<br><br>Fast, flexible electronic mail/messages: Where it is easy to formulate a short note, selectively including passages from other files, and distribute it to selected people. With a full mail service, one can send entire documents this way -- including graphic illustrations. A very useful option is to have a document or message be assigned a permanent accession number and then be stored in an official archive where subsequent access is guaranteed under that accession number.<br><br>Sharable work spaces: One's working records, notes, plans, etc. can selectively be made accessible to others with a new kind of flexibility and visibility. For example, a common occurrence is to send off a short, quick message saying, \"Check my passage in (Jones, Draft-Plan, 3B) to see if it meets the objections you expressed in (27143,6A5).\" [The first citation being to a specific passage in a private, working file; the second to a specific passage in a formally recorded, prior message or document.]<br><br>Shared-screen teleconferencing (Show-and-Tell Dialog): Consider two persons, working at a distance from one another, at their respective display screens (not necessarily the same brand of hardware, not necessarily working with the same computerized tools).<br><br>Assume that they are in telephone conversation and decide to shift to a more powerful dialog mode. Each of them elicits a conferencing set-up action from his computer, where for instance User A requests connection to User B for Showing, and User B requests connection to User A for Viewing.<br><br>Then on the screen at User B's workstation will be shown (as nearly as possible, depending upon the respective capabilities of their display equipment) what User A has on his screen. User B will be able to see what User A \"points\" to; User A can talk, point, and work in a normal fashion, doing a \"show and tell\" dialog with User B. At any time, User A can pass control to User B to reverse the flow of the show and tell dialog.<br><br>Assume that the interconnection processes for frequent collaborators can be preset for switching in and out of contact in a few seconds. Assume also that an almost arbitrary number of people can be connected into the conference hookup. Also, assume that there will be background, query-scheduling processes that can be used to facilitate the mutual arrangements that establish the time at which a conference session will be set up.<br><br>We can now appreciate that, besides the skills required by the Professional and Support persons to do their respective kinds of <b>knowledge</b> work, there will be a very important added set of skills -- how to interact closely in collaborating at a new level and degree of teamwork.<br><br>Consider how capabilities such as sketched above will affect the interplay between skilled professional specialists, and provide for the smooth integration of their respective contributions. Their \"group capability\" can be so much more flexible and efficient than ever before possible that we will have to re-consider our entire set of attitudes and beliefs about human teams or other <b>organizational</b> units -- about their possible working modes and potential effectiveness, about more-effective harnessing of special human talents, about extending the critical limits of complexity and urgency for the problems that human organizations can successfully handle.<br><br>All of the above-sketched scenario for an augmented organization is very real; more than this can in fact be supported with today's technology, and one assumes that tomorrow's offerings will at least provide as much.<br><br>QUESTIONS OF PERCEPTION<br><br>Here is a list of questions that are of special significance to my point of view:<br><br>What <b>scale</b> of gains do you see being derived from the adoption of this technology? (Productivity, capability, efficiency, performance, ... ?)<br><br>How much change will there be in the way we work? How much change will there be in skills and <b>knowledge</b> required for our jobs? How much time will you as an individual probably spend learning the new skills, <b>knowledge</b>, and ways of working?<br><br>How much change will there be within our organizations -- in structure, roles, and modes of interaction? How much time and cost will be involved in working out the major part of these <b>organizational</b> changes? How will this \"<b>organizational</b> cost\" compare with the cost of buying, installing and operating the new equipment?<br><br>This list suits me because of my particular <b>viewpoint</b> about the Office of the Future. I happen to believe (BELIEVE) that this is the start of a very large revolution -- bigger in <b>qualitative</b> impact than the combined effects of the printing press and the industrial revolution. In my view, the above gains and changes are going to be very (extremely) large. Please hold this in mind as you digest what I say.<br><br></div><div id='full_4'><mark>One way to help illustrate my <b>viewpoint</b> is to talk about \"high performance\" for <b>knowledge</b> <b>workers</b> and for <b>knowledge</b> organizations.</mark></div><div> This is what has lured me on for many years -- the image of a new, much-enhanced level of capability for individual <b>knowledge</b> <b>workers</b>, and of startling gains in effectiveness for our <b>knowledge</b> organizations. In my framework, I much prefer to talk of \"augmenting\" rather than \"automating\" our individuals and organizations, because the principle value to me is in extending our capability for human-directed <b>knowledge</b> work, rather than in churning out our invoices with production-line efficiency.<br><br>Maybe they aren't fair, but these rhetorical questions convey something of my feeling: From these opportunities, do you picture a more-efficient ox cart or a more-effective vehicle (e.g. a jeep)? A more-efficient tablet-cutting chisel or a more-effective graphic writer/copier (e.g. a printing press)?<br><br>As you can see, my primary concern would better be characterized as pursuit of the organization of the future rather than of the office of the future.<br><br></div><div id='full_0'><mark>ORGANIZATIONAL HILL CLIMBING<br><br>A useful metaphor, \"<b>hill</b> <b>climbing</b>.\"</mark></div><div> Each <b>knowledge</b> organization has to relocate itself, upwards through gradient lines of new skills, <b>knowledge</b>, methods and roles; struggling against the constant gravitational drag of uncertainty, the reaction to newness, the fatigue from unusual new exertions and postures, the false starts and wrong turns -- and the <b>climbing</b> energy can only come from within the organization..<br><br>In my view, the only feasible approach involves an explicitly chartered, full-time, internal <b>organizational</b> unit whose main work is to facilitate the organization's self-development. </div><div id='full_3'><mark>It provides planning, coaching in <b>hill</b>-<b>climbing</b> techniques, guiding, and general facilitation; but each of the other <b>organizational</b> units has to do its own scrambling and sweating to get its membership into a coherent new grouping up on the next level place.</mark></div><div><br><br>There will have to be exploratory groups that are the first to establish themselves at new levels on new parts of the <b>hill</b>; theirs will be much more difficult transitions than for the following groups, and the larger organization has to subsidize these exploratory probes as a general expense within its whole-organization evolutionary costs.<br><br>\"Prototype\" efforts seem so important; and they can't be done using minimal service systems. They have to be considered as an exploratory investment. And, consider that the process of conducting the first such <b>prototype</b> activities will constitute an exploratory investment in learning how to conduct <b>prototype</b> activities.<br><br>SOME SOME ADMONITIONS<br><br>Do assume that everybody in the <b>knowledge</b>-work community within your organization will have a terminal that is connected within an organization-wide network; that every terminal can be in touch with any other; that every <b>knowledge</b> worker will potentially make use of service elicited from access to almost any data base or any person or any computer process in the organization.<br><br>Do assume that your organization's internal network will have communication gateways to public networks -- and that almost every worker within the organization will benefit from some kind of service derived through these public networks.<br><br>Don't fight the idea of making changes in people's ways of thinking and working; look at it as an opportunity to expedite our evolution.<br><br>Don't buy on tight requirements -- i.e. don't buy from the position of \"I want exactly this, no more and no less.\" Leave expansion room.<br><br>Do assume that your organization will benefit from an explicit, conscious effort applied to the process of its evolution, for at least the next decade -- and get to work upon an initial, important bit of <b>organizational</b> evolution, the creation of an effective, internal \"evolutionary mechanism.\"<br><br>Do assume that the important part of the organization's evolution is the human part -- the changes in skills, <b>knowledge</b>, methods, roles and <b>organizational</b> structure. These elements take much longer to establish or change than do new hardware or software parts of the system. These latter should be employed to SUPPORT the human-system evolution and operation.<br><br>Do realize that your human system will be strongly affected (and limited) by the hardware-software systems you buy. It is all too easy to let system acquisition wag the dog.<br><br>Do realize that you can throw away a hardware-software system, and roll in a new one; yes, they all will become obsolete and you can't keep waiting for the best one. BUT, understand that the associated changes in the human system will really be the important factors in summing up the cost vs. payoff of junking System A and installing System B.<br><br>ON MATTERS OF SCALE<br><br>The <b>qualitative</b> aspects of essentially every phenomenon will change as associated parameters shift in <b>scale</b>. Engineers long ago learned that their <b>judgment</b> and intuition could be drastically in error when the <b>scale</b> would be shifted beyond a certain range. Bridges and buildings collapsed and a Spruce Goose couldn't fly. And in natural systems, too -- a flea can jump to heights dozens of times its own size, but it couldn't even walk if it were <b>scale</b>d up to the size of a human.<br><br>After watching the man-computer thing from close up, for nearly thirty years, I am convinced that the matter of <b>scale</b> is a critical factor. Our earlier capabilities for <b>judgment</b> and intuition about the nature and effects of projected change simply aren't going to be applicable.<br><br>On the one hand, things that will start to change about our ways of thinking and working will catch us by surprise -- in the framework within which we grew up, they just weren't candidates for being changed. Also, shifts in phenomena-scaling (number and degree of changes) are moving us into a <b>qualitative</b>ly different, whole-environment domain. For our intuition and <b>judgment</b> to continue serving us, they will have to be re-conditioned -- a process only accomplished by experience.<br><br>A PERSONAL FOCUS<br><br>I am turning my focus toward developing specially equipped and specially trained \"high-performance augmented teams.\" To produce examples and gain experience is the only way that I can see, today, to take on effective pursuit of the augmentation potential. A team, of from five to ten people, will serve as a <b>prototype</b> <b>organizational</b> model. Here, we can experiment with much higher levels of specialty skills and <b>knowledge</b>, and can work out effective modes of high-performance collaboration and new <b>organizational</b> roles. Conscious evolution in the whole-system character of a team can be carried out far more quickly and economically than with larger <b>organizational</b> units.<br><br></div><div id='full_2'><mark>I also aim to awaken interest in some larger organizations that want to begin developing internal mechanisms and experiences for establishing an effective mode of <b>organizational</b> evolution -- gearing up for the \"<b>hill</b> <b>climbing</b>.\"</mark></div><div> Lets say that they are willing to start investing now toward evolving into a \"high-performance organization.\" As our laboratory begins to turn out a succession of working-<b>prototype</b>, high-performance augmented teams, we will want them to find active use in support of real-life <b>organizational</b> needs. The participating organizations will serve an important role in helping establish the application targets, and in providing field-test environments and constructive feedback. There seems to be good likelihood that the applications for such teams can be selected to provide very effective facilitation of the organization's <b>hill</b>-<b>climbing</b> process -- a sort of \"bootstrapping\" strategy.<br><br>Much of the development and experience represented in the attached <b>reprint</b> will be used as a base. With the \"integrative and evolutionary\" character of AUGMENT, we can for instance attach the highest-quality terminal equipment, very easily extend the computer horsepower per worker, and in a straightforward matter bring almost any existing software into \"reach-through\" access. And for any-sized extension of functional capability, our User Interface System enables us very flexibly to extend the command language and evolve in a powerful and coherent manner.</div>",

Engelbart<br>Tymshare, Inc.<br>October 25, 1983<br>Journal Document (OAD,2221,) <br><br><br>INTRODUCTION<br><br>AUGMENT is an integrated system of knowledge-worker tools that originated at SRI International over an extended period under the sponsorship of NASA, DARPA and RADC. (The system was then named \"NLS.\") Commercial rights were transferred to Tymshare in 1978, where it has since been enhanced and marketed as an integrated Office Automation system. A short history of AUGMENT's development may be found in [Ref-1], along with a summary of system characteristics and features.<br><br>The system evolved on time-shared, mainframe computers, and in a packet-switched network environment. In 1970 our computer was the second to be attached to the ARPANET, and since 1978 we have also operated extensively in the TYMNET environment. Special attributes of each the timesharing and the network environments contribute uniquely to the <b>support</b> of <b>collaboration</b>.<br><br>The architecture and general character of AUGMENT were directly oriented toward <b>augmenting</b> the capability of humans to deal with tough knowledge work and to process effectively the large volumes of information that burden the modern office. An explicit sub-goal was to <b>support</b> close, active <b>collaboration</b> among groups of workers. In this spirit, we volunteered to develop and operate the Network Information Center (NIC) for the original ARPANET user and research community, aiming to learn about collaborative <b>support</b> by really doing it.<br><br>Below are listed the primary community activities which we aimed to <b>support</b> in providing \"coordinated information services for a discipline- or mission-oriented community\" -- shown in the order recommended for evolutionary implementation. The rationale for the selection and ordering of these particular activities, and the approach for providing computerized <b>support</b> for them, were described in [Ref-2]:<br><br>A1: Collaborative Dialog<br><br>A2: Document Development, Production, and Control<br><br>A3: Research Intelligence<br><br>A4: Community Handbook Development<br><br>A5: Computer-Based Instruction<br><br>A6: Meetings and Conferences<br><br>A7: Community Management and Organization<br><br>A8: Special Knowledge Work by Individuals and Teams<br><br>The range of services conceived for this purpose had a major effect upon the system architecture and user features. However, the ARPANET user community grew much faster than was planned for, so this range had to be trimmed considerably and much less exploratory <b>support</b> development was carried out than was planned for. As a consequence, it was only for the first two of these activities that enough resources were available for developing significant computerized <b>support</b>.<br><br>[Note: The NIC remained at SRI when the rest of the Augmentation Research Center left, and is healthily serving a very sizeable community.]<br><br>This paper summarizes some of the principles, concepts and special <b>provisions</b> embodied in AUGMENT that most directly provide this collaborative <b>support</b>.<br><br>SOME GENERAL PRINCIPLES<br><br>When considering an array of candidate <b>provisions</b> for <b>augmenting</b> a knowledge worker's capability for doing his individual work, the question of skill level must be faced. In working toward enhanced human capability, there seems to be no substitute for the workers' skill in the utilization of their tools. That is, assuming the best efforts of equally competent tool-system developers, the system designed to <b>support</b> the more-skilled workers will always provide higher human performance than the one designed to <b>support</b> the less-skilled workers.<br><br>This principle holds true in the domain of computer-augmented <b>collaboration</b> also. The joint effectiveness of the collaborative group will benefit from the skills of all of the participants. And here there is a double level of skills involved: (1) skills of each person in <b>employing</b> computer <b>support</b> for doing individualized work; and (2) skills of each person at <b>employing</b> computer <b>support</b> for <b>collaboration</b>. The higher the group's skills at both levels, the more effective the group will be.<br><br></div><div id='full_3'><mark>Some collaborative <b>provisions</b> may be employed by skilled users to <b>support</b> their <b>collaboration</b> with <b>unskilled</b> users -- and in some cases, skilled users may <b>support</b> <b>collaboration</b> between other, totally <b>unskilled</b> people.</mark></div><div><br><br></div><div id='full_0'><mark>AUGMENT TELEVIEWING<br><br>The remote <b>televiewing</b> provision in AUGMENT is an example of the latter provision, where skilled users can collaborate with lesser-skilled people, and indeed, can <b>support</b> <b>collaboration</b> between those who are totally <b>unskilled</b> in using the system's tools.</mark></div><div><br><br>In this mode of teleconferencing, between two or more people positioned at separated display terminals, the screen image that is being produced for one of them by whatever computer tool(s) he is currently <b>employing</b> can also be simultaneously displayed on each of the other terminals.<br><br>This <b>televiewing</b> state is set up and controlled by executing commands in a special AUGMENT \"Conference\" subsystem. The Conference subsystem permits a user to call an on-line conference of two or more people, view and edit <b>files</b>, add and remove conferees, pass the gavel, and transparently connect to other tool-bearing machines via TYMNET or ARPANET. Televiewing is usually done in conjunction with a telephone connection, and is often used to <b>support</b> <b>document</b> review and revision in a synchronous mode, where all conferees can see and discuss changes as they are made.<br><br>This \"Conference\" subsystem, as with any \"tool\" in the AUGMENT \"workshop,\" will be accessed through the AUGMENT User Interface System (UIS) software module. The UIS modules serving the respective <b>televiewing</b> participants may be running in the same computer, or in different computers that are inter-connected by a network. (The relevant architecture which <b>support</b>s this AUGMENT <b>televiewing</b> capability is outlined in [Ref-3], along with a description of the major functions served by the User Interface System.)<br><br>One function of the UIS module is to <b>support</b> a variety of terminals for AUGMENT use. The UIS transforms the display views constructed by the tools into a form that works for the particular type of terminal equipment employed by each user. Therefore, there may be a variety of display terminals used by the different <b>televiewing</b> participants as they watch the common, \"shared view.\"<br><br>Control of the tool(s) that create and manipulate this shared view can be passed from one participant to another.<br><br>When simultaneously talking on the telephone, the resulting <b>dialog</b> becomes analogous to working around a shared blackboard, upon which individual, group, and public information can be manipulated with chalk and eraser that can be passed around among the participants. Among skilled participants, each is easily able to pull forth and share materials from his private notes or familiar reference sources and copy across into his private workplace any material offered from what the other participants may bring forth. He can demonstrate his own methods, conventions, and special skills, or demonstrate the circumstances where he has trouble and would like advice.<br><br>Typical session goals include coaching, reviewing, mutual problem solving, demonstrating, etc. The more comprehensive and efficient the collective tools and skills are for doing a single individual's kind of work, the more effective these collaborative sessions can be.<br><br>BASIC SUPPORT PROVISIONS: <br>IN-FILE ADDRESSING AND EMBEDDED LINKS<br><br>There are a number of unique characteristics in the structure of AUGMENT <b>files</b>, and in the associated <b>provisions</b> for manipulation and viewing. Generally, their purpose is to increase the facility with which <b>files</b> can be studied and manipulated, and to provide for mixed media (e.g. text, graphics, recorded speech). As mentioned above, increasing each individual collaborator's ability to study and manipulate working information will increase his ability to contribute in an augmented collaborative process.<br><br>The <b>provisions</b> in AUGMENT for flexible and explicit in-file <b>addressing</b> provide collaborative benefit not only through their enhancement of individual's capabilities, but also by direct <b>support</b> of collaborative activities.<br><br>Any given text <b>entity</b> in any AUGMENT file or <b>document</b> -- e.g. chapter, section, paragraph, word or even an individual character -- can be addressed explicitly by a string of characters that every experienced AUGMENT user can construct or read. These address strings may be optionally used in any AUGMENT command that designates an <b>entity</b> to be operated upon or a place in a <b>document</b> to do something about.<br><br>Selecting that <b>entity</b> or place by pointing with a mouse is always an option (and almost always would be employed if that <b>entity</b> or place is visible on the screen). But a user always has the option of using an address string to designate an <b>entity</b> or place that is not being shown. That <b>entity</b> or place may be in in any on-line <b>document</b> to which that user has appropriate access rights (including <b>document</b>s belonging to other users or to a public pool).<br><br>As an aid for specifying useful locations within a <b>document</b>, a user may affix a unique \"name\" of his own choice to any statement. When employed in an address string making it unambiguous which <b>document</b> is being cited, that name will serve to designate its named statement for any AUGMENT operation. Name examples: \"Ref-1\" names the first reference item below; and \"A3\" names the third activity item listed above.<br><br>If an address string is enclosed by parentheses or brackets, the whole is called a \"<b>link</b>.\" Examples: \" [Ref-1]\" is a <b>link</b> pointing to that item in the Reference section below; \"(OAC84-Draft,3B)\" would point to Paragraph 3B in the <b>document</b> file named \"OAC84-Draft.\" Links may be created and edited just as any other text, and may be embedded anywhere in the text of an AUGMENT <b>document</b>. They are understood by a reader to be a <b>citation</b> that \"<b>link</b>s\" this location to some other <b>document</b> <b>entity</b> or place. It is useful to consider the address in a <b>link</b> as specifying a path leading to the cited object.<br><br>A reader who wanted to take a look at the place or <b>entity</b> at the other end of a <b>link</b> could execute a \"Jump (to) Address\" command and type in the corresponding address string -- whereupon AUGMENT would then change the view in a designated display window to be positioned in the designated <b>document</b> at the designated location.<br><br>Alternatively the reader could use a \"Jump (on) Link\" command, and merely: (a) point to the embedded <b>link</b>; then (b) point to the window in which he wanted the cited passage to be displayed. AUGMENT would extract the destination address from the <b>link</b> (instead of expecting the user to type it) and display the referenced passage in the indicated window. </div><div id='full_4'><mark>For instance, when reading the text of this OAC84 <b>document</b> on line, an AUGMENT user could do a Jump Link on one of the reference <b>citation</b>s (which are bonafide <b>link</b>s) and immediately be shown the associated <b>citation</b> statement.</mark></div><div><br><br>A very useful, \"indirect <b>addressing</b>\" provision may be employed in a <b>link</b>'s address string. This amounts to saying, \"when your path reaches Location X, scan along the text there until you find the next <b>link</b>, and then follow that second <b>link</b> to its destination.\" This provision may be employed through an indefinite number of indirect <b>link</b>s. That is, this second <b>link</b> at Location X may in fact contain a similar indirect-address expression -- i.e. \"proceed to Location Y and follow the <b>link</b> you find there\" -- etc.<br><br>Example: \"(Ref-1.l)\". </div><div id='full_2'><mark>To follow this <b>link</b>, the AUGMENT Jump Link command would find the statement in this <b>document</b> that has been named \"Ref-1\" (in the Reference Section below), scan along that statement's text to the first <b>link</b>, \"(AUGMENT,71279,)\", and then follow that <b>link</b>.</mark></div><div> The user would be shown the opening section of <b>document</b> 71279 (from the AUGMENT Journal -- see below -- containing the complete text of the published <b>document</b> cited in [Ref-1]).<br><br>SHARED FILES<br><br>In timesharing environments, users have grown accustomed to being able to share the use of <b>files</b> in the process of <b>collaboration</b>. Users of stand-alone workstations and personal computers generally haven't benefitted from this. The emerging wide-band interconnection options (e.g. local-area networks and public, packet networks) and the integration of file servers into on-line working environments will bring shared-file <b>collaboration</b> into much more prevalence.<br><br>AUGMENT's architecture and general design philosophy assume this kind of working environment. Files containing the hierarchically stored information can be made available to any selected participants, utilizing a number of agreed-upon options for privacy and access. Geographical distances separating collaborators become transparent with remote computer access through networks.<br><br>By <b>employing</b> the above-described, embedded <b>link</b>s, these <b>files</b> may be inter<b>link</b>ed to create a shared network of information. A jointly developed <b>document</b> for instance begins with the entry of the ideas and continues with the elaboration of the idea nodes into a narrative by each member of the collaborating team. In the case of a single product by a team effort (a proposal, report, study, etc.), agreements must be made to control access to specific <b>files</b>.<br><br>The effect on the <b>document</b> as each person adds to, manipulates, and studies the common information is equivalent to passing around a paper draft for comments. But here the drafts are distributed very quickly and there is no retyping phase; the material can constantly reflect the latest modifications for all involved to see and use.<br><br>Expanded, shared spaces require some retrieval <b>support</b>, which can take many forms. For file sharing, the use of an on-line table of contents is generally pertinent. The table of contents for public <b>files</b> (or private subsets) consists of lists of titles and names of <b>files</b>, abstract-like descriptions, with <b>link</b>s to desired nodes in each file. The table of contents (a \"locator\") is hierarchically organized, permitting categorical relationships and viewing that facilitate searching the locator.<br><br>Once any information is located (with one of many searching mechanisms), it is available for direct copying and integrating into any newly developing text. If plagiarism is a concern, there are protective measures to restrict access -- but when <b>collaboration</b> is the intent, the free availability of information to facilitate cooperation and collaborative synergism can be much enhanced.<br><br>AUGMENT automatically maintains an authorship-change record for each statement in each file, indicating the date, time, and author of the statement's creation or last change. This <b>support</b>s coordination among shared-file collaborators -- there are special AUGMENT <b>provisions</b> for viewing these records, and for scanning for statements entered or changed in a given time span or by a given author.<br><br>AUGMENT MAIL<br><br>As a component of our overall development activity, we have made heavy use of our own AUGMENT <b>mail</b> system since 1970, as well as interacting with many non-AUGMENT users through the ARPANET <b>mail</b> systems that have emerged since the early '70s. Today, an AUGMENT user can interact with people on these other <b>mail</b> systems (as served by either ARPANET or TYMNET) in a uniform way, along with his AUGMENT <b>mail</b> interactions, from within his coherent AUGMENT environment.<br><br>After thirteen years of hard-use evolution, the general features and <b>provisions</b> within AUGMENT Mail are probably as complete and sophisticated as any. The system provides speed and flexibility for all message-processing tasks, including composing, <b>addressing</b>, acknowledging, answering, forwarding, studying, and filing them. This allows our users to collaborate with high effectiveness.<br><br>There is a rapidly growing availability to on-line workers of various sorts of inter-personal message handling. The general benefit to collaborative work seems well recognized. Some of the features of AUGMENT add unique benefits beyond what seems generally experienced, and are worth mentioning here.<br><br>One unique source of benefit for AUGMENT Mail collaborators is that the content of a <b>mail</b> item is actually an AUGMENT <b>document</b> -- perhaps only a one-sentence <b>document</b>, but optionally a full-sized one. As such it carries structure, may include embedded graphics, may be directly copied into a recipient's <b>document</b>, etc.<br><br>And another unique benefit is derived from use of AUGMENT <b>link</b>s. For instance, a simple, one-sentence message might be, \"Frank: Your comment in (Market-Bin, New-Plan, 4b3) seems to conflict directly with the boss's directive in (Division-Records, Dev-Policy, 7c).\" When Frank gets the message, he can hold this passage in one display window, and via Jump Link commands, put each of the cited passages into other windows for immediate study.<br><br>AUGMENT JOURNAL<br><br>Ongoing <b>collaboration</b> will benefit from <b>provisions</b> in addition to those for sharing <b>files</b> and handling <b>mail</b>. Dialogue implies a longitudinal series of transactions that are interrelated in various ways. For full <b>support</b> of task-oriented <b>dialog</b>ue, a history of the <b>dialog</b>ue is often valuable, and must be easily accessible through retrieval mechanisms.<br><br>The history should provide a chronicle of <b>dialog</b> \"transactions,\" i.e. a Journal. Within the AUGMENT system, there is provision for installing, maintaining and utilizing what we call Journal systems. A Journal system <b>support</b>s a recorded form of <b>dialog</b> having attributes similar to those provided to professional circles by the combination of their professional <b>journals</b> and the libraries that store, catalog and provide access to them..<br><br>Having created an on-line record of thoughts and ideas, the author (or a clerk) may direct the system to distribute it to a larger group. Such a contribution may range in size from a one-sentence message to a two-hundred-page <b>document</b>.<br><br>In submitting this contribution a <b>document</b> to an AUGMENT Journal, the author specifies a title, and may include comments (analogous to a preface or other notes attached to a report). A distribution list may be specified -- using the same personal and group identifiers as for AUGMENT Mail. Other fields will be added automatically upon <b>submission</b>, such as date and time. Less frequently used fields provide the computer with a basis for fairly complete bibliographical handling of this <b>dialog</b>ue item. The author is given on-line computer guidance for easily filling out the necessary fields.<br><br>Upon <b>submission</b> to a specified Journal, the item is automatically given a number and is stored permanently in a central location. A full bibliographical <b>citation</b> will be generated and installed in library-like, computer-held catalogs. For each individual in the distribution list, a short <b>citation</b> will be delivered into his AUGMENT Mail box. One of the elements in this <b>citation</b> is a <b>link</b> pointing to the centrally stored Journal <b>document</b>. Using this <b>link</b>, a recipient may employ a simple Jump Link command to gain immediate access to the Journal <b>document</b>, and can study it or copy all or parts of it into working <b>files</b>.<br><br></div><div id='full_1'><mark>For example, References Ref-1, Ref-2 and Ref-3 were stored in the \"AUGMENT\" journal, as their Journal-reference <b>link</b>s indicate, and an AUGMENT user with Journal-system access may still retrieve those <b>document</b>s from the system.</mark></div><div> There are of the order of 100,000 entries in that \"AUGMENT\" Journal collection -- going back to August 1970.<br><br>This current <b>document</b> was entered as Item # 2221 into the more-recently established, \"OAD\" Journal collection. I exercised a Journal-system option and obtained a pre-assigned number so that I could include the number in the text of the <b>document</b> before final <b>submission</b>. Henceforth, another AUGMENT <b>document</b> may use the <b>citation</b> <b>link</b> \"(OAD,2221,A2)\" to cite the second \"activity item\" listed above in this <b>document</b>. A completely unambiguous <b>citation</b>, good for the indefinite future.<br><br>General access to the data base of Journal <b>document</b>s is through an on-line catalog. Searches through the cataloged <b>citation</b>s can retrieve <b>citation</b>s by author, accession number, title word, or key-word descriptor.<br><br>Subcollections for special groups or activity themes may be optionally maintained. Descriptors assigned at the time a <b>document</b> is submitted can classify it as belonging to a given \"conference\"; but such initial classifications needn't be restrictive, since at any later time a <b>document</b> may be published (in the Journal) which lists a set of <b>document</b>s and/or of passages, from among the entire prior collection of Journal items, which are deemed to be relevant to a given theme.<br><br>Or, a dynamic collection may be maintained by an interested party, in shared <b>files</b>, as a list of <b>citation</b>s with <b>link</b>s pointing directly to the items (<b>document</b>s or passages) in the Journal.<br><br>No one is able to modify the centrally held Journal <b>document</b> -- these <b>document</b>s are considered to be just as permanent a record as one that has been published and put into a library. If Journal <b>document</b>s are not accessed for a given period of time, they are removed from on-line storage and archived on tape. Later, if given the Journal accession number, AUGMENT operations will retrieve the item from archive tapes, just as a library would retrieve from its stacks if a little-used <b>document</b> had been removed from the open shelves.<br><br>The central storage of <b>dialog</b>ue entries represents the recorded <b>dialog</b>ue, including replies and cross-reference <b>link</b>s -- essentially a network of interrelated <b>submission</b>s.<br><br>The Journal systems provide central storage for the same reasons that libraries do: it is too costly for each individual to maintain his or her own collection; and there is need for assurance that a specified <b>document</b> may be provided in unaltered form.<br><br>These Journal <b>provisions</b> encourage freer use by authors of commentary on prior entries, since an author knows that every reader has a simple means for accessing any of the earlier <b>document</b>s that may be cited.<br><br>A new participant, entering into an established <b>dialog</b> process, may simply be given a relevant set of <b>citation</b>s to be brought completely into the picture.<br><br>Often, a passage in an earlier Journal <b>document</b> which was originally submitted as relevant only to a given theme or issue, will later be discovered by someone to be relevant to another, current issue. In this case, a new <b>document</b> may be entered into this newer \"<b>dialog</b> network\" that points out this relevance and provides a <b>citation</b> <b>link</b> to this old <b>document</b>, which now has become <b>link</b>ed into the new <b>dialog</b>.<br><br><br>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS<br><br>The principles underlying this work and the basic implementation of system architecture and features were done at SRI International, sponsored by the Air Force, NASA and DARPA, and contributed to by many bright colleagues in the Augmentation Research Center. Solid enhancements have been made to the Conference Sub-system, the Mail System, and the Journal System since AUGMENT was moved to Tymshare in 1978, with many good ideas contributed out of the experience of essentially the entire Office Automation Division.<br></div>",

Engelbart <br>Tymshare, Inc.<br><br>From COMPCON '84 Digest: Proceedings of the COMPCON Conference, San Francisco, CA, February 27 - March 1, 1984 (OAD,2250,).<br><br>ABSTRACT<br><br>AUGMENT is a <b>text</b> processing system marketed by Tymshare for a multi-user, network environment. In AUGMENT's frontend is a User Interface System that facilitates flexible evolution of <b>command</b> languages and provides optional <b>command</b> recognition features. Exceptionally fast and flexible control of interactive operations is enabled by concurrent action of mouse and optional one-handed chord keyset. Files are hierarchically structured, and <b>text</b>ual <b>address</b> expressions can flexibly specify any <b>text</b> entity in any <b>file</b>. The screen may be divided into arbitrary, rectangular <b>windows</b>, allowing cross-<b>file</b> editing between <b>windows</b>. Many options exist for controlling the \"view\" of a <b>file</b>'s <b>text</b> in a window, e.g.: level clipping, paragraph truncation, and content filtering. Structural study and modification of on-line documents are especially facilitated. A Journal system and \"Shared Screen Teleconferencing\" support collaboration among <b>authors</b> and their colleagues. Graphic illustrations may be embedded in the same <b>file</b> with <b>text</b>.<br><br>INTRODUCTION<br><br>AUGMENT was designed for augmenting human intellectual capabilities. It was targeted particularly toward the core work of professionals engaged in \"tough knowledge work\" -- e.g., planning, analyzing, and designing in complex problem domains. And special attention was paid to augmenting group collaboration among <b>workers</b> pursuing common goals.<br><br>Authorship has received a great deal of attention in AUGMENT's evolution, as one of the central human activities to be augmented. An important set of provisions within AUGMENT -- in its architecture, design principles, and specific features -- is directly aimed toward bringing high performance to the <b>authors</b>hip activities of knowledge <b>workers</b>. For the purposes of this paper, we thus speak interchangeably of \"knowledge worker\" and \"author.\"<br><br>We recognize explicitly that highly skilled <b>workers</b> in any field, and knowledge work is no exception, are those with good <b>command</b> of their tools. Our basic design goal was to provide a set of tools that would not themselves limit the capabilities of the people using them. A system designed to encourage more skilled <b>workers</b> will always enable higher human performance than one designed to support less skilled <b>workers</b>.<br><br>In this regard, our design goal was to provide as much capability as possible for each level of system usage skill, and a continuous evolution path between skill levels. We believe firmly that knowledge <b>workers</b> are motivated to grow in knowledge and skill and that provisions in system design should support this. As the rest of the paper reveals, this approach translates into a rich set of AUGMENT provisions, aimed at providing speed and flexibility for skilled <b>workers</b> in organizing and pursuing their core knowledge work -- in which \"<b>authors</b>hip\" is a primary activity.<br><br>An explicit sub-goal in AUGMENT's development was to \"augment\" the development, production and control of complex technical documentation -- through the whole cycle of gathering information, planning, creating, collaborating, reviewing, editing, controlling versions, designing layout, and producing the final documents.<br><br>This paper concentrates upon the development phase of this cycle. AUGMENT has well-developed tools to support the later, production phase, but their discussion is not included here.<br><br>Studying another's work provides a well-recognized challenge, but one of the toughest jobs is to study one's own work during its development: to see what it really says about Issue X; to see if it does provide for Concept Y; to see if it is reasonably organized and structured -- and to do these over a body of material before it is \"polished\", i.e., before it is well structured, coherently worded, non-redundant and consistently termed.<br><br><br>SOME BACKGROUND<br><br>History<br><br>AUGMENT is an integrated system of knowledge-worker tools that is marketed by Tymshare's Office Automation Division. The system was developed at SRI International over an extended period under the sponsorship of NASA, DARPA, and RADC. Commercial rights were transferred to Tymshare in 1978 (where the system has since been renamed from NLS to AUGMENT) and its evolution continued. A short history of AUGMENT's development may be found in <Ref-1>, along with a summary of system characteristics and features. The general R&D philosophy and the design principles behind AUGMENT'S development are laid out in <Ref-2>.<br><br>The system evolved on time-shared, mainframe computers, and in a packet-switched network environment. In 1970 our computer was the second to be attached to the ARPANET, and since 1978 we have also operated extensively in the TYMNET environment. We have benefited directly from both the time-sharing and the network environments in matters that are important to the <b>authors</b>hip process -- especially in dealing with large documents and multi-party documentation activities. In 1976-77 we conducted some applied studies for the Air Force, as reported in <Ref-3> and <Ref-4>, which concentrated upon this latter application.<br><br>Relevant Architectural Features<br><br>Perhaps AUGMENT's most unique architectural feature is its User Interface System (UIS), a special software module, which handles the human/computer interfaces to all interactive programs. It takes care of all <b>command</b>-language dialog and connection protocols, and provides a framework for building a coherent and integrated user environment while supporting flexible evolution on both sides: on the user's side, with evolution of <b>command</b> function and terminology; and on the technology side, with evolving hardware and software. (Design details are outlined in <Ref-5>; rationale and utilization in <Ref-6>.)<br><br>The UIS provides a reach-through service to non-AUGMENT systems, and can optionally translate back and forth to a foreign program's <b>command</b> language. It also supports the shared-screen, remote collaboration capability discussed below.<br><br>AUGMENT's architecture provides for open-ended expansion and flexible evolution of system functionality and worker <b>command</b> languages.<br><br>It is assumed that for any class of knowledge <b>workers</b>, specialized application systems developed by other parties, perhaps running on other computers, will provide services worth integrating. The \"author class\" of worker should be no exception. Continuing evolution toward the \"author workshop of the future\" will certainly depend upon some such features in workshop architecture.<br><br>It provides adaptation for different terminal characteristics, enabling application programers to work as though with a virtual terminal.<br><br>File Characteristics<br><br>AUGMENT employs explicitly structured <b>file</b>s, with hierarchically organized nodes; each node can contain either or all of: up to 2,000 characters of <b>text</b>, a graphic structure, or other forms of useful data (e.g., digitized speech). The worker has a definite model in mind for the structuring of any <b>file</b> that he works with; in composing and modifying it he can organize and modify structure using the same verbs as for working with <b>text</b> strings (e.g. Insert, Replace, Move, Copy, Delete), with appropriate structural-entity nouns (e.g., Statement, Branch, Group, Plex). For any existing hierarchical structure, he has many flexible alternatives for <b>address</b>ing its entities, modifying its organization, jumping around within it, and viewing it in a most beneficial manner.<br><br>(Note: AUGMENT <b>workers</b> generally use the term \"<b>statement</b>\" to refer to a <b>file</b> node, which is natural enough since the terminology became established before we added the graphic capability. Now an AUGMENT \"<b>statement</b>\" can contain either or both a <b>text</b> <b>statement</b> and a graphic diagram.)<br><br><br>CONTROLLING THE TOOLS<br><br>Many of AUGMENT's unique author-support provisions <b>address</b> basic operations common to almost every task, things done over and over again. These operations, executed with speed and flexibility, provide for composing and modifying one's working material, and for studying what is there over a wide range of substantive levels -- from a single <b>text</b> passage to a collection of end-product draft documents and their associated set of working notes, reference material, and recorded-message dialog (assuming all to be on line).<br><br>In the early stages of our program at SRI, we did a great deal of detailed work on what we called the \"control interface\" -- how users control the functional application of their tools. These details can be very important to \"low-level\" interactions which are done hundreds of times during a working day. Some of these details are quite relevant to bringing high performance to the <b>authors</b>hip process.<br><br>AUGMENT <b>command</b>s are expressed with verbs, nouns, and appropriate qualifier words; every <b>command</b> word is designated by entering one or more characters. The UIS recognizes the <b>command</b> word from these characters according to the <b>command</b>-recognition options designated in each individual's \"pro<b>file</b> <b>file</b>.\" Users seem to migrate fairly rapidly to \"expert\" recognition modes, where a minimum number of characters will elicit recognition of <b>command</b> words. The fully spelled-out <b>command</b> words are presented in the Command Feedback Window as soon as they are recognized. The Backspace Key will cause backup, one <b>command</b> word at a time.<br><br>Of the system requirements behind our choice of this noun-verb <b>command</b> form, two are particularly relevant here: (1) The \"vocabulary\" of the functions of the tools, and of the entities they operate upon, must be as extensible as is a natural language; (2) Textual lists of <b>command</b>s must conveniently lend themselves to writing, documenting, and executing as \"macro\" <b>command</b>s.<br><br>Screen selection is done with a mouse. If the <b>command</b>'s noun is a single, defined <b>text</b> or structure entity, e.g., a \"word\", then there is only one selection needed (e.g., to pick any character in the designated word).<br><br>Besides using a standard keyboard for character entry, an AUGMENT user may optionally use a five-key, one-hand, chord keyset. Remarkably little practice is required in order to enter alphabetic characters, one hand-stroke per character. With less than five hours practice, a person can begin profitably working in a two-handed, concurrent mode -- operating the mouse with one hand and simultaneously entering <b>command</b> characters and short literal strings with the other hand.<br><br>Here is an example of a low-level action which reveals some basic characteristics of high-performance execution. It is a very simple situation, but representative of what is met over and over and over again in doing hard knowledge work. The worker is composing or modifying something in one area of the screen, when his eye catches a one-character typo in another area. For a skilled AUGMENT worker, the typo could be corrected in less time than it would take someone to point it out to him -- with three quick strokes of the keyset hand during a casual flick of the mouse hand, and an absolute minimum of visual and mental attention taken from the other ongoing task.<br><br>Fast, flexible, graceful, low effort -- these are important to all high-frequency, low-level, knowledge-work actions. This same kind of speed and flexibility are achieved by skilled AUGMENT <b>workers</b> in executing all of the other functional features described below. Description of mouse and keyset, and their concurrent employment, may be found in <Ref-7>.<br><br><br>ADDRESSING THE WORKING MATERIALS<br><br>There is a consistent set of <b>address</b>ing features that a worker may use in any <b>command</b> to designate a particular structural node or some element of <b>text</b> or graphics attached to that node. It adds appreciably to the power and flexibility of the system <b>command</b>s to have a rich, universally applicable vocabulary for directly <b>address</b>ing particular entities within the working <b>file</b>s. Below are some examples.<br><br>Explicit Statement Addresses<br><br>There are four \"handles\" by which a given <b>statement</b> may be directly <b>address</b>ed:<br><br>Structural Statement Number. This designates the current \"structural location\" of the <b>statement</b>. It is assigned by the system, depending upon where the worker installs or moves a <b>statement</b> within an existing structure, or how that structure might have been re-organized subsequently. It is usually expressed as an alternating sequence of number-letter fields -- e.g. \"1\", \"1a\", \"1a1\", \"1a2\", and \"1b\". At a worker's option, these same <b>statement</b> numbers could be shown as \"1\", \"1.1\", \"1.1.1\", \"1.1.2\", or \"1.2\", but this bulkier alternative is seldom chosen.<br><br>Statement Identifier (or SID). This is a unique integer, assigned in sequential order by the system as each <b>statement</b> is first inserted, and which stays with a <b>statement</b> no matter how much its content may be altered or where it may be moved in its <b>file</b> structure. To make it uniquely recognizable for what it is, a SID is always displayed, printed, or designated with a prefixed \"0\" -- e.g., \"012\", \"0417\", etc. SIDs are particularly useful for referencing passages in a document while it is evolving.<br><br>Worker-Assigned Statement Name (or label). For any <b>statement</b> or part of the <b>file</b> structure, an author can designate as \"name delimiters\" a pair of characters that indicate to the system when the first word of a <b>statement</b> is to be treated as a name for that <b>statement</b>. For instance, if \"(\" and \")\" are set by the author as name delimiters for a specified part of the <b>file</b>, any parenthesized first word in a <b>statement</b> would be recognized by the system as that <b>statement</b>'s name.<br><br>(Note: It is optional whether to have any of the above three identifiers displayed or printed with the <b>statement</b>s' <b>text</b>.)<br><br>A Direct Screen Selection. When a <b>statement</b> to be designated is displayed in a window, usually the best way to \"<b>address</b>\" it is to use the mouse to position the cursor anywhere on the <b>statement</b> and depress the mouse's \"Select\" key (indicated below by \"<Select>\"). This mode is generally used for <b>text</b> manipulation -- selecting characters, words, numbers, visibles, invisibles, etc. (any of the <b>text</b> entities which have been made system recognizable).<br><br>Markers<br><br>As one \"holds a place\" in a book by leaving a temporary place <b>marker</b> in it, an author can place \"<b>marker</b>s\" at arbitrary locations within an AUGMENT <b>file</b>. When placing a <b>marker</b>, he attaches it to a specific character in the <b>text</b> and gives it a name or label. Marker names are local to each <b>file</b>. Simple <b>command</b>s provide for displaying where one's <b>marker</b>s are located and what their names are, for deleting or moving a <b>marker</b>, or for installing a new one.<br><br>A <b>marker</b> name may be included in an <b>address</b> expression, to provide another way of designating an <b>address</b>. A <b>marker</b> name can designate not only a particular <b>statement</b>, but a specific character within that <b>statement</b>. For example, \"Copy Word #x (to follow word) <Select>\" would designate that a word located somewhere in the <b>file</b> and marked with an \"x\" is to be copied to follow the cursor-selected word. There are many unique ways in which <b>marker</b>s may be employed by an author who has integrated their artful use into her working methodology.<br><br></div><div id='full_4'><mark>As a comparative example of some of the foregoing <b>address</b>ing forms, consider a <b>statement</b> whose SID is \"069\", whose <b>statement</b> number is \"3b5\", that has <b>statement</b>-name delimiters designated for it as \"NULL\" and \":\", that starts with the <b>text</b> \"Capacity: For every ...\", and that has a <b>marker</b> named \"x\" positioned on one of its characters.</mark></div><div> </div><div id='full_0'><mark>A <b>command</b> to move this <b>statement</b> could optionally be expressed as:<br><br>\"Move Statement <Select> ...\",<br><br>\"Move Statement 3b5 ...\",<br><br>\"Move Statement 069 ...\",<br><br>\"Move Statement Capacity ...\", or<br><br>\"Move Statement #x ...\".</mark></div><div><br><br>Relative-Address Extensions<br><br>A sequence of characters may be appended to the <b>address</b> of a given <b>statement</b> to specify an <b>address</b> of a position \"relative\" to that <b>statement</b>. A major class of these designations deals with relative structural location, such as: Up a level, Down a level, Successor at same level, Predecessor at same level, Head at this level, Tail at this level, and End <b>statement</b> at last and lowest position in this branch. A period (\".\") in the <b>address</b> string indicates that relative <b>address</b>ing is beginning, and each of these relative-location designators is indicated with a directly mnemonic, one-letter designation.<br><br></div><div id='full_1'><mark>For example, \"Move Statement 0609 (to follow <b>statement</b>) 4b.dt\" would move Statement 0609 to follow the tail <b>statement</b> of the substructure one level down from Statement 4b -- or, to conceptualize the associated <b>address</b>-location pathway, \"go to 4b, then Down a level and to the Tail\".</mark></div><div><br><br>Embedded Citation Links<br><br>A special use of <b>address</b> expressions is within an explicit <b>text</b> entity that we call a \"Citation Link\" (or \"Link\" for short). Links are used as <b>text</b>ual citations to some specific <b>file</b> item within the workshop domain. A <b>link</b> is delimited by parentheses or angle brackets and contains a valid <b>address</b> string whose path leads to the cited <b>file</b> entity. For example, \"(0306)\" or \"(4b.dt)\" are valid <b>link</b>s. Also, the reference items at the end of this paper are <b>statement</b>s named \"Ref-1\", \"Ref-2\", etc., and as such can be cited with <b>link</b>s \"<Ref-1>\", \"<Ref-2>\", etc. An AUGMENT reader may travel via such a <b>link</b> directly to the referenced bibliographic citation.<br><br>A special feature in AUGMENT's <b>link</b> provisions is the use of \"indirect <b>link</b> referencing\". In path-following terms, including \".l\" in an <b>address</b> string stipulates, \"scan forward from this point to the next <b>link</b>, and follow that <b>link</b> to its target.\" For example, to follow the path prescribed by <b>link</b> \"(4b.l)\", one would \"go to 4b, then find the first <b>link</b> in that <b>statement</b> and follow the path that it specifies.\" This latter path in turn could prescribe use of another <b>link</b>, etc. There is no intrinsic limit to the number of these indirect <b>link</b>s that may be employed in a given path -- only a natural caution against such a path looping back upon itself.<br><br>As an example, note that \"<Ref-1>\" is a <b>link</b> to the <b>statement</b> named \"Ref-1\", a bibliographic citation at the end of this paper. In that citation, there is a <b>link</b> to the original source document of the referenced publication, permanently stored in the AUGMENT Journal as Item 71279 (the Journal is described below). The point to be made here is that with the <b>link</b> \"<Ref-1.l>\", I can reference the original source document -- and a Jump Link <b>command</b> would \"take me there.\"<br><br>Text and Content Addressing<br><br>Other <b>address</b>ing options include scanning for a content match, and/or stepping backward and forward a given number of characters or words (or other <b>text</b> entities). For instance, the foregoing <b>link</b> could have involved a bit more smarts in designating which <b>link</b> to follow: e.g., the path for '(4b \"*D\" .l)' would be \"to 4b, scan for first occurrence of \"*D\", then follow the next <b>link</b> found in that <b>statement</b>.\"<br><br>Other-File Addressing<br><br>By preceding an in-<b>file</b> <b>address</b> string with a <b>file</b> <b>address</b>, and separating the two strings with a comma, one obtains a composite <b>address</b> designating a given entity within a given <b>file</b>. Extending this principle lets one prefix the <b>file</b> name with a directory name in which the <b>file</b> is to be found; and further, one can prefix this with a <b>host</b>-computer name.<br><br>For example, '(Office-5, Program-Documentation, Sequence-Doc, Specifications \"Journal\")' specifies the path: to the Office-5 <b>host</b> computer, to its Program-Documentation <b>file</b> directory, to its Sequence-Doc <b>file</b>, to its <b>statement</b> named \"Specifications\", and then scan to the location of the <b>text</b> \"Journal\".<br><br>If a person were working on the Office-5 <b>host</b>, he would only have to specify '(Program-Documentation, Sequence-Doc, Specifications \"Journal\")'. If he were already working within a <b>file</b> with its \"<b>link</b> default\" set to the Program-Documentation directory, he would only have to specify '(Sequence-Doc, Specifications \"Journal\")'. And if he were already working within the Sequence-Doc <b>file</b>, he would only have to specify '(Specifications \"Journal\")'. And if he were planning to reference items relative to the Statement named \"Specifications\" very often, he could affix a <b>marker</b> (e.g., named \"s\") to its front and would then only have to specify '(#s \"Journal\")'.<br><br>Or, suppose he were working in another <b>file</b> in a different directory on Office-5 and wanted to reference items relative to that same \"far off\" <b>statement</b> with special ease: in some temporary place in that <b>file</b> he could install a <b>statement</b> named \"Ref\" (for example) containing the <b>text</b>ual <b>link</b>, \"(Program-Documentation, Sequence-Doc, Specifications)\". He could then cite the above reference with the <b>link</b>, '(Ref.l \"Journal\")'. </div><div id='full_2'><mark>This path description is: go to the <b>statement</b> in this <b>file</b> named \"Ref\", take the first <b>link</b> that you find there (traveling across intervening directories and <b>file</b>s and <b>statement</b>s), and beginning in the <b>statement</b> on the other end of that <b>link</b>, scan forward to the string \"Journal\".</mark></div><div><br><br>This is only a cursory treatment, but should illustrate well enough what is meant by \"a rich and flexible <b>address</b>ing vocabulary.\" As with other high-performance features in AUGMENT, a beginner is not forced to become involved in the larger vocabulary in order to do useful work (with productivity on at least a par with some other, restricted-vocabulary system). But an AUGMENT worker interested in higher performance can steadily pick up more of the optional vocabulary and skills in a smooth, upward-compatible progression.<br><br><br>CONTROLLING THE VIEWS<br><br>A user of a book, or of most on-line <b>text</b> systems, is constrained to viewing the <b>text</b> as though he had a window through which he sees a fixed, formatted document. But as described below, our worker can view a section of <b>text</b> in many ways, depending upon his need of the moment.<br><br>Multiple Windows<br><br>For whatever total screen area is available to the worker, his general performance will be improved significantly if he can flexibly allocate that area into arbitrary-sized <b>windows</b> whose contents can be independently controlled. AUGMENT has long provided this basic capability, along with the provision that material from any accessible <b>file</b> may be shown in any window, and also that screen-select copying or moving can be done across the different <b>windows</b>.<br><br>(Note: Cross-<b>file</b> editing can be done at any time, between any two legally accessible <b>file</b>s. If one or the other <b>file</b>'s material or destination is not being displayed in any of the <b>windows</b>, one may always opt to employ a <b>text</b>ual <b>address</b> expression instead of a <Select> within any editing <b>command</b>.)<br><br>User-adjustable parameters are used to control the view presented on the display. Adjusting one's view parameters is a constantly used AUGMENT feature that has solidly proved its value. To facilitate their quick and flexible use, the view-specification actions evolved into cryptic, single-character codes, called \"<b>viewspecs</b>.\" The syntax of all Jump <b>command</b>s (used for traveling) includes the option of designating new <b>viewspecs</b>, and a special combination of mouse buttons enables quick, concurrent, keyset action to change the <b>viewspecs</b> for a given window. Here are a few of the frequently used view controls:<br><br>Window Views<br><br>Structure Cutoff. </div><div id='full_3'><mark>Show only the <b>statement</b>s that lie \"below\" this <b>statement</b> in the structure (i.e., this \"branch\"); or show only those following <b>statement</b>s that are at this level or deeper; or show all of the following <b>statement</b>s that will fit in this window.</mark></div><div><br><br>Level Clipping. For the designated structure cutoff, show only the <b>statement</b>s down to a specified level. Lower-level <b>statement</b>s are \"clipped\" from the view; the worker can thus view just a selected number of the upper levels of his document/<b>file</b>.<br><br>Statement Truncation. For those <b>statement</b>s brought into view (as selected by other view specifications), show only their first n lines. Truncation to one line is often used, along with level clipping, in order to get an effective overview.<br><br>Inter-Statement Separation. For viewing ease -- blank lines can be optionally installed between <b>statement</b>s.<br><br>(Note: The foregoing view controls are extremely helpful when studying and modifying a document's structural organization.)<br><br>Statement Numbers and Names. Optionally, for a given window, show the Statement Number (or the SID) of each <b>statement</b> -- with an option for showing them at either the right or at the left margin. Independently, the showing of <b>statement</b> names may be turned on or off.<br><br>Frozen Statements. A worker may select a number of <b>statement</b>s, in random order, and designate them as \"frozen.\" One of the view-specification options is to have the frozen <b>statement</b>s appear at the top of the frame, with the rest of that window left for normal viewing and editing. The frozen <b>statement</b>s may be edited, or even cross-edited between any other displayed (or <b>address</b>able) <b>statement</b>s.<br><br>User-Specified Content Filters. A simple content-analysis language may be used in a \"Set Content Pattern\" <b>command</b>, which compiles a little content-checking program. One of the view-specification options will cause the system to display only those <b>statement</b>s which satisfy both the structure and level conditions imposed by other <b>viewspecs</b>, and which also pass the content-analysis test applied by this program. Where desired, very sophisticated content-analysis programs may be written, using a full-blown programming language, and placed on call for any user.<br><br>User-Specified Sequence Generators<br><br>In the foregoing, a \"view\" is created by beginning at a designated location in a document (<b>file</b>) and selecting certain of the the \"following\" <b>statement</b>s for display, according to the viewing parameters -- possibly suppressing <b>statement</b>s that don't pass the test of a content-analysis program. This is essentially a \"parameterized sequence generator,\" and provides very useful options for selectively viewing <b>statement</b>s within a document; however, it works only by selectively discarding <b>statement</b>s from a sequence provided in standard order.<br><br>Application programmers can provide alternate sequence-generator programs, which any user can invoke in a straightforward manner. In such a case, the apparent structure being presented to the user could be generated from a sequence of candidate <b>statement</b>s according to any rules one may invent -- and the actual views could be further controlled by the above-described <b>viewspecs</b> for level clipping, truncation, content filtering, etc.<br><br>Perhaps the most commonly used, special sequence generator is one that provides an \"Include\" feature, where specially tagged <b>link</b>s embedded in the <b>text</b> will cause their cited passages to be \"included\" in place of the Include-Link <b>statement</b>s, as though they were part of this <b>file</b>. This provision enables arbitrary assemblage of <b>text</b> and formatting directives, from a wide collection of <b>file</b>s, to represent a virtual, one-document, super <b>file</b>. For instance, the whole assemblage could be passed to the formatter, by means of a single user action, to generate a composite, photo-typeset document.<br><br><br>TRAVELING THROUGH THE WORKING FILES<br><br>An important provision in AUGMENT enables an author to freely \"travel around\" in his on-line <b>file</b> space to reach a particular \"view point\" of his choice -- i.e., the position within a <b>file</b> from which the system develops the desired form of \"view\" according to the currently invoked view specifications.<br><br>Traveling from one view point to another is accomplished by Jump <b>command</b>s, of which the simplest perhaps is a direct Jump to a <b>statement</b> designated by a screen selection. Then, for a worker grown used to employing <b>address</b> strings, a next form would be a Jump on an embedded <b>link</b>, or to a <b>statement</b> designated by a typed-in <b>address</b> string -- using any combination of the <b>address</b>ing elements and <b>viewspecs</b> described above. For example, the <b>link</b> \"<4b:mi>\" points to the Statement 4b, while invoking <b>viewspecs</b> \"m\" and \"I\" which cause the <b>statement</b>s' SIDs to be displayed. The <b>link</b> \"<Ref-1.l:i;LL>\" points to the document referenced by the <b>link</b> in the <b>statement</b> named \"Ref-1\", invoking viewspec \"i\" for user content filtering, and sets the filter to \"LL\" to show only those <b>statement</b>s beginning with a lower-case letter. The applications are effectively endless.<br><br>MODIFYING THE DOCUMENT STRUCTURES<br><br>Given the array of capabilities described above, it is very simple also to provide for very flexible manipulation of the <b>file</b> structure. For operating on a small, basic set of structure-entity nouns, essentially the same basic verbs may be used as for <b>text</b> manipulation -- i.e. Insert, Delete, Move, Copy, Replace, and Transpose are quite sufficient for most cases. For instance, \"Move Branch 2b (to follow) 3c\" immediately moves Statement 2b and all of its sub<b>statement</b>s to follow Statement 3c -- and their <b>statement</b> numbers are automatically changed from 2b, 2b1, etc., to 3d, 3d1, etc.<br><br>A few extra verbs are useful for structure manipulation. For instance, a \"Break\" <b>command</b> will break a given <b>statement</b> off at a designated point in its <b>text</b> string, and establish the rest of the <b>text</b> as a new, separate <b>statement</b>. And an \"Append\" <b>command</b> does the reverse -- i.e., it appends the <b>text</b> of one or more existing <b>statement</b>s to the end of a designated <b>statement</b>.<br><br>A major source of structure-modification capability derives from the associated \"studying\" capabilities. For example, if an author can view a <b>file</b> (document) with specifications that show him only one line each of just those <b>statement</b>s in the top two levels, he gets an overview of the high-level organization that helps immensely to study his current structure or outline.<br><br>Concurrent use of mouse and keyset also provide considerable gains in speed and flexibility for studying and modifying document structure. For example, if when studying the overview described in the previous paragraph, the author perceives that Statement 2b really belongs in Section 3, following Statement 3c, he can execute the necessary move <b>command</b> in a very quick, deft manner:<br><br>Keyset hand strikes \"m\" and \"b\" (for Move Branch), while the mouse hand is positioning the cursor anywhere in the <b>text</b> line of Statement 2b. [Two chord strokes.]<br><br>The mouse hand depresses the <Select> button on the mouse while the cursor is on Statement 2b, then moves to Statement 3c and depresses it again, and then depresses it again to say, \"OK, do it.\" [Three button pushes, synchronized with the mouse movement as it made two selections on easy, window-wide, whole-line targets.]<br><br>(Note: I just had myself timed for this above operation -- an unhurried 2.5 seconds.)<br><br>In our view, interactive computer support offers an author a priceless opportunity to get away from the geometric bondage inflicted by pages, margins, and lines -- things which have very little if any bearing upon the content and organization of one's <b>text</b>. In terms of value to the authoring process, we differ sharply from those who advocate a \"What you see is what you get\" working mode during the development of a document's content and organization. For this kind of work, experienced users of the foregoing kind of flexible facility for <b>address</b>ing, viewing, and manipulating structured documents, would consider a \"What you see ...\" mode as a relative handicap.<br><br><br>SUPPORTING MULTI-PARTY COLLABORATION<br><br>The support that advanced technology can provide for close collaboration among knowledge <b>workers</b> is a very important and much under-rated possibility. For multiple-author activities, collaborative support is an important aspect of system capability. Some years ago, we introduced the following provisions into AUGMENT. (A more complete, overview treatment of these is given in <Ref-8>.)<br><br>Electronic Mail. Its primary attributes of speed, automatic distribution, and computer-to-computer directness are well recognized -- and are generally accepted now as important to the effectiveness of knowledge <b>workers</b>. AUGMENT Mail has features that are beyond what most electronic mail systems offer, and which provide unique benefit to the <b>authors</b>hip process.<br><br>AUGMENT's mail system allows one to \"send\" complete, structured documents as well as small messages. In an <b>authors</b>hip environment, an important role for \"electronic mail\" is for the control and distribution of documents -- where small, throw-away messages are considered to be but a special class of document. An author should be able to bundle up any combination of <b>text</b> and graphics, in the forms that he has been using for studying and manipulating them -- and send the bundle to other <b>workers</b>. In AUGMENT, such a bundle is just like any other <b>file</b> structure, and can be studied and manipulated, incorporated into other <b>file</b>s (documents), saved or deleted.<br><br>Recorded Mail -- AUGMENT's Journal System. When mailing a document, an AUGMENT worker may optionally specify that it be installed as a \"recorded\" item. In this case, before distributing the item, the system will make a permanent record if it, as a <b>file</b> in a specified Journal collection. And, just as though it had been published, this recorded Journal item cannot later be changed. The system assigns a straightforward accession identifier (a simple number), and any authorized worker is henceforth guaranteed access to that Journal item by specifying the name of the Journal-collection and the Journal-item number -- e.g., as specified in the <b>link</b> \"<OAD,2237,>\".<br><br>A given <b>journal</b> may be set up to serve multiple <b>host</b>s and is much like a special library. It has its collection of documents, and AUGMENT provides associated support processes for entry, cataloging, retrieval, and access.<br><br>Together with the <b>link</b>ing capability described above, a Journal system provides an extremely effective form of \"recorded dialog.\" Cross-reference <b>link</b>s between a succession of Journal items produces an inter-<b>link</b>ed network of collaborative contributions -- plans, outlines, document drafts, schedules, short comments, detailed critiques, reference material, etc. The on-line worker can follow these <b>link</b>s very easily and, using multiple <b>windows</b> and flexible viewing options, can make very effective use of such records.<br><br>For instance, consider a detailed <b>commentary</b> directed toward a \"preliminary design\" document recorded in a given Journal collection. The author writing the <b>commentary</b> could view the design document in one window and his developing <b>commentary</b> document in another. He can easily establish <b>link</b>s in his <b>commentary</b> to cite any passage in the design document -- e.g., a <b>statement</b>, a term in the <b>statement</b>, or a diagram. Then this author would submit his <b>commentary</b> into the Journal, perhaps specifying a list of colleagues for \"distribution.\" Each listed user would automatically receive a mail item announcing this new Journal entry, giving subject, author, date, etc., and the all-important <b>link</b> to the new Journal <b>file</b> containing the <b>commentary</b>. Any such recipient can subsequently study both the <b>commentary</b> and its cited planning document in a similar, multi-window, <b>link</b>-assisted manner.<br><br>Furthermore, this second reader could develop and submit his own recorded <b>commentary</b>, which because of the citation power of AUGMENT <b>link</b>s could be as short and to the point as: \"Frankly, John, I think your comment in (DDD,xxx,aa) is a mistake! Didn't you notice the earlier assumption in (DDD,xxx,bb)? Maybe you should go back to Tom's earlier requirements document -- especially at (EEE,yy,cc).\" (Here, \"DDD\" and \"EEE\" represent Journal names, \"xxx\", \"yyy\", and \"zzz\" represent Journal item numbers, and \"aa\", \"bb\", and \"cc\" represent <b>address</b>es pointing to specific passages in those Journal <b>file</b>s.)<br><br>In official parlance, \"retrieval\" is the finding out about the existence of a relevant piece of information, whereas \"access\" is the subsequent process of gaining possession of the information. For users of AUGMENT's Journal system, retrieval is immensely facilitated by the widespread use of citation <b>link</b>s. When one can follow them as easily as can a practiced AUGMENT worker, these <b>link</b>s provide extremely effective retrieval support. We have supplemented this with some simple, automatically generated catalog <b>file</b>s, which made a rather nice balance. Access is provided by direct Jump on a reference <b>link</b> if the <b>file</b> is on line; if it isn't, AUGMENT asks the worker if she wants it retrieved, and a simple affirmative response automatically launches a request for the system operator to retrieve the <b>file</b> from its archive tape, after which the worker is notified of its availability via electronic mail.<br><br>A private document can be submitted into a Journal. In this case, only those <b>workers</b> listed at Journal-entry time can get access to the central copy. Such a private item would not be listed or indexed in the \"public\" catalogs.<br><br>We have used the Journal system very heavily since 1970 to support AUGMENT's development activity; many customers have employed it heavily since 1975. There are about 100,000 entries recorded in the original Journal now (I don't know about other, newer AUGMENT Journal collections). We found that as <b>workers</b> became at home in this environment, they were increasingly free about submitting their items to the \"public.\" It became evident that the scientific tradition of active and open interchange has some solid relevance to the collaborative processes in our smaller, \"colleague communities.\" Time and again a worker would come across others' dialog and be able to contribute some valuable information (sometimes a one-sentence comment with a critical citation <b>link</b>). Often the payoff went the other way: the new party found immediate value in an old piece of recorded dialog.<br><br>Shared-Screen Teleconferencing. Consider a case where two people sit down to work together at a terminal, where they can both see the screen(s), and where either one can take over the controls. This is being done countless times every day throughout the country, in different combinations of expert-expert, expert-novice, novice-coach, etc. When talking together on their telephones, two or more distantly separated AUGMENT users can collaborate in a manner very similar to this.<br><br>Suppose that two <b>workers</b>, Smith and Jones, want to set up and operate in a Shared-Screen Conferencing mode. Smith is in Princeton, working on <b>host</b> Office-4, and Jones is in San Francisco, working on <b>host</b> Office-12 -- and both of these <b>host</b> computers are connected to the same network. Assumedly they are in telephone contact when they decide to work in this shared-screen mode to collaborate on Smith's current job.<br><br>Jones will enter the <b>command</b> \"Share (display with user) SMITH! On <b>host</b> OF12! Viewing (other display)!!\"<br><br>Smith will enter the <b>command</b> \"Share (display with user) JONES! On <b>host</b> OF4! Showing (this display)!!\"<br><br>To give these <b>command</b>s, each person only entered the characters shown in upper case (entry case actually irrelevant), plus the digits, plus an \"OK Key\" action where each exclamation point is shown.<br><br>Whatever tool that Jones is currently using will continue responding to his controlling actions, as evidenced by various feedback and portrayal actions in the <b>windows</b> on his screen. Smith's screen image will clear, and be replaced with a replica of Jones' screen image -- multiple <b>windows</b> and all. For the duration of the shared-screen session, Smith's screen image will continue to replicate what is shown on Jones' screen.<br><br>There are provisions for passing control back and forth between <b>workers</b>. For instance, Jones can pass control to Smith so that Smith can show him some material or method of work. There are also provisions for the subsequent entry and departure of other conference participants.<br><br><br>EMBEDDING THE GRAPHIC ILLUSTRATIONS<br><br>For complete support of document development, it is important to provide integrated means for developing, viewing, and manipulating graphical portrayals. These portrayals should be part of the working <b>file</b>s from the very start, to be studied, passed about in mail, shared in Conferencing mode, edited, captioned, labelled, and moved about within the document structure. Furthermore, active, relevant citation <b>link</b>s pointing to these graphical constructs would be installed in and followed from <b>text</b>ual passages throughout the associated set of documents (including Mail and Journal documents).<br><br>AUGMENT's architecture and <b>file</b> structure were designed for this end, and a good bit of the associated implementation is in place.<br><br>A graphical data structure can be attached to any given <b>file</b> node, and there are basic capabilities for composing, studying, and modifying graphical diagrams. When formatting for a suitably equipped photo-typesetting device, there are formatting directives to designate the position and scale for placing these diagrams on a page. An AUGMENT <b>file</b> with integrated <b>text</b> and graphics can thus be mapped automatically onto a high-quality document whose pages contain both <b>text</b> and line drawings.<br><br>Our goal here was for what we call an \"illustrative graphics\" capability -- basic to which is a <b>command</b> that, when directed toward any conventional \"plotter\" <b>file</b>, will translate it into a diagram attached to a designated node. In this way we can make use of graphic constructs developed within almost any applications system, most of which have provision for outputting \"conventional\" plotter <b>file</b>s.<br><br>The most important next step is to adapt a bit-mapped display as an AUGMENT workstation, so the integrated <b>text</b> and graphics can be viewed and manipulated on the same screen. Heretofore, to do graphic work, an author has had to attach a Tektronix 4014 storage-tube display to the special printer/graphic port of her AUGMENT workstation. This has made use of AUGMENT graphics slow and expensive enough to limit the number of user groups who have developed the integrated use of mixed <b>text</b> and graphics.<br><br><br>CONCLUSION<br><br>AUGMENT's unique provisions stemmed for the most part from the conceptual framework within which AUGMENT was developed. For instance, consider the pervasive and significant changes in the environment in which humans will be doing their knowledge work. Note that the habits, methods, conventions, intuitions, etc., that comprise the \"ways\" in which we think, work and collaborate, are for the most part products of many centuries of cultural evolution -- in a radically different environment. With a radically different environment, this constant process of cultural evolution can be expected to take some radical turns.<br><br>The AUGMENT developmental framework assumed that many of these \"ways\" are candidates now for change in directions that heretofore would not have been beneficial. The AUGMENT system emerged as a first step in considering a few such changes, which perhaps can improve human capability for doing knowledge work because their new \"ways\" will enable us more effectively to harness the new tools toward more effective basic capability. (This is very different from trying to \"automate\" our old \"ways\" of doing things.)<br><br>As an example, consider the \"What You See Is What You Get\" (WYSIWYG) syndrome. It is a highly touted feature for many vendors. It provides a definite advantage for the final process of converting a computer-held document to a nicely formatted hard copy. But what does it do for <b>authors</b>hip? Well, in our framework, it has a negative impact. We were happy to abandon those constraints of lines and pages and other formatting geometry which did not contribute to matters of content and structure. We have chosen instead to provide the <b>authors</b>hip process with structured <b>file</b>s, flexible <b>address</b>ing, flexible window-size viewing, level and truncation <b>viewspecs</b>, etc. -- things that would be awkward or impossible to provide in a WYSIWYG environment. This provides the <b>authors</b>hip phase with flexibility and power for studying and manipulating content and structure that we wouldn't consider trading off for WYSIWYG. Save it for the production phase.<br><br>Here is another bit of culture that deserves re-examination. Consider the dictum, \"Easy to learn, and natural to use.\" Or, \"User friendly.\" The question is, for whom are you judging that things will be easy, or natural, or friendly? For designers of craft-work tool systems, very different perceptions of this issue are warranted between a system for the occasional, weekend do-it-yourself person and a system to be heavily used day after day by professionals. The AUGMENT User Interface System enables us easily to configure either kind of a tool collection.<br><br>This paper describes part of what is provided to professional knowledge <b>workers</b> who do a significant amount of <b>authors</b>hip work. We observe no more difficulty in their learning how to employ this relatively large collection of tools than one would expect for professional wood<b>workers</b> in their learning about the relatively large collection of chisels and other tools of their trade.<br><br>It is a basic part of our framework that, to augment human knowledge <b>workers</b>, attention must be given not only to tools, but to methods and skills as well. Because of space limitations, the scope of this paper was restricted to a summary of those tool provisions within AUGMENT that especially facilitate the <b>authors</b>hip process. A full description of \"How to use AUGMENT to ...\" would definitely need to include methods of work that effectively harness these tool provisions, and the special kinds of skills that yield unique payoff in executing these methods. This is true for every tool system, of course, but it seems especially true in this case because many AUGMENT provisions do not fit into the general cultural background of our <b>authors</b>hip process.<br><br>Perhaps the best way for very brief summarization of what AUGMENT's users feel about its unique features is simply to say that those who leave its working environment really miss them.<br></div>",

        "full": "<div>When I left Glen's group, I spent a year working for Lytton Industries on the ground control system supporting a precursor to Skylab. Then I went to a conference that was being held up in San Francisco. It was the Fall Joint Computer Conference. This particular conference was very, very special for me and for a lot of people because there was an hour and a half session in which Douglas Engelbart from the Augmentation Research Center at SRI in Menlo Park, California, gave a live video demonstration of a highly interactive computer <b>graphics</b> and computer text manipulation system that had been developed at SRI. I went to that particular session not knowing what to expect, and I was completely blown away. I happened to find afterward the particular person who seemed to be in charge technically; his name was Bill English. I cornered him and said, \"This is really nifty and I think I can help you.\" And he said, \"We're looking for a few good men. Why don't you come by?\" The next week I went by and the personnel department said, \"No, we have no openings.\" I said, \"Wrong. I'm going to sit here until Bill English comes to talk to me.\" (I was fairly bold in those days.) And he did. They hired me, and it was the beginning of a seven-year effort on my part at SRI with Doug Engelbart. A great many of the concepts that people now think of as commonplace, like the mouse and multiple windows, editing across windows, integrated text and <b>graphics</b> all those things originated, from my point of view, from Doug and his group at SRI. I'd like to introduce Doug Engelbart and his perspective of the last 20 years or so. <br><br>Doug Engelbart is a pioneer in the design of modern interactive computer environments. He holds the patent on the mouse; created the first two dimensional editing system, and was the first to demonstrate such things as the use of remote procedure protocols, mixed text <b>graphics</b>, and shared screen viewing. Doug holds a B.S. in EE from Oregon State University and a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of California at Berkeley. His career has led him from the U.S. Navy as an electronics technician to NASA's Ames Research Laboratory and then to Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) where he led the team that designed and built the NLS \"Augmented Knowledge Workshop.\" From January 1977 to March 1984 Doug was a Senior Scientist at Tymshare, Inc., Cupertino, California. In 1984, Tymshare was acquired by McDonnell Douglas. Doug continues as a Senior Scientist in the Information Systems Group, promoting the type of integrated system architecture conceived and implemented by him at SRI International.<br><br>The story of my involvement with on line <b>workstations</b> begins in early 1951 with a vision and a lifetime professional commitment. Over 34 years of pursuit have created a lot of personal history, and the object of this historical exercise, the workstation, occupies a unique place in it. For me, a workstation is the portal into a person's \"augmented knowledge workshop\" the place in which he finds the data and tools with which he does his knowledge work, and through which he collaborates with similarly equipped workers. I consider that the large system of concepts, skills, knowledge, and methods on the human side of the workstation has to be taken into account, in a balanced way, when pursuing increased human effectiveness. So, my workstation history story embraces a rather large sphere. The task of writing an historical piece is unfamiliar enough to cause me difficulty by itself, but the associated stirring of old records and old memories has added a nearly overwhelming burden of dreams, event s, people, stresses, pleasures, disappointments the firsts and the failures. <br><br>Now, what from all of this and how to organize it will make an appropriate \"history\" paper? I could provide a solid measure of objective reporting events and dates. I have been an involved observer of related computer history since 1951. I watched and experienced how the supportive hardware, languages, and architecture evolved; witnessed the people and efforts that brought timesharing into being; and was even more closely involved with the emergence of computer networks. Through all of this, I was wholly focused on what these things could do for people at <b>workstations</b>. And then there was office automation and personal computers; you don't have to be an old guy to have watched these emerge, but I'm sure they looked different to me than to most. I could also provide lots of objective reporting about the events and dates associated with the things I have caused or had a direct hand in. There seems to be a lot there that is quite relevant to this \"history of the workstation\" theme. It was dusty, laborious work, this process of brainstorming for candidates, culling and ordering and trying to describe them in some reasonable sequence and context. But what I came to realize is that there is one, clearly dominant factor that underlies essentially every cause for any uniqueness that I might list for historical record. It isn't a technology, it isn't a science, and it isn't a marketing or business mode l. And I am going to give it dominant coverage in this paper. It is what I call my \"Framework.\" <br><br>My Framework is based upon an intuitive conviction, implanted in my head (apparently permanently) over 30 years ago, that the gains in human knowledge work capability that we will achieve by properly harnessing this new technology will be very large. Metaphorically, I see the augmented organization or institution of the future as changing, not as an organism merely to be a bigger and faster snail, but to achieve such new levels of sensory capability, speed, power, and coordination as to become a new species a cat. Based upon this conviction about huge potential gains for mankind, my Framework explains for me generally where such gains are going to come from, and provides strategic principles that can help guide a conscious pursuit of these gains.<br><br>I was several years out of school, possessing a B.S. in electrical engineering and two years' experience during World War ll (halfway through college) as an electronics technician. I was doing odd job electrical engineering work at Ames Research Laboratory in Mountain View, California, with the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA, forerunner of NASA). For several months I had been devoting most of my spare time to searching for professional goals; for some reason I wanted to invest the rest of my heretofore aimless career toward making the most difference in improving the lot of the human race. I had initially dashed off in many fanciful directions, but yet managed enough interludes of reasonably sober thinking to build up some useful, strategic generalizations. Retreading myself professionally, to become proficient and then extraordinarily productive in some new field wasn't worth considering without a significantly attractive scenario, embedded in a reasonably structured strategic <b>framework</b>. The high payoff scenarios all seemed to involve creating or joining something that, however disguised, would essentially be a crusade. Crusades have many strikes against them at the outset. <br><br>In particular, they don't connect to a normal source of government or business revenue. They don't have nice organizational <b>framework</b>s. You can't go out on the streets and expect to find financial, production, or marketing vice-presidents interested in the crusade. Moreover, even if you accomplish the sweeping change that is the ultimate objective, chances are that in this very complex world the side effects might be bad enough to make you wish you hadn't tried. Suddenly, up through all of this delightful, youthful abstraction bobbed the following clear realization: The complexity of the human situation was steadily increasing; not only that, but its rate of increase was increasing. Along with the increasing complexity had come a general increase in the urgency associated with the more critical problems. If one invented a measure for each of these complexity and urgency then for a given problem, the product of its complexity times its urgency would represent a fair measure of the difficulty mankind would find in dealing with that problem.<br><br>The imagery of FLASH 3 evolved within a few days to a general information environment where the basic concept was a document that would include mixed text and graphic portrayals on the CRT. The imagery carried on to extensions of the symbology and methodology that we humans could employ to do our heavy thinking. There were also images of other people at consoles attached to the same computer complex, simultaneously working in a collaboration mode that would be much closer and more effective than we had ever been able to accomplish. Within weeks I had committed my career to \"augmenting the human intellect.\" In a few month s, I left the NACA and enrolled as a graduate student at UC Berkeley, where Professor Paul Morton had started a computer science activity (although it would be many years before universities began calling it that). He was several years along in developing the California Digital Computer (CALDIC). Within a few years I had to accept the fact that research on any kind of interactive computer applications would not provide me with a program acceptable to the university community for Ph.D. and later faculty pursuit. So, I settled for something else, got my Ph.D., and went to Stanford Research Institute (SRI) where I hoped ultimately to promote support for an augmentation program.<br><br>That was 1957. By 19591 was lucky enough to get a small grant from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR, from Harold Wooster and Rowena Swanson) that carried me for several years not enough for my full time work, but by 1960 SRI began pitching in the difference. It was remarkably slow and sweaty work. I first tried to find close relevance within established disciplines. For a while I thought that the emergent Al field might provide me with an overlap of mutual interest. But in each case I found that the people I would talk with would immediately translate my admittedly strange (for the times) statements of purpose and possibility into their own discipline's <b>framework</b>. When rephrased and discussed from those other perceptions, the \"augmentation\" pictures were remarkably pallid and limited compared to the images that were driving me. <br><br>For example, I gave a paper in 1960 at the annual meeting of the American Documentation Institute, outlining the probable effects of future personal support use of computers. I discussed how a focus on personal support would change the role of their future systems and how such a change would enable more effective roles for the documentation and information specialists.' I received no response at all at the meeting. One reviewer gave a very ho hum description of the paper as the discussion of a (yet another) personal retrieval system. Later, during a visit to a high caliber research outfit, an information retrieval researcher got very hot under the collar because I wouldn't accept his perception that all that the personal use augmentation support I was projecting amounted to, pure and simple, was a matter of information retrieval and why didn't I just join their forefront problem pursuits and stop setting myself apart?<br><br>Then I discovered a great little RAND report written by Kennedy and Putt' that described my situation marvelously and recommended a solution. Their thesis was that when launching a project of interior new discipline nature, the researcher would encounter consistent problems in approaching people in established disciplines. They wouldn't perceive your formulations and goals as relevant, and they would become disputative on the apparent basis that your positions were contrary to \"accepted\" knowledge or methods. The trouble, said these authors, was that each established discipline has its own \"conceptual <b>framework</b>.\" The enculturation of young professionals with their discipline's <b>framework</b> begins in their first year of professional school. Without such a <b>framework</b>, tailored for the goals, values, and general environment of the respective discipline, there could be no effective, collaborative work. Furthermore, if such a conceptual <b>framework</b> did not already exist for a new type of research, then before effective research should be attempted, an appropriate, unique <b>framework</b> needs to be created. They called this <b>framework</b> creation process the \"Search Phase.\" <br><br>So, I realized that I had to develop an appropriate conceptual <b>framework</b> for the augmentation pursuit that I was hooked on. That search phase was not only very sweaty, but very lonely. In 1962, I published an SRI report entitled, \"Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework.\" With the considerable help of Rowena Swanson, this was condensed into a chapter of a book published in 1963.J I can appreciate that these <b>framework</b> documents appear to many others as unusably general and vague. But, for me, the concepts, principles, and strategies embodied in that <b>framework</b> look better and better every year. The genesis of most of what was and is unique about the products of the augmentation work can be traced back to this <b>framework</b>, which I'll return to later with a fuller description.<br><br>I submitted many proposals before getting support to pursue the augmentation program outlined in the Framework report. Among the stream of politely phrased regrets, there was one that, in contrast to today's environment, can provide useful perspective on the environment of 1961. Four high  quality civilian experts had been enlisted by one agency as a site visit team a brain researcher, a psychologist, and a computer expert and for me it was a very enjoyable day's dialog. But the subsequent letter from the agency informed me regretfully that (paraphrased) \" . . . since your interesting research would require exceptionally advanced programming support, and since your Palo Alto area is so far from the centers of computer expertise, we don't think that you could staff your project adequately.... \" When J. C. R. Licklider (\"Lick\") came from Cambridge to take over ARPA's newly formed Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) in late 1962, 1 was figuratively standing at the door with the \"Conceptual Framework\" report and a proposal. There the unlucky fellow was, having advertised that \"man computer symbiosis,\" computer time-sharing, and man-computer interfaces were the new directions. How could he in reasonable consistency turn this down, even if it was way out there in Menlo Park? Lick moved very swiftly. By early 1963 we had a funded project. <br><br>But, whereas I had proposed using a local computer and building an interactive workstation, Lick asked us instead to connect a display to the System Development Corporation's (SDC's) ANIFSQ32 computer, on site in Santa Monica, to do our experimenting under the Q32's projected new time-sharing system. (Converting the Q32 to be a timeshared machine was SDC's IPTO project.) Later that year, our project was modified to include an online data link from Menlo Park to Santa Monica, with a CDC 160A minicomputer at our end for a communication manager, supporting our small display workstation. For various reasons, not uncommon in pioneering ventures, that first year was very unproductive relative to the purposes and plan of our project. Lick was willing to put some more support into the direct goal (more or less as originally proposed), but the support level he could offer wasn't enough to pay for both a small research staff and some interactive computer support. <br><br>Mind you, the CDC 160A, which was the only commercially suitable minicomputer that we knew of, even though having only 8K of 12-bit words, and running at about 6 microseconds per instruction, cost well over $100,000 (1963 dollars). It had paper tape in and out; if the system crashed, you had to load the application program from paper tape, and the most recent dump of your working file (paper tape), before you could continue. A crude, industry-standard Flexowriter (online typewriter) could be driven; otherwise it was paper tape in and out. What saved my program from extinction then was the arrival of an out-of-the-blue support offer from Bob Taylor, who at that time was a psychologist working at NASA headquarters. I had visited him months before, leaving copies of the Framework report and our proposal. I had been unaware that meanwhile he had been seeking funds and a contracting channel to provide some support. The combined ARPA and NASA support enabled us to equip ourselves and begin developing Version 1 of what evolved into the NLS and AUGMENT systems. Paul Fuhrmeister, and later Eugene Gribble of NASA's Langley Research Center, had to stick out their necks as successive heads of Langley's large computational division to support the direction and supervise NASA's support for our program, which continued several years after Taylor left NASA to join ARPA's IPTO office. Our ARPA support grew and was fostered by Lick's successors Ivan Sutherland, Bob Taylor, and Larry Roberts. <br><br>Meanwhile, the Air Force's Rome Air Development Center, at Rome, New York, began to supply supporting funds. By 1967, it was recognized that the respective contributions from ARPA, NASA, and RADC represented significant parts of a coordinated program. The other agencies began funneling their funds through RADC, which served for many years to both monitor and manage our contracts, as well as provide their own significant share of support funds. John McNamara and Duane Stone provided strong support and contract liaison from RADC. NASA support ended by 1969, and ARPA and RADC provided significant support until 1977, although from 1974 the funding became even more for supporting applications and developments for other organizations, for targets formulated by others (e.g., the National Software Works). The continuing pursuit of augmentation along my strategic vector virtually stopped.<br><br>An historically important organizational cluster emerged at Stanford Research Institute in the 1960s, peaked about 1974, and was scattered in 1977 with a small core carrying forth in a commercial (and then industrial) environment to the present. I t grew by ones and twos from 1963, as it collected \"permanent\" members from the SRI technical staff, and recruited new ones from the outside. By 1969 I believe we were about 18 strong; this grew steadily until by 1976 we totaled about 45. In 1973 we made two explicit subgroups, one headed by Dick Watson doing development of software (and some hardware), and one headed by Jim Norton handling operations and applications support. SRI was organized by divisions, each containing a group of laboratories, the hierarchy being formed according to the associated disciplines. ARC grew to laboratory size and status, but it became something of a problem for SRI. Other laboratories (at least in science and engineering) operated more or less as a \"farmers' market,\" where small and changing clusters of researchers promoted and conducted research projects as a loose federation. The management structure, budgeting, accounting, and financing for the Institute had evolved to support this kind of business. <br><br>But ARC was driven by a coherent, long-term pursuit. This involved the continuing evolution of an ever larger and more sophisticated system of hardware and software. It also came to involve delivering solid support service to outside clients to provide meaningful environments for learning about the all-important process of coevolution between the human system and tool system components of our organizations (as per my conceptual <b>framework</b>). It didn't seem unreasonable to me to pursue this course; things similar and on a grander scale are common for other researchers. It is taken for granted, for example, that funding agencies will build and operate accelerators and observatories in support of research in nuclear physics and astronomy, or will outfit ships and airplanes to support research expeditions. But whatever my perception, there were some significant problems and stresses with which our overall environment didn't have effective ways to cope. In the particular dynamics involved, there were probably seven relevant parties: me, the ARC staff, other SRI researchers, SRI management and administration, ARC's sponsors, ARC's utility service clients, and other groups of researchers outside of SRI. It would be an interesting historical study to try to understand the diversity of perception that must have existed among this set of players. <br><br>What did the different parties perceive for the future of <b>workstations</b>, for the range of function and application that would come about, for the systems architectures and standards that must emerge, and for the impact on the organizations that learned how to harness these most successfully? Even as a central party in what happened, l've not understood the dynamics. But I am pretty sure that disparities among the perceptions of all of the above parties had a major part in what to me was the \"great collapse of SRI ARC.\" Even if I had done everything right over the years (a laughable hypothesis), it is now fairly clear to me that it isn't the market's fault if someone fails in trying to sell it something that the market isn't ready for. In other words, I can't blame those other groups. (Which of course makes for a personal problem, since during those times of black discouragement when one wants desperately to blame someone, there is only one candidate that guy at the head of the list.) In 1977, SRI judged it better to move our large system development and external service activities out from the research institute environment and into a suitable commercial environment. They advertised, entertained prospective bidders, made a selection, and negotiated a transfer of the business to Tymshare, Inc., of Cupertino, California. The system was renamed AUGMENT and marketed as part of Tymshare's integrated Office Automation services. In 1984, McDonnell Douglas Corporation acquired Tymshare, and the small AUGMENT business is now operated as the Augmentation Systems Division of the Computer Systems Company within the MDC Information Systems Group.<br><br>Let's take a look at some of the actual experiments we tried during the years from 1964 to 1968 at SRI. Around 1964 we got off the CDC 160A system, which in fact we were using as a personal system. This was our first, real, stand-alone machine.<br><br>Screen Selection Tests and the Mouse In those days the cost of getting display systems to work was very high. My strategic plan under the above-mentioned <b>framework</b> was to skip the then prevalent, interactive typewriters and focus from the outset on displays. My assumption was that there is a great deal to learn about how to harness highly interactive display capability, and by the time we really learned how, the prices would be down considerably. We wanted to start early experimenting with screen selection. The idea of working and interacting very actively with the display meant that we had to tell the computer what we were looking at, so we needed a screen selection device. There was a lot of argument about light pens and tracking balls in those days, but none of those arguments served our needs very directly. I wanted to find the best thing that would serve us in the context in which we wanted to work text and structured items and interactive commands. The context was important. So we set up computer-controlled experiments oriented to our working mode, where we assumed that purposeful knowledge workers would be spending a significant portion of their time writing, studying, analyzing, and even debugging. <br><br>We collected a set of candidate screen selection devices to test. </div><div id='full_0'><mark>We did our experiments with our one workstation of that period, which is shown in Fig.</mark></div><div> 1, together with one of our test devices. In trying to be complete about the array of test devices, I dug up some old notes of mine de scribing a possibility that eventually turned into the very first mouse (Fig. 2). The tests were carefully run, and we even integrated selection errors and their correction penalties in evaluating the \"goodness\" of a de vice. The experiments and their results were fully reported, 5 and later described in a paper 6. The graph in Fig. 3 is representative of our results. The mouse consistently beat out the other devices for fast, accurate screen selection in our working context. For some months we left the other devices attached to the workstation so that a user could use the device of his choice, but when it became clear that everyone chose to use the mouse, we abandoned the other devices.<br><br>No one is quite sure why it got named a \"mouse,\" or who first started using that name. None of us would have thought that the name would have stayed with it out into the world, but the thing that none of us would have believed either was how long it would take for it to find its way out there. We also experimented with a way to move your knee up and down or swing it sideways to move the cursor, so you could keep your hands on the keyboard (Fig. 4). 1 also built something that allowed one to control the cursor movement by rotating your head for sideways cursor control, or nodding your head up or down for vertical cursor control. This \"nose-pointing control\" of the cursor left both hands free to operate the keyboard. In each case, some muscles would cramp up. Really, in almost any of these cases, you can get used to things like that. I'm sure there are a lot of things to explore in the future about what is going to work best for interfacing, so that you can tell the computer to which objects on the screen you want to direct its attention. However, we had many things to do, so it was a diminishing return for us to pursue these alternative devices we stayed with the mouse. I have always assumed, though, that something better than the mouse is likely to emerge once the user market becomes more adventurous in exploring the means to higher performance.<br><br>The first time-sharing system we got was an SDS940. We considered a number of alternative ways to provide ourselves with a flexible, responsive display system, and finally designed our own. The computer and display drivers timeshared their attention among multiple, 5-inch CRTs, which happened to be the most economical size for a given percentage of screen resolution. In front of each CRT we added a commercial, high quality video camera, mounted with a light shroud over the camera lens and CRT screen (Fig. 5). The resulting video signal, amplified and piped out to our laboratory, drove the video monitors that were our workstation displays. Two display generators, each driving up to eight CRTs, implemented with vacuum tube technology were both bulky (Fig. 6) and very costly. It took one and a half people to keep those things running all of the time. The stroke-generated characters and vector <b>graphics</b> allowed us to have flexible, mixed text and graphic document presentations. The display generators were driven from a direct memory access channel that provided very fast (i.e., one refresh cycle time) creation of a new display image. Figure 7 is a picture of one of our <b>workstations</b> the TV monitor, with a little wooden table we made and a keyboard and a mouse and a keyset. <br><br>We explicitly designed for a detached keyboard. My workstation design philosophy was to fix it so what you are looking at is positioned for best viewing, and the devices you use to control the computer should be located where it is best for you to operate them. Don't get caught in the anachronism that because we got used to paper and pencil and that technology, we ought to be able to have our controls right on the surface of the thing that we're working on. It may end up that way is best, but don't make an a priori assumption. So we didn't. One way of explaining to somebody why it could make a significant difference if you can do things faster, is to provide a counter example. So, I had them write with a brick taped to their pencil (Fig. 8), because it's only a matter of happenstance that the scale of our body and our tools and such lets us write as fast as we can. What if it were slow and tedious to write? A person doesn't have to work that way very long before starting to realize that our academic work, our books a great deal would change in our world if that's how hard it had been to write. What if you speed it up? The keyset shown in Fig. 9, in combination with the mouse, provides a two-handed, higher speed option. When you strike a chord, the computer interprets it as a character not really distinguishing between characters generated by keyset or keyboard. Our chord character code (a binary counting scheme mapped to the alphabet) is not really very difficult, my six year old kids took less than a week to learn it. At SRI, we had a project in the early 1960s to experiment with computer-aided, psychomotor skill training, and we used this keyset skill for the very first thing to be learned. The experiment blew up because everybody learned it so fast we couldn't differentiate between those who did and those who didn't have special computer aids. Figure 10 is sort of the picture that I think about when I'm told that we've got to make it easy to learn. Tricycles are \"easy to learn and natural to use\" no hard balancing problems. <br><br>How much is it worth to you to extend your mobility? A few hours of learning to balance on two wheels? </div><div id='full_2'><mark>By 19681 had a workstation like the one in Fig.</mark></div><div> 11 in my office, and I just started \"living\" on it. In our lab we had six to ten more, timeshared among our group. The whole feeling was great. It was a very, very interesting sort of activity in those days. Who says we didn't do workstation research? </div><div id='full_1'><mark>This one, our \"Yoga Workstation\" (Fig.</mark></div><div> 12 with Bill Duval), got to be one of the favorites for some reason. This is what you saw all the time people sitting there in their two-handed working mode, occasionally switching to type on a keyboard. Figure 13 shows Bill English with a workstation made for us by the Herman Miller office furniture company, who were trying to experiment with us. This little console swiveled on one of the chairs and went where you went; you could lean back and work with it very nicely. I wanted to show this workstation and Bill English, who de serves an immense amount of credit for getting things to work. I waved my hands and pointed, and somehow didn't make much progress. But Bill really made things work in those days, so I owe him a lot.<br><br>By 1968 we had a marvelous system. We called it \"NLS\" (later \"AUGMENT\"). \"NLS\" stood for \"online system,\" in contrast to \"offline system,\" which we dubbed \"FLS\" just to have different acronyms. A few people would come and visit us, but we didn't seem to be getting the type of general interest that I expected. I was looking for a better way to show people, so we took an immense risk and applied for a special session at the ACMIIEEE CS Fall Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco in December 1968. We set up to give an online presentation using a video projector pointing at a 20-foot screen. Brooks Hall is a large auditorium, and that video projector could put up our display images so you could read them easily from up in the balcony (Fig. 14). The video projector we rented (built by a Swiss company, Eidophor) used a high-intensity projection lamp whose light was modulated by a thin film of oil, which in turn was modulated by the video signal. On the right side of the stage, I sat at our Herman Miller console. We set up a folding screen as a back drop behind me. I saw the same image on my workstation screen there as was projected for the audience to see. We built special electronics that picked up the control inputs from my mouse, keyset, and keyboard and piped them down to SRI over a telephone hookup. We leased two microwave lines up from our laboratory in SRI, roughly 30 miles. It took two additional antennas on the roof at SRI, four more on a truck up on Skyline Boulevard, and two on the roof of the conference center. It cost money running that video projector, and getting people to help us do all of that, cost money; making the special l/O cost money; and leveraging special remote presentation technology on top of our advanced, developmental laboratory technology created extra risk and I was using research money. The nice people at ARPA and NASA, who were funding us, effectively had to say, \"Don't tell me!\" because if this had flopped, we would have gotten in trouble. <br><br>But anyway, it worked, and the main reason was because of Bill English's genius for making things work. Back in our lab, we dismantled a number of the display units in our display system, so that we could use the cameras in San Francisco and SRI. We borrowed a few tripods and got some extra people to be camera people. One of our friends, Stuart Brand, who was at that time working on his first Whole Earth Catalog, helped as well. So it was really a group project; there were about 17 of us. On my console on the stage, there was a camera mounted that caught my face. Another camera, mounted overhead, looked down on the workstation controls. In the back of the room, Bill English controlled use of these two video signals as well as the two video signals coming up from SRI that could bring either camera or computer video. Bill could select any of these four video images with optional mixing and frame splitting. We had an intercom that allowed him to direct the action of the people in our lab at SRI who were generating computer images or handling the cameras sending the video up from SRI. <br><br>We didn't use any specially made system capabilities; we were just using NLS the way it worked at that time. It had mixed text and <b>graphics</b>, so we could use those to display and represent things. We had the agenda in NLS, and we could run different parts and show diagrams; we could do things as examples. So it was a mix of things of: here's the script and stuff to tell you about, and here's the way it runs; we could also bring other display screens or faces, from our SRI lab, in and out on the screen. At that time we firmly imagined that this was the way future conferences would be run. We could do screen splitting. Figure 15 shows the agenda list with a little marker to show that I'm between two particular items. In Fig. 16, I make a temporary (shopping) list. This was the beginning of our demonstrating ways of structuring ideas. The NLS system supported the user in getting the list organized into categories. We wanted to show how the mouse works. The projected video showed Don Andrews controlling a cursor from our SRI laboratory by moving his mouse around. The superimposed video image of the display screen showed that the cursor would follow it exactly to show how the wheels worked. <br><br>Remember, this was 1968 the first public appearance of a mouse. I could also show how the simultaneous use of mouse and keyset worked in such a way that the audience could watch my hands in the lower window and see the computer action in the upper window. Then we brought in Jeff Rulifson to tell about how the software works (Fig. 17). At the same time, his face could be brought in and out behind the display image that he was working with, demonstrating NLS's power for working with very explicitly structured software. He showed graphical diagrams that were embedded in the source code documentation. </div><div id='full_4'><mark>During Jeff's presentation, Bill English brought the picture from a laboratory camera that caught the view (Fig.</mark></div><div> 18) of Jeff's keyset operation as he was manipulating his demonstration images unconscious and unhurried a nice way to show the fluid speed offered by combined mouse and keyset use. </div><div id='full_3'><mark>Toward the end, we also showed that we could cut a \"hole\" in the screen and see Bill Paxton's face from SRI (Fig.</mark></div><div> 19). For the computer display part of the screen, we could switch back and forth between his work and mine; and we could also switch which of us was controlling all of this. The associated FJCC publication about NLS and other relevant references are listed at the end of this paper.<br><br>You can't imagine the relief when it worked. It went on for 90 minutes, and afterward we thought for sure that the world would be talking about everybody starting to augment now. Well, it didn't happen, but we went ahead anyway. I want to discuss a few of the things we did physically to the system after that, and then go into some of the conceptual <b>framework</b>.<br><br>We began design of windowing capability for NLS.<br><br>We developed concept of a user \"reaching through\" his personal work place (i.e., his familiar online working files and application programs) to access less basic, specialized data and application processes (and other people); that is, the \"reach through\" should provide access to these, translated by the integrated support system, so as to appear as coherent parts of his familiar, personal work place.<br><br>We specified our first mail and \"Journal\" system as part of an explicit pursuit of a \"Dialog Support System,\" planning for it to be part of our ARPANET NIC service.<br><br>We developed document outputting capability processing our composite, text graphic document files to drive a service bureau, CRT based, full page, Stromberg Carlson photo printer to produce documentation with <b>graphics</b> and text mixed on the same pages.<br><br>We became the second host on the ARPANET with our SDS 940. (UCLA was first, UCSB next, then the University of Utah, then ...)<br><br>Detailed use of NLS began for internal management processes of ARC: cost records, working forecasts, purchase requisitions, and so on. <br><br>We began using the ARPANET to facilitate our reprogramming of NLS for the forthcoming PDP 10 TENEX. The University of Utah had a TENEX on the network, and we used NLS on the 940 to write our new PDP 10 code; using our tree meta compiler, we developed a cross compiler for our 940 that produced PDP 10 relocatable binary code. We would ship that over the net for loading and debugging on Utah's TENEX. When the two computers and the intervening network link were all working properly (lots of \"flat tires\" as in the early days of automobiles), our programmers would do all of this back and forth transitioning \"through\" the same workstation. I think that it was not only a record making way of working, but the NLS transport task was accomplished in remarkably short time (we attributed part of the efficiency to the network, and part to the use of NLS).<br><br>We brought NLS up on the PDP 10 TENEX with improved and new features (including multiple windows). The transfer process, and a detailed description of the design changes and new features for NLS are described in a June 1971 technical report 9.<br><br>We began using our Mail/Journal system within our group. Integrated into NLS, this assumed that a mail item was a document so any part of all of an NLS document could be sent and provided for a permanent record in explicitly retrievable form (our Journal). As an electronic mail system, this was quite advanced. It had a directory service (our Ident System) to provide mail relevant information about registered users; mail distribution was addressed by people's Idents, with no need to know or specify which host they used. Fields were provided for superseding other items, and for attaching keywords. An online index was provided for stored items.10<br><br>We began developing our first, integrated Help system.<br><br>We formulated the \"AKW Architecture,\" implemented in stages. \"<br><br>We implemented the \"shared screen,\" televiewing mode of online collaboration between two or more NLS users.<br><br>We brought up a table subsystem in NLS.<br><br>We designed our first, totally modular user interface system, as later described in the OAC '82 Digest, 13 and got it running on a PDP 11 that talked to our TENEX through the network, via our procedure call protocol.<br><br>We developed our line processor, as described by Don Andrews. It incorporated Intel's first microprocessor (the 4004) in a special box that was inserted in the communication line between a dumb display terminal and a modem. This made use of our virtual terminal protocols, and managed a multi window, two dimensional screen using off the shelf, \"dumb\" display terminals. Our mouse and keyset input devices were plugged into the line processor, which appropriately translated their actions to control cursor position and special communications to the host. A printer port on the line processor provided local printout service; a special communication protocol allowed the host to send printer packets mixed in with display support packets.<br><br>We finalized specification for our network virtual terminal, something that has become a key part of our architecture. The objective, on the one hand, was to free the application programmers from worrying about the special features of different <b>workstations</b>, and on the other hand, to enable more flexible evolution by users of <b>workstations</b> they may adopt to fit particular needs. As part of this, there was a terminal independent display manipulation protocol for communication from application program to terminal, and an application independent input protocol for communicating from terminal to application program.<br><br>We generalized the file structure of our document files to provide for generalized property structures associated with each addressable object, intended to accommodate composite integration of such as <b>graphics</b>, digitized speech, scan  coded images, or any other arbitrary data form.<br><br>We gave up our high performance, local display system for the line processor supported, remote display system to make ourselves live with the same remote services as our NIC clients and Utility customers. (On principle, we gave up our integrated, direct view <b>graphics</b> and the fast response of our direct memory access, local display generator.)<br><br>We opened our \"Workshop Utility Service.\" Delivering NLS service over the ARPANET to DOD customers as pilot applications of office information service. We had gone out on bid for commercial time sharing services, selected Tymshare Inc. of Cupertino, Calif.; their host, named Office 1, provided the computer service. We fielded special trainers and application development staffs and cultivated special customer representatives into a spirited community.<br><br>We implemented our new, integrated <b>graphics</b> system, which could support remote display and manipulation of illustrative <b>graphics</b> on a Tektronix 4014 storage tube display plugged into the line processor's printer port. Figure 20 shows the graphic station setup used for development in our lab. Bob Belleville, to the right in the picture, developed this \"new\" <b>graphics</b> software. (He subsequently went to Xerox and helped them with the Star hardware, and then was the project manager for the Apple Macintosh.)<br><br>In 1973 we had generalized our file structure with provision for attribute value property structures associated with each hierarchic node. We could then embed arbitrary data objects in our documents. The first utilization w as to reinstate embedded <b>graphics</b>, extending our hierarchical list structure and its pointers to the text objects with, for example, an associated pointer on one of the text objects to a graphic substructure for the associated illustration. The user's concept would be shown in an associated \"document page\" image. We assumed that soon we would be using digitized speech strings and executable object code as part of our composite documents. And some day, when storage would be cheaper, we would even be embedding scanned images. An illustration produced as a plotter driver file by any other <b>graphics</b> system could be picked up and attached to a specified location in an NLS document, and could be subsequently viewed and modified with the NLS Graphics Subsystem. Figure 21 shows two such \"ingested\" illustrations, as viewed in two adjacent NLS graphic windows. Our use was oriented toward \"illustrative <b>graphics</b>,\" and we had a reasonably complete set of capabilities for construction and manipulation. <br><br>By this time, we had a well-developed Output Processor (our \"document compiler\"), which acted upon a large vocabulary of embedded text directives to provide font selection, columniation, running headers and footers, and much more.16 In conjunction with the Graphics Subsystem, the Output Processor was enhanced so that a user could direct that a properly scaled image of any graphic illustration be located appropriately within a multifont page layout. All this was available by 1975 1976. But the problem at the time was that for somebody to use this, they would have to buy a $10,000 or $15,000 storage tube terminal to go with the line processor and text terminal. We couldn't get past this business of \"if they don't have it, they don't know they need it; and if they don't know they need it, they don't want to buy it.\" <br><br>It was a little difficult at the time, so the <b>graphics</b> sort of atrophied until recently. The whole approach was that our files were document oriented documents in a very general sense. These are what contain the descriptions, arguments, proposals, whatever, the things you're trying to map your thoughts and arguments into to form a communication. Another thing we did, though, in 1967, was to help people collaborate in face to face meetings. Here again, Bill English whipped it all together very fast special small narrow tables that you could work around and sit at in a conference meeting, where the monitors were down low enough so you could see over them and see each other well. Each monitor had the same image that was brought from our one user 3100 at the time, but we had one workstation and some mice. Anybody who wanted to pick up a mouse and push the button could, and this would activate a large, special cursor that could be controlled and moved around, so any participant could point out things on the common display. <br><br>We had a review meeting among our sponsors at the time. The picture (Fig. 22) shows Bill English, Don Andrews, Dave Hopper, and Barry Wesler, who was Bob Taylor's assistant. Bob was in attendance at the time, too, participating in this conference. Another thing we did by 1970 was to bring up our electronic mail system as part of our collaboration. There was really a very sophisticated mail system with user identification, catalogs, and all sorts of fields that you could use to send and answer thing s. One extra feature was that you could send whole documents; it didn't matter whether it was a little one sentence note or a whole document. A document could go in and be catalogued into a system called the \"Journal,\" which was similar to the idea of pasting it down on a table (Fig. 23). We had linkages and internal addressability, so an embedded link in one document could directly cite an arbitrary passage in any other. Successive documents could be entered in the system and easily be cross referenced back to each other. This supported what we called our \"recorded dialog\" an important part that we assumed was needed for a community of people to work together effectively. It is an extremely powerful capability. <br><br>We originally designed our Mail/Journal system to give the user a choice as to whether to make an entry unrecorded (as in current mail systems), or to be recorded in the Journal. I knew that there would be lots of question, and some quandary, associated with the question \"to record or not to record.\" I assumed that many fewer items would be recorded than \"should be\" as might be judged after we someday would learn the value and establish criteria for recording. So, I ordained that all entries would be recorded no option. It put some people under considerable strain. I think that one person actually never could bring himself to enter a memo into the Journal the idea that it was \"forever\" stopped him cold. Another person, a very valuable contributor, somehow felt violently opposed to the basic concept, and it possibly hastened his departure. But after a year or so, it was used as a matter of course by essentially everyone. There were interesting and unexpected payoffs. Up until about 1975, we made a practice of printing out every one of the stored documents mostly as an alternate analytic process to watch the dynamics of Journal use. The documents are stored by number, in binders as shown in Fig. 24. This indicates how big our Journal collection got in about four or five years. The number now for that particular journal is well over 100,000 items. We have an arbitrary number of other journal systems that customer groups can install and administer themselves, a very powerful potential archive for collaborative work.<br><br>Let's now shift back to the conceptual <b>framework</b>, originally documented in a 1962 paper.'7 I had this immensely intuitive feeling that humans were going to be able to derive a great deal of capability from computer systems. I had very real images in my mind of sitting at a display console, interacting with a computer, seeing all sorts of strange symbology coming up that we could invent and develop to facilitate our thinking. We would no longer be limited to working with paper and other such laborious means. Other people could be sitting at similar consoles tied to their machine and we could be collaborating in brand new, exciting ways. We could be doing all sorts of things to control a computer. At that time, even though I didn't know how the innards of a computer worked, I had enough engineering background to know that if a computer could read a card, it could sense keys and any other action I might want to do. If it could drive a printer or card punch, it could put whatever I wanted onto a display. What I didn't understand at the time was the economics and all that, but I said, \"Look, I've got a whole career ahead of me, let's go after all of this.\" By 1959 or so, I got a chance to sit down and say, \"How would that really work? What are the basics?\" As an engineer, I ended up with a simplifying model (Fig. 25). <br><br>Here's a human wanting to do this knowledge work; he's got capabilities within his skin that we can make use of, a lot of mental capabilities we know of, and some of it he's even conscious of. Those are marvelous machines there motor machinery to actuate things in the outside world, and sensor and perceptual machinery to get the idea of what's going on. And that's what he has to support his interaction with the outside world. How can we improve the human's capability (Fig. 26)? Well, it turns out that there have been a lot of people working on this problem for many generations. And we've got a whole \"culture full\" of things that we are indoctrinated and trained into, both conscious things and unconscious things. We have lots of skills, motor wise and perception wise, that we're not even aware of. For example, just how long do you think it took to learn to brush your teeth? It takes quite a while; it's a skill. These sensory motor things all developed in order to help us interact with the layers of other things that our culture provides. Many such things are available to us, tools and methods that let us live within a social structure and be effective in our interactions. And there's a whole subset of tools and methods that help us be effective in dealing with knowledge work. So take all those things together and call them an \"augmentation system\" (Fig. 27). That's what augments humans. <br><br>And for good, practical purposes, let's divide the system into two parts. One part has all the technology in it and the other has all the rest. So I called these the \"tool system\" and \"human system.\" The human system includes training, knowledge, and skills that have to be installed as well as language, an extremely important invention that transcends, as an invention, anything else we have come up with. The methods, and all that we use to knit together all the little steps that we take during a day, are extremely important. Our customs for working, our procedures, the way our organizations are run, they're all done so that humans can realize effective results. Within this <b>framework</b>, any given capability that a human has is really a composite. The human capability is made up of the use of a lot of things and skills and training and conditioning, in addition to all the customs we just accept and the language that we've learned. It's this composite that we need to find ways to accentuate. So along comes a lot of new technology for our tool system, which is great. But the technology side, by itself, is not sufficient. Our real capabilities are essentially hierarchical (Fig. 28). We learn a lot of lower order capabilities, like writing and typing and reading. And we have built up many higher capabilities on top of these. So, if we bring in some new technology, like a longer lasting pen, it's going to make a little bit of effect. But if we bring in the kind of digital technology that was predictable, even in 1960, then potential changes throughout the whole system, affecting significantly the entire capability hierarchy, can begin to take place.<br><br>It takes a long time (generations) to discover and implement all of the fruitful changes in the human system made possible by a given, radical improvement in technology. Where, as is the situation now, technology improves by rapid, large steps, it is predictable that the human system will become critically stressed in trying to adapt rapidly in ways that formerly took hundreds of years. There has to be a much enhanced consciousness about concurrent evolution in the human system. The technology side, the tool system, has inappropriately been driving the w hole. What has to be established is a balanced coevolution between both parts. How do we establish an environment that yields this coevolution? Well, that's where the bootstrapping in a laboratory comes in. I said I wanted to do what I knew it was going to be like in our future. So we had to be more conscious of the candidates for change in both the tool and the human systems. Whenever you hear somebody say it has to be \"easy to learn and natural to use,\" put up a little flag and go question it. What's \"natural\"? Is there a natural way to guide a vehicle, as will reins? Well, that lasted a long time. No! What's natural is what we have grown to accept. <br><br>And if we look at how much learning it took to drive automobiles, and own and operate them, it would make ridiculous the things people save now regarding what they expect their computer system's learning to cost them. If it's going to be the kind of working companion that it's bound to be, then the learning part of it is relatively trivial. I know it's what sells now, because the market isn't very mature for people to buy things that look like they're going to be hard to learn. But I'm talking about the long term trends, and the responsibilities of people that are doing the research and downstream planning. l think they should start looking much more seriously for really significant gains in human performance and consider many more candidates for change, with special attention to the much neglected human system candidates. This will bring up lots of things that might not have been even thought of before, because now there is explicit, active \"prospecting\" for ways to do things differently. The mouse and the keyset came from trying to do something new in the tool system (similarly for structured files and their viewing and linking). I didn't realize at the time how strange they'd seem and how long it would take for people to start considering them. So then, how does the change take place? In a large organization (Fig. 29) there are lots of different parties taking part in a change. An idea for change in one place often \"needs\" help from another before the original idea can be implemented for example, one might ask if the mail room could make one more daily delivery. Then, when such a need is fulfilled by a change in capability of one of the \"lower\" parts, it provides new \"possibilities\" for change among the \"higher\" parts that depend upon it. <br><br>Evolution proceeds by reverberation: needs propagate downward, and when fulfilled, a new possibility propagates upward. Correspondingly, a possibility propagated by a new capability in a lower level place can trigger a new idea in a higher place. Continuing the example, we can improve our operation by taking advantage of the extra mail delivery, but we'd need the copy center to change. . . . Possibilities tend to stimulate new needs. So when we've got a fairly large organization, or large system of things, with specialists working all over the place that are responsible for changes in certain areas, there will have to be some extraordinary communicating to provide decade frame evolution on a scale previously requiring centuries. Changes once took place so slowly that we weren't really aware of the evolutionary process. People moved and finally heard about something and tried it. But now, with a catapulting rate of change, and the pressures to become more effective, the changes within our organizations are just going to exceed the rate that we know how to deal with. Unless people start getting conscious and understanding about the evolution, for many, many structures this fast changing rate is going to exceed the elastic limit, and things are going to break. So I said, \"What better place could you start putting to work the new tools and things than in the process that is going to facilitate the evolution you have to go through.\" That produced a strong push toward computerized documents, and toward collaboration among groups. <br><br>One way to look at how to use the computer to help work with documents would be the possibility of a conventional word processor approach. It's a very straightforward way. The orientation is to simulate paper on a display, targeted solely to produce hard copy. A considerable advantage in many situations, but it is a very anemic example of what the above <b>framework</b> promises. It didn't even enter my mind to go with that picture. Instead, what my <b>framework</b> produced is shown in Fig. 30. The motor capability of the abstracted human module drives the computer tools and employs the associated methodological and conceptual linguistic parts of his augmentation system in the special modes indicated. The result is quite a bit different from \"word processing\" and \"office automation.\"<br><br>For instance, we should have an open ended command vocabulary. Once we get hooked up to running in a more flexible environment, the computer tools must provide us with more and more functionality. Since we've got a very powerful beast that can do things, let's really look for fast control means where, for instance, we aren't limited to doing things sequentially, but can do things with both hands, concurrently. This stimulated the chord keyset option. I thought we should make it so that both content and structure can be stored and explicitly manipulated. Bring text and <b>graphics</b> together, because they're both important. Every object in a file should be addressable, because I wanted to do remote jumping and manipulation. So we developed a very flexible addressing scheme that seems to fit well with a user's mental map of his working domain and offers handy addressing options that, in any command, can optionally be used in place of cursor selection. One should be able to move around in existing files rapidly and precisely, and easily jump across any intervening \"file or content space\" to an explicitly prescribed position. The computer should help navigate throughout the entire working space. When I am positioned at a desired file object, I want to generate a view that will best serve my purpose of the moment. <br><br>So, we evolved a flexible set of \"view specifications\" that can be invoked at any time and an explicit opportunity is offered the user at any \"jump\" operation to designate \"ViewSpecs.\" For example, \"in this window, show only the first line of each statement, no blank lines between statements, show location addresses (e.g., \"3b4\") in front of each statement, show only the statements hierarchically \"under\" the targeted statement, and only those that are in the first two sub levels.\" A con tent filter, of any degree of sophistication, can be invoked within any such ViewSpec so that, among the candidate statements already specified, only those that have a given content will be show. Simple filters (e.g., to find a given embedded string) can be keyed in at any time and compiled on the fly. More sophisticated filter patterns can be stored as text strings that a user can specify with a \"Set Content Pattern\" command. Or, a programmer can write and compile very sophisticated filters that a user can easily designate by name to be instituted. <br><br>With a comprehensive addressing scheme it is easy to implement citation links, special text strings that both user and computer can interpret as addressing some object and also optionally specifying a particular view to be employed. \"Jumping on a link\" is a basic command, taking the user directly to the target object. A link can also be employed as part of the addressing in any other command u here some file object is to be specified. If I am moving around in somebody else's stuff, so I can study and analyze it much more effectively, I want to be able to train the displays myself, because a display may not look as I expect it to look when I'm looking at it straight down on paper, and indeed it doesn't. And do I want it also so that I can share that display with others, so that we can collaborate? And share files? So that's the image, and that's why NLS was designed as it was.<br><br>Now to discuss architecture. I'll use a series of simple illustrations to lead up to the general approach we settled upon. Consider, as in Fig. 31, an application program on top of an operating system in a computer, serving a terminal. For any such application program, there are two facets: an interface process and the actual process that does the substantive work two different parts. Let's think about them as two distinct but related design issues. For instance, I don't want the smart programmer who knows all about how this program works internally to think that he's the one to tell the world how to interface with it. By 1968 we had begun evolving the programming language so that it was different for each part, and we could actually think and design for two separate modules (Fig. 32). The next step was to ask, Why, for each different application package, should you have a different front end? Frontends should be universal things, as in Fig. 33, to serve multiple (or all) applications for the user. So our language ideas were evolving to handle this approach. The system that we brought up on the SDS940 in 1968 was organized along these lines, as shown in Fig. 34. All the subroutines that did the application work were written with our special, MOL940 language that we had to develop ourselves. <br><br>The control processes were specified in a control metalanguage, then com piled with a control metalanguage translator into the control processor, which interacted with the user. We had a tree meta translator that let us do our compiler compiling. We described a new compiler in a metacompiler language, then compiled it with the tree meta translator into the new, running compiler. Incidentally, in those days I would talk about control language and control metalanguage rather than the command language because I felt that we were doing a lot of things that normally people don't think of as commands. But the pressure of external world usage pulled us around so now we call it command language. It was really fortunate for us to be involved in the ARPANET from the beginning. My early ideas of \"community\" support services could be made explicit in planning for the Network Information Center. One of the papers I wrote pointed out that besides allowing us to share data and process resources, the emergent networks will also provide us with a knowledge marketplace that's wide open for people sitting at their terminals all over the world. Topologically, Fig. 35 depicts what we assumed by the early 1970s would be the future environment for knowledge workers.<br><br>Let's not argue about how much functionality is in any one place. To the user, it doesn't matter whether the <b>workstations</b> are smart or not, as long as they do what he wants them to do. So let's look at topology. The topology that we wanted (Fig. 36), involved a user interface system (UIS) that's between the user's physical interface hardware (display, keyboard, mouse) and all the \"smart\" application software. I don't care how much of these smarts are in his local workstation, but I'm never going to say that it all has to be there. Between the user interface system and all of the application systems is a \"virtual bus\" some UIS communication will be to applications in the local workstation, some to applications on the local  area network, and some may be far out through gateways to the UIS of a colleague. An important part of what we wanted to provide was a set of functions that the user thinks of as his private or \"local\" (topologically) workplace where he does his composing, studying, mail management, and calculations. But also he should be able to \"reach through\" his local workplace to get at all the other services. <br><br>The internal architecture of the UIS (Fig. 37) contains a virtual terminal controller (VTC) so all of the applications are programmed to deal with a standard, virtual terminal. The VTC translates to and from particular physical terminal l/O streams, enabling different classes of terminal equipment for different classes of users and also, importantly, makes evolution within the whole system easier. The command language interpreter (CLI) interprets the user actions according to the command language specification coded into the currently attached grammar file, which was created from a command metalanguage description via the command metalanguage compiler. The CLI also deals with a user specific, user profile file that enables individuals and classes of users to have independent control options. The procedure call interface (PCI) modules translate back and forth between the procedure call conventions of the various larger modules and the remote procedure call protocol we developed for use between arbitrary modules (including those connected via byte sequential network circuits). <br><br>We called this architectural configuration \"The Augmented Knowledge Workshop,\" and figured that all knowledge workers in the future would work in some such environment. The early <b>framework</b> concepts led us to believe that open ended functionality was inevitable. Also, it emphasized how essential it was to facilitate the coevolution of the human and tool systems. One important objective in this architectural approach was to support this coevolution: Hardware and software could be changed with minimum disturbance to the human system and, conversely, changes in terminology, methodology, and functional dependence upon the tools could evolve with minimum disturbance to the tool system. One way to illustrate payoff from this architecture is to consider the different profiles of functionality that different classes of users would likely want to employ as they look through their respective classes of terminals into their \"knowledge workshops.\" A high level project manager, a support clerk, or a skilled, heavy working professional can each work with grammar and user profile files that provide the functionality he or she needs, with command terminology and interaction modes suited to skill levels and ways of thinking. All of this architecture was working by 1976, although it has only been recently that we could interest user organizations in trying to harness it toward an integrated knowledge work environment. A number of our publications explicate various aspects of this architecture.19<br><br>It is important that the evolution of the user side should go on maximally; it has been badly neglected. The \"basic human unit\" is shown in Fig. 38. How are we going to evolve it? The reverberation concept of its evolution is very important in my <b>framework</b>, and I have come to believe that it is only done by what you'd call \"communities.\" Even in a large, highly structured organization much of the change process must involve stakeholders in groupings that are different from the line management structure (i.e., like a community). This is a big, important concept that started in the mid-1960s. If we depend critically upon a community that must interact in really effective collaboration, we need to build support systems especially designed for this purpose. Part of the conscious evolutionary process for our large organizations and institutions must therefore be to provide effective collaboration support for widely dispersed communities (Fig. 39). <br><br>But how was I going to promote an R&D program, with a \"pilot community,\" to learn how to develop and provide effective \"community support\" tools and associated new collaborative methods? Well, in the spring of 1967, at an ARPA principal investigators meeting, Bob Taylor and Larry Roberts told us that ARPA was going to make computer network R&D a major program thrust, and that our \"research computers\" were going to be the ones connected by an experimental \"ARPA Network.\" Even though many others were disturbed by the idea (because of perceived interference with their major research thrusts), I was thrilled. Finally, after listening to the initial interactions, I volunteered to develop and operate what became the ARPANET Network Information Center (NIC). What I wanted was for the NIC to become a community support center that would really go after the development of collaboration support tools and methods, and would provide services to encourage the ARPANET R&D folks to evolve their working ways accordingly. <br><br>Hopefully, there would emerge a sub community out there composed of those interested in the various aspects of augmenting (Fig. 40).Just consider the kind of leverage you get this way. So I've talked about a \"bootstrap community\" in my notes for over 15 years now, and it's something I still very much would like to see established (Fig. 41). Many features and capabilities built into NLS/AUGMENT were directly motivated by these community support and distributed collaboration concepts. Unfortunately, the ARPANET grew so fast that the Network Information Center had to trim down what it could do functionally. We couldn't provide the extensive support services we had planned (dis cussed at some length in a 1972 paper20), such as what we could do to support a community by integrating a lot of its dialog, and getting an intelligence system there; handbooks that evolved to integrate what to do; and professional facilitation staff, which adds important value. There is a lot that can be embedded in this. NLS/AUGMENT was built to be able to handle external document (XDOC) control, the community intelligence collection that everyone contributes to and participates in, and indexes to it. <br><br>When the community has a special mission or disciplinary interest, we also could significantly facilitate the development and maintenance of a \"dynamic community handbook\" that integrates current status (terminology, hypotheses, conventions, plans, expectations, and so forth) in a coherent, self-consistent fashion. Figure 42 portrays all of this community support in a fashion peculiar to the NLS/AUGMENT set of features and capabilities. While each user had his own collection of working files, there would be a large collection of shared information all of it embedded in uniform, composite document structures. The generalized citation link capability interconnects passages of any of these documents in meaningful ways as evolved with user conventions and collaborative methods. Ordinary, unrecorded mail and shared files gain significant value thereby. The Journal system provides its own unique value, considerably amplified with linkage use. <br><br>A \"community intelligence collection\" (CIC) can be distributed over all of the document types embodying useful information and discussion about external activities relevant to the community's interests. Special indexing into this collection is again much enhanced with links. The Community Handbook fits into the picture nicely; any given \"edition\" is \"published\" in the Journal (and is probably available also in corresponding hard copy), which is controlled with the XDOC system. I'm going to terminate at this point, since after 1976 we really had no chance to continue pursuing this \"augmentation <b>framework</b>.\" It seemed no longer to fit in the pattern of the research at ARPA, or with what SRI wanted to do. When we landed out in the commercial world, we found it wasn't what people there wanted to do, either. <br><br>The AUGMENT system stayed alive in sort of a funny, dumb way, often like taking a bulldozer in to help people work in their back yards. Then, McDonnell Douglas bought Tymshare, and inside of its aerospace organization it's a very different situation because of the very heavy knowledge work involved. For a year I've been going out and talking with all those people involved in big projects and CAD systems, and finding out that these concepts are directly relevant to the needs and problems now being recognized there. We're starting this year to build special interest communities. The first one is the AI community; possibly followed by the Ada community. Also, explicit consideration of integrated architectures similar to ours is under way, including not only virtual terminals, command interpreters, remote procedure calls, and shared screen support, but also composite documents with addressable objects and citation links. So that's a quick pass over my historical record.</div>",

</span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>I'm trying to show it to you and the arrangement is quite nice except the resolution of the camera coming down on the tubes won't quite let it be

</span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>But when it's doing that I'm going to have to do some very awkward things in order to know where I'm flying. </span><br><br><span

support knowledge workers in a very special way. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>In the last ten years I've been out in the commercial world and then went, McDonnell Douglas bought

onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>I'm supposed to get an optical pointer here, which would help. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>Otherwise I'll walk over here. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>This a report, published at SRI in 1962, that was after I'd been on this kick for eleven years, believe it or not and gotten a few years to put this together and I said, \"Well, I really feel like interactive computers are going to make a huge, huge difference in the capability of what now you'd call the knowledge worker.\" </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>Then I called it, sort of, augmenting the human intellect and there's a great deal in that framework that still sparks me on and most of the things we did came right out of it. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>We'll give a little bit of a preliminary description of that, very brief, so that'll orient you why I did it. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>There was a chapter in a book in 1963 that was included. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>It created a great wave of enthusiasm out in the world. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>The one response I got was somebody six months later asking me how you felt this acronym, H dash L-A-M slash P? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>I used it always, too, to represent my systems and it was stunning when he asked me that because I'd been working by myself all through these years to do this and I never

onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>As an engineer I said, \"Well let's do this.\" </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>This is what you begin with and these are a simplified model of how a human being has to face the world. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>You've got the model of perceptual machinery, motor machinery, quite a bit of mental machinery. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>Some of it he's conscious of and a lot he isn't. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>That's what he's equipped with to face the outside world. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>You realize that unless you add quite a big more to that, anybody's got that same thing, but what do you have to equip yourself to be capable of coping with the world? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>All right. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>In these general areas you need to provide more things. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>Generally most of that's provided by your culture as you grow up. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>You get inculcated with a lot of unconscious sort of attitudes and customs and things, you just assume the way things will get done. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>You soak up <b>linguistic</b> things in here and conceptual, and lots of explicit, symbolic, and <b>linguistic</b>, and things that are quite constant that you absorb. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>A lot of unconsciously accepted and perhaps unconsciously pursued skills, perceptual motor, and all of that is generally there so you can handle stuff out here that your culture provides you in order to cope with the world. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>So you say, \"Yeah.\" </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>There's a great deal already provided that augments the basic human so he can be capable out in the world. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>I started saying well let me just this that and pretty soon I'd realized there's been a fabulous amount of invention over all the generations. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>You're just overwhelmed. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>You're thinking, oh, you come along some bright-eyed jerk and he says, \"I've got all this computer stuff I think would be applicable\" and you realize there's been so much invention in the future and I almost quite. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>Then I got to thinking, \"Well, let's get a little more into this\" and you realize you toggle one set of those augmentation systems things that your technology can provide you with tools. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>These are just sort of representative kinds of things that would list in that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>And another set of things that aren't technology. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>These things the culture provides you and they generally match what you have here in order to give you capability. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>You have to have skills and knowledge that you're trained in in order to cope with all of these things. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>It came to be something like this. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>By the time a human was capable of something significant it really drew on all kinds of skills and knowledge developed in here that coordinated with what's provided here and here by his culture. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>That's what makes us capable. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>Without a system like this we're essentially helpless. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>You say, all right, technology can come here and do something quite significant and make a difference. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>Well, people start talking about automation. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>This is so you were going to use tools over here to automate what you're doing here now. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>But if your tools are radical enough over there the concept that just swept me off my feet was, wow, there's so much change you can do in here in order better to harness something really significant coming out over here. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>It's a real advantage in human capability wouldn't come and tell, you really got to balance development over here of the new means of thinking and working and even new <b>linguistic</b>s, very deep <b>linguistic</b>s sorts of things, concepts and portrayals and even the syntax that you use in your head as you work and think, will change a great deal. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>So that, to me, was what Augmentation was, and to start pursuing that the strategy, well, start building things here which make a difference and sort of bootstrap your way up. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>Learn, make the changes here. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>At the very outset in '62 when I finally got that put together the idea was, look for the changes here. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>That's what we've done and there've been aspects about this which grew into serious arc<b>hit</b>ectural things, too which I'll deal with very lightly before I go into some of the document sort of things. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>And that is if you <b>want</b> this to start changing and this to start changing they have to be sort of a coordinated co-evolution. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>You can't come up with a bunch of vendors and bright-eyed engineers and programmers, if you'll pardon the expression, that are going to produce new things that are going to tweak the world because over here there's a whole bunch of ways of changing that you can change and deal with your work that make a lot of difference in what you <b>want</b> to produce here. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>They really depend upon each other so it just should co-evolve. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>How do you get that going? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>How do you get some of the new dimensions of change over here started? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>That's what I was looking for, some of the new dimensions. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>In the older ones where it had a little bit about <b>linguistic</b> ways, the way, what's the role of a document and what's the opportunity inside a computer to deal with documents? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>You can say, all right, one and the same, this is very much a model of what kind of currently is the primary thing to do with computers and documents is, you write, manipulate in computer storage and look at it and you've got page, pages and [inaudible 00:10:26] picture of what you see is what you're going to get because the objective is to print something out and deal with it. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>I just didn't for a minute stop there. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>This was never even in my picture, or, made it work for ten minutes and so on out. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>Here's more what the system in the '60s objective was. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>I'll go through these different things with some <b>slides</b> and demonstrations to kind of make them more real. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>The idea is that the tools and language and new methods for the human give you these new kinds of things and that you <b>want</b> open-ended vocabulary because the functionality is found and has evolved indefinitely, in my mind. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>If you've got a strong powerful beast in this computer doing for you what you <b>want</b> to get done you don't <b>want</b> to control it with very old-fashioned techniques like just a keyboard. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>It'd be like getting in a 300 horsepower high performance car and kicking up the range and saying, \"Get up.\" </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>It just isn't appropriate to keep hanging on there. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>What you <b>want</b> for a fast kind of control that the people <b>want</b> to get the real power out of that can evolve to. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>Then you <b>want</b> to do writing and structuring and both content and structure, the idea was to take the conceptual, symbolic structures that are in your mind and over here make a map of them that's the best representation you can that serves your purpose for what you'd like to do and are externally manipulable symbol record of what you're dealing with that represents your thoughts and concepts. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>Right away you can start thinking about putting structure in there that helps you work with relationships between your concepts. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>I just really began to say a hierarchy is a pretty good one, maybe I'd rather have reentrant lists and all of that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>We'll just start with simple hierarchy. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>In a couple years when we've learned a lot we'll move on to something else. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>Lot of evolutionary things didn't work as fast as I had assumed. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>Then the thing about the objects in your file <b>want</b> to be named and addressed because that gives you a lot more power for moving around in them. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>All that was built into here and it provides remote jumps and manipulation, it's very flexible and a strong focus on moving the positions in the file that you <b>want</b>ed to and when you get there you have a view generated for you that's what you need at the moment. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>The model of that sort of was you conceptually move your head to some topic. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>You also unconsciously <b>pick</b> a level of conceptualization on that topic. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>You probably don't go way down at the detail unless there's some very specific little piece of the assembly language code or something you <b>want</b> to deal with. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>Your mind just goes to a level. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>Why not give us the same capability in moving around there of having views that suit us at the moment? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>Which is strongly different from saying, \"I'm going to think of it as pages, and what you see is what you're going to get on paper and that's great.\" </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>No, here it says [inaudible 00:13:28] if you're going to print out, great. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>Then you'd like to see what you're going to get but while you're composing and studying and modifying and sharing you look at what, make it so that it benefits that and find your display that the human perceptual mechanism watches that and the motor mechanism controls all of these things to fly. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>That's the model that we built our systems and I'm going to probably demonstrate a bunch of those. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>First some <b>slides</b> to give us some idea about some of these two things. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>The open-ended vocabulary and the fast, concurrent control. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>We are very lucky to be part of the planning for the ARPANET from the very first time the idea of ARPANET was broached to the principle investigators of which I was one. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>In the original ideas we'd have a network, it would link just the, roughly thirteen computer systems, all of which were doing research for ARPA. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>No thought about linking to other people. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>In that sense, because it related so much what I <b>want</b>ed to do, I volunteered the day we were told about that to start and learn the network information centers. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>By the time we got it organized and got going the networks began to work in 1970, they began to add all kinds of other DOD users on there because they <b>want</b>ed the political support to help keep Congress from wiping out that network R and D program. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>Not realizing yet what a tremendously significant thing that network experiment turned out to be. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>Anyways, soon there were so many people on that network that the grand and glorious things I was going to do with support for small community just couldn't be supported for all of them. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>That was too bad. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>Anyway, one of the things we came out with was this feeling on the future about the arc<b>hit</b>ecture's going to look like this and this picture stems from early '70s. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>[inaudible 00:15:21] had that idea that whatever you had here for a workstation may couple with a network of networks and gateways and that anyone who is at a workstation, it isn't connected, it's like he's got an office without a door. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>I just could not imagine. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>What you <b>want</b> is an arc<b>hit</b>ecture that assumes you don't have homogeneous software and hardware out there because that's a terrible way, that's a sure way to kill evolution is to try to have a one-ended [inaudible 00:15:53] system, when you're talking about a sizable thing out there. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>If you've got application programming and data in your workstation, good. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>But whether it's out here in a local network or farther out in a private network or out in the public network your interface shouldn't be that worried about it. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>We actually built an independent user interface system work module that's been in there for twelve years now, that has a virtual terminal controller for the application program to kind of deal with a virtual terminal and there's a lot evolving nowadays that sort of fits that model. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>The command language interpreter that you can put a grammar attached to very quickly swapped this and it changes the whole nature of whatever interface language you <b>want</b> and it makes calls out to, remote procedure calls out to whatever back end you're working with. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>Procedure call interface there. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>User profile that makes the command recognition in whatever special things the user <b>want</b>s come in with that user and the terminal characteristics tell a virtual terminal controller how to deal with that kind of terminal. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>The idea is your actual terminal hardware, the keyboard and the things you actuate and see, is what you call a terminal, and if you've got lots of [inaudible 00:17:08] there let's put it out in the other side of what you think is a virtual bus. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>User interface systems sort of, interface in there and you can couple with things. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>An important part of what you're going to connect with is what you think of as your own, local work place that's just like your office. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>You have a place to sit down and you're thinking and working and mail interaction, preparing documents, things of that sort in your local workplace. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>The other things are sort of outside and the idea of reaching through to those in ways which has a compatible command language with what you're used to, so that's a translator in there for helping you interface with all those to something consistent. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>Each class of user with its class of terminals can sort of look into that workshop, knowledge workshop area, and extract a profile of functions and have that sort of conceptually oriented command language and command system that you like. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>We were building that and in the commercial world we got just into ten years ago, the customers didn't know what they <b>want</b>ed to have in this. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>They didn't <b>want</b> to pay for it, the people who are supporting us certainly weren't going to pay for it being done. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>Now in the big, heavy industrial world, just the kind of a thing they need to note a lot of movement potential thing to emerge. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>But within that thing that, heavy orientation about a document in this world is what is important right now to think about. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>That's still there. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>I worked through that list with you before and the notion we had very strongly was collaboration was a very important thing and one of them we <b>want</b>ed to be able to do right form the outset is share your screen with somebody at a distance so that you could actually call them up and collaborate. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>An arc<b>hit</b>ecture that's built in, too. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>We were going to give a demonstration of that today where I'd call up somebody and watch them turn on something and then go we'd see his screen and talk to him. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>It just go to be too much to

onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>But I'm going to start now on a little bit of thing about why does speed and flexibility pay off? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>I kept in the early '60s trying to say, \"Why? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>If you <b>delete</b> it, move it, change it right in front of you and get on with your things why it'd be worth absorbing a computer's attention?\" </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>One day I thought of this so I'd give people that brick and say begin to write. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>It's so clumsy and slow and fatiguing and you realize that it's just a matter of happenstance that the scale of our muscular and control systems and the tools we could build to write with let us write as adroitly as we can. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>What if it had been difficult relatively? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>It would have changed our whole culture and our whole way of thinking and our language [inaudible 00:20:14]. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>So I say all right, does that help you think about going the other way? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>All right. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>Anyway, the speed and flexibility which you can have your slate of tools do what you <b>want</b> them is an important aspect to the design. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>So I push this button and the slide doesn't advance. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>Among the things then, this is a picture of the very first mouse we made with, hand-carved, these two wheels right on the bare tabletop without any apology for not having a ball in between them and they worked beautifully for many years. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(5.82)'>We did a series of tests, we were

60s it became clear that there were two parts to deal with in that application package. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>One was the interaction with the user, and the other was the substantive work. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>I kept running into the problem, the programmers who did the substantive part of it thought that since they know what's going on inside, that they ought to decide on the interface. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>With much internal stress on our project, we said no. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>By 1968, we had actually separated and <b>started</b> evolving a second language by which you describe what that interface was going to be. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>Then this begins to evolve, and [you 00:19:20] says, \"Well, why not go on from there, to say why not one application independent user interface system that's just your

By 1968, [out of Hawaii 00:19:40] they were using a radio network that had the collision avoidance principles that the Ethernet had. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>It was very clear by the early 70s that the technology was going to keep evolving and this would be the general way in which organizations were equipped and working. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>What we wanted to do is say, \"Let's not get embroiled in the fights about, everything can go in the terminal since many computers or microcomputers are going to get cheaper and cheaper. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>Let's just talk about the connectedness we want, and let as the technology evolves, the different modules can move back and around in there, depending on the technological support of capacity in your workstation, and speed, and cost of inter-communications.\" </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>This was the kind of a picture then we get of saying, your terminal equipment is connected through this user interface system to a <b>virtual</b> bus that kind of start in your work station and go out as far as you want. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>Connect you with all of the different application packages, and that there'd be one special ...

[release 00:21:55] the evolution here from any particular terminal. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>We want to be sure that different users, classes of users, have a chance of evolving their <b>terminals</b> very easily. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>That provides for one kind of evolution, which was an important thing all the way through. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>How does you allow the organization's workshop to evolve? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>The next one is very important ... </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>Here I just give some examples of three more procedure calls that you can have various ... Oh no, this is a case where a <b>server</b> here serving you, in turn, is a client for a <b>server</b> here. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>A call can come through to this one, evokes one back to here, and that service is integrated into something in here that in turn serves this person. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>This model, to us, gave the option for, for instance, AI modules being put into the network in this way. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>In other words, the evolution could go on very flexibly if all the <b>server</b>s out into the network. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>The other one was that it would sense you could actually have different manufacturers and so on, user interface systems as long as they obeyed the same protocol in the same <b>virtual</b> terminal. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>These concepts of <b>virtual</b> <b>terminals</b> in this sense are fairly strongly embedded in what the McDonnell Douglas's integrated architecture pursuit. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>They're really going to try to go after that as much as they can. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>In a big organization, the time it takes to integrate all the different software packages is a huge, huge factor, [it outweighs 00:23:29] off from the cost of the service itself. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>This is the other very important thing for us in there, and ... that have a command language interpreter that watched and got every event the user did, and interpreted according to the grammar file, and the user's profile file to know what to do back in the interaction. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>Occasionally, pass something off here that got converted to a more procedure call and evoked the service that came out and supported the <b>virtual</b> terminal, etc. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>This gave us the flexibility for individual but at least classes of users to evolve their vocabulary, and the concept of an open ended vocabulary was just with us from the beginning. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>That grew out of our concepts, too. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>That you have to have it, that it can be open ended, and this is one of the things where, looking at the strong trends toward icon pictures, that the sense that it's going to run out of open ended field. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>We stuck with ... avoided ... </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>They had such things as menus and what you call \"light buttons\", the equivalent of icons, all were conceptually there in the '60s. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>My sort of simple-minded ergonomic look at it says \"No, they will run out of gas so we will use verbs and nouns, and then, whatever your user profile, this thing will allow you in the presentation of that and the recognition when the menus or icons [are at 00:25:02]. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>That's fine.\" </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>Then what's very important is to add a script interpreter into the command

</span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>It really starts freeing up the evolution of the vocabulary and the operations that go, so that part of evolutionary freedom was very, very important. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>Another extremely important thing that we began by the very early 70s to want to do shared screen work. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>I remember doing something, I guess it was probably 1972, with somebody from Rome, New York and I in Menlo Park. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>We're sharing the screen, working on a document together. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>The way by the time all this matured, it's done is a load

onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>It was very effective. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>Here's something that for years that seemed to me was bound to come about that sort of thing.

onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>Because to let that kind of sharing go on, and the executives that we keep worrying about having to learn too much. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>Say, \"Well, look, you can have staff that are trained that can be like your chauffeur, etc,\" and this is something to do. </span><br><br><span

onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>Let's jump back to the kind of concepts that in 62 were in that paper that I produced at that point. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>I was just

year by year by year. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>There's a great deal of value to pursue and we've just scratched the surface. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>As an engineer I finally said, \"Well, let's see. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>Where you're starting.?\" </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>Well, you're starting with humans and these are the basic capabilities in the knowledge work arena that I pictured humans having. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>You got mortal capabilities, you can grab, and reach, and turn, and twist, and actuate. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>You got sensory and perceptual machinery that lets you see, and understand, and perceive things. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>You got a lot of mental machinery that's got some [nice 00:30:09] and cognitive capabilities, and some of it is conscious and all. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>A bare human being just can't cope with outside world, so what's added? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>What's added is something I call an augmentation system, and these zones are what's added to the sort of naked-born human being. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>We all assume there's lots of teaching and learning that's going on, and a lot of unconscious conditioning that goes on to make you fit for the world. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>A lot of skills in your mortal and perceptual world that you, a lot of times aren't as clear about, but they're there. </span><br><br><span

onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>If you lump all those together and call it an augmentation system, that's what augments the basic human being, then the challenge is what can we do to keep on

onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>Well, our first step was trying to categorize a whole bunch of those augmentation system components. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>[Some 00:31:21] <b>pretty</b> soon I realize why it comes into some <b>pretty</b> simple parts. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>A very important thing for me was to say, well, let technology offer us a whole bunch of things that in a knowledge workshop, [from a 00:31:34] knowledge work are these kind of aspects your technology is providing. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>But there are all these other things that we sort of have taken for granted, but that the society builds and provides for us, and we have to develop skills and

onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>Well, next step is to say, \"Uh, almost any capability a human has, that he starts with here, is a composite of functional capability and support he gets from these, plus what he's learned [inside of 00:32:15] here.\" </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>It's all composite, and so with more thinking at such you say, \"Well, it's a very important system, how much gain can we have?\" </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>Well, the next step is to realize [while 00:32:27] that most of the capabilities you have, essentially all of them are built upon each other in a hierarchy. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(130.4)'>Then I did lots of thinking about this, and you get to realizing that hierarchy capabilities, the

onclick='player.seekTo(157.01)'>One thing, I'm talking about organizational change and evolution and that's been my pursuit for many years and what has happened quite recently that I'll just introduce a wave to you is the sort of emergence of a specific concept of really introducing higher quality into the organizational operations and start out with the products' mounts getting more expansive. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(182.04)'>Out in the commercial world, the Department of Commerce set up three years ago this plan for a National Quality Award. </span><br><br><span

strong move for this in the government. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(240.48)'>What I'm talking about now in general is a strategy that's been evolving with me for decades literally that was based upon the thing that organizations need to be a lot capable and here's the strategy for doing it, because it's very complex, etc. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(257.32)'>I'm going to walk you through some of the strategic concepts and a little bit of the specifics and in the end, sort of say well then, within organizations this is the way I would choose to, or suggest. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(274.39)'>Man machine. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(277.33)'>I would suggest the way in which we go after this pursuit. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(282.57)'>Let's start out with, first, how does thing crack? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(289.78)'>This is a statement that actually triggered me into all of this. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(296.38)'>It was 39 years ago, almost some time to the week or the month or something like that that this dawned on me. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(305.01)'>I was trying to pick someway to reorient my career because I'd realized that here I was in my mid-20s and I had a steady job and I was going to get married and all my goals were now taken care of and to have no more goals than that made me feel kind of embarrassed. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(320.21)'>Then what I did was overdid it about picking up a goal that's sort of been the bane of my life ever since. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(328.68)'>The realization that this is the kind of thing that was happening, even then. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(333.32)'>That all our problems seemed to be getting more complex and more and more they're getting urgent. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(340.54)'>It's increasingly difficult to cope with them as they get complex and in any degree of complexity it's increasingly difficult to cope if they get more urgent. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(348.35)'>The product of those two really means a measure of difficulty for coping and in 1951 I was saying, \"My golly, that's exceeded human capability to cope. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(360.13)'>If we can't cope, we're just sliding downhill faster and faster into more complex thing and we're going to crash sometime. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(365.87)'>Boy if I could do something about that.\" </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(368.09)'>I got this crazy picture about interacting with

something like that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(380.24)'>I'm sort of embarrassed by it. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(385.52)'>Anyway, that's what launched me. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(389.55)'>I had this driving picture about what could happen that seems to exceed what most people were thinking about what could happen. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(397.54)'>This is sort of one way to think about it for me. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(400.6)'>Compare human organization to a crude biological organism. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(404.34)'>The way our organizations are now. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(407.05)'>Slow responses, poor sight, lousy

onclick='player.seekTo(419.23)'>It's not the organization you work for, but it's some of the others that you've seen. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(424.8)'>All right. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(426.2)'>Then along in that world of slow evolution, etc, a slow mutation produces a new nervous system, technology if you will. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(436.34)'>Hugely better in all dimensions, sensing, remembering, associating, perceiving, reasoning, coordination. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(441.07)'>This is what's happened in our technological world. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(444.21)'>In the parallel you'd say, \"So that something biological happened and came up. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(448.29)'>So does that organism just replace its old nervous system, automate it and then that's where its future stays?\" </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(455.69)'>No. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(456.16)'>Out in evolution of organic things you know it takes off from there because it begins to find out it can start having new organs that can interrelate. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(464.81)'>With new functions and new specialties. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(466.77)'>It sets about evolving the rest of its organizational structure and function to become a new, different and much more capable organism. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(474.72)'>That's what just dawned on me, this intuitive picture. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(478.17)'>My God, we get organizations that get really reflexive, quick, aware. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(482.74)'>They are much more aware, can ingest what happens around them and digest it and make it part of their scene, of what's going on. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(489.98)'>If they pick goals, they're much better coordinated at picking up and moving after it and changing and moving. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(495.4)'>Knowing what's going on. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(496.35)'>Much more efficient utilization of all the component capabilities it has.

are many other reinforcing sort of concepts about what the future organizations can become. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(510.0)'>That's what sort of drove me in some strange way. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(513.96)'>An image of so much change. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(516.23)'>All right, if this technology can support that, how do you go about it? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(523.14)'>I just said, \"Well, we're going to augment the human.\" </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(526.24)'>The you have to have some sort of strategy. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(528.14)'>Let's start out by augmenting the intellectual work, I called it. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(532.33)'>By 1968 I read a book by Peter Drucker that talked about the emergence of the knowledge activity. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(538.74)'>Knowledge worker, knowledge work, knowledge organizations, knowledge industries. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(542.75)'>I said, \"Ah, that's a better term. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(545.63)'>Augmenting the knowledge work is a way to go after all of this.\" </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(550.11)'>That's not the whole solution, but that's a good way to do it because if you can augment, increase significantly the ability to do tough knowledge work, that's the component of effort that's going to be involved critically in trying to do the rest of your improvement of that organism. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(572.61)'>By the late 50s I realized, you really needed an appropriate way to think about this. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>Nowadays they would call it a paradigm, but that hadn't been popularized at that time. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>I found a beautiful article by some gooks at Rand who were doing in their multidisciplinary work they've really begin to find out that you formulate some new program and it takes multiple disciplines and you try to bring in people from the different disciplines and they look at it and says, \"I don't see the object of going that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>Our discipline's already doing that.\" </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>Or something of that sort. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>I was experiencing exactly that same thing. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>Information retrieval people would tell me, \"I don't see that you're talking about anything more than information retrieval, and we're already doing that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>Why are you off there waving this banner that's sounds so strange? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>Why don't you come here and do this hard work with us?\" </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>They really being very irritated with me about it. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>Emergent AI group like that too said, \"Well, we're doing that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>We're going to have these machines that are so smart that'll do that.\" </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>I said, \"No, I'm interested in boosting the human's capability. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>I'd be very happy for the human and an AI module to work as a team, so I would say the sort of augmented team is what I want instead of the artificial intelligence, as an end goal.\" </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>We didn't get along very well on that either, so I said, \"Well, I'll go off and make my own framework.\" </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>That framework isn't generally understood as an issue when you open new pursuits. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>When you grow up in any given discipline, you absorb in your professional training, a framework like that and that's how you view it. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>When the paradigms shifts hit the fan, as the saying goes, you're trying to make plans and pictures about this future environment and you're firmly embedded in the old paradigm. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>If years later you went back and see how you wrote, described what it is you want to do, in terms of the then acceptable framework, it'd be embarrassing the way you just sort of didn't see a lot of the whole picture. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>Of course, I don't want to get so personal because you're experience with it is always watching the other people that don't get it about what you're proposing to do. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>It finally dawned on me that I was guilty of that same thing and then to a great relief, I found that I could just say that's a human capability that everybody has. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>You find out that this kind of framework is embedded in your culture and a lot of it you just absorb unknowingly as you grow up and that that kind of cultural framework is one of the things that gives us enough inertia and stability so that we don't gyrate all over the place and change but it is- The basic problem is that in accommodating change is coping with that inertia culturally. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>Inappropriate framework may lead to wasteful mistrials, widely ignored possibilities. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>In this for instance, this computer supported cooperative work issue about computers could be useful for cooperative work. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>Now it's getting to be an exciting thing with conferences, et cetera. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>It could have emerged, that's what I was aiming at for many years. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>Why did it take so long? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>Some basic cultural perception of what computers were for and what you could do with them. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>Now we don't want to think that we suddenly get enlightened and that's going to be all over. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>That's going to be where this- any time the rate of change is above a certain rapidity, because there's a certain time constant to the adaptation culturally. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>As long as the rate of change stays up, we're always going to be floundering that way. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>Unless we find a way, instead of just depending on inheriting it, if we can start consciously cultivating that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>That's one of the real challenges because the rate of change in our whole culture and society is really, really going faster than we know how to cope. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>I'd better go faster too, huh? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>What I do, I <b>started</b> thinking like a nice little engineer about ... </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>In the next slide or so, a basic conceptual model that really takes a long time to describe, but I just said, \"Look. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>You're trying to do something with a human and human organizations, but how does a human deal with the outside world?\" </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>If you just take a bare human that's got some latent capability to develop perceptual skills and motor skills and sort of a mental machine there, some of who's activity you're conscious of, without training and everything, you're helpless. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>Societies had to develop a complex system of language, custom, tools, methods, so that the humans tiny grasp- All of this, the best they can do is grab something small or do a little bit of mental work. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>Very, very tiny little contributions. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>Somehow those tiny things could cope with large tasks and problems. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>It's in here. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>Your culture indoctrinates you to unconscious things, you learn a lot of conscious things you can do, the rest of it is out of control, of course. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>Then there are lots of things you've learned. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>Perceptual motor skills. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>Most of those things you all learned so that you can operate with a whole body of organizational and customs and artifacts in the outside world. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>These shaded areas, as they've developed, that's what augments that human so the human can cope. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>It's a very important thing and to me I realize, \"Oh. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>We ought to think of that as a system.\" </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>It's that system which has a chance now to be improved effectively and I assumed that some academic discipline would be dealing with such a whole system, but no. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>I called it an augmentation system and I dearly hope someday to see that that's, we start getting people who study that as a whole system who's architecture's very important. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>A little bit we'll show it. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>This was emerging about 1961 into something specific. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>It evolved to this and I don't have time to go into all the things that this does because this is sort of the fountainhead of all kinds of things that emerged and looking at it like that to say, \"All right, this whole bundle is what makes an individual or even it could portray for an organization, that you have these capabilities within the people and they have developed skills and knowledge through training in order to do that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>What are they skilled and knowledged about? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>Well, all of what the technology offers and for here I'm including here the things for the knowledge work domain and not for all the physical activities you do. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(573.64)'>None of that. </span><br><br><span

Engelbart<br>Bootstrap Project <br>Stanford University<br>1990 (AUGMENT,132082,)<br><br>Republished from Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, Los Angeles, CA, October 7-10, 1990, pp. 143-154.<br><br>INTRODUCTION<br><br>This paper anticipates that the tools and methods of computer-supported <b>cooperative</b> work (CSCW) will become harnessed with revolutionary benefit to the ongoing, everyday <b>knowledge</b> work within and between larger organizations. Toward that end, the following needs for <b>interoperability</b> between <b>knowledge</b>-work <b>domains</b> will have to be met, and something such as the \"open <b>hyperdocument</b> system\" must become available for widespread use.<br><br>As computers become cheaper and we learn more about harnessing them in our <b>cooperative</b> work, they will come to support an increasing number of different <b>domains</b> of <b>knowledge</b> work. Moreover, the sphere of computer-supported activity within each domain will steadily expand as more function and more skill become employed.<br><br>It is predictable that increasing functional overlap will occur as these expanding <b>domains</b> begin to overlap. It has become apparent to me that someday all of our basic <b>knowledge</b>-work <b>domains</b> will be integrated within one coherent \"organizational <b>knowledge</b> workshop.\" This leads to thinking about an over-all, integrated architectural approach to the ever larger set of common <b>knowledge</b> work capabilities emerging within a multi-vendor environment.<br><br>Much has been accomplished to date in standards and protocols in the highly active field of networked workstations & servers, where \"<b>interoperability</b> between hardware and/or software modules\" has become a central theme.<br><br>This paper considers the \"<b>interoperability</b> between <b>knowledge</b> <b>domains</b>.\" This <b>interoperability</b> theme will be increasingly important for a workable CSCW framework as the scope and degree of CSCW increases. Dramatic increases will predictably create a marked paradigm shift about how to organize and operate <b>cooperative</b> human endeavors. I think that two phenomena will yield changes and a paradigm shift that will make this <b>interoperability</b> of paramount importance:<br><br>with a relatively unbounded technological frontier together with immense and growing economic pressure, the speed, size and cost of computers, memory, and digital communications will continue improving by geometric progression;<br><br>awareness and importance of CSCW is emerging, with a predictable trend toward our doing more and more of our personal and <b>cooperative</b> <b>knowledge</b>-work online.<br><br>Assuming an inevitably gigantic scale for our inter-knit \"CSCW world\" provides some important guidance for the continuing investment of our business resources and professional time.<br><br>For one thing, each year earlier that an effective degree of <b>knowledge</b>-domain <b>interoperability</b> is in place within important organizational or institutional <b>domains</b> could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars -- could mean the difference between vitality and sluggishness.<br><br>And for another, we would prefer to avoid investing our research, product development, or organizational-change resources toward ends that won't be interoperably compatible within that future, radically different paradigm.<br><br><br>INTEROPERABILITY IN AN INDIVIDUAL'S KNOWLEDGE WORKSHOP<br><br>To begin with some very basic <b>knowledge</b>-domain <b>interoperability</b> issues, consider your own (future?) \"Computer-Supported Personal Work\" (CSPW). Assume that you have acquired a fairly comprehensive, online \"<b>knowledge</b> workshop,\" and that you have found better and better software packages to support the kinds of tasks shown in Figure 1:<br><br><br>ONE PERSON'S KNOWLEDGE WORKSHOP<br>Figure-1. Each functional domain is a candidate for working interchange with all others.<br><br>Consider what you will some day have when your individual workshop inevitably becomes truly integrated. Between the E-Mail and the task-management files, or the status reports, or whatever, you really would like to tie these functional <b>domains</b> together with a flexible free-flow of information and linkages.<br><br>What kind of <b>interoperability</b> do you have now? I happen to think that the <b>interoperability</b> provided today within most CSPW <b>domains</b> has a great deal of improvement yet to be pursued. But I'd resist any serious argument about this unless it be approached within the context of a coherent \"CSCW <b>interoperability</b> framework\" such as outlined below. Let me say in warning, though, that from such a framework I will contend that the marketplace for CSPW will change drastically as CSCW takes hold within our larger organizations and their inter-organizational communities.<br><br><br></div><div id='full_2'><mark>INTEROPERABILITY IN A GROUP'S KNOWLEDGE WORKSHOP<br><br>Suppose that you and a colleague each have a fully integrated CSPW domain, comprised of nicely interoperable sub-<b>domains</b> as in Figure 1.</mark></div><div> And suppose that you want to work together online. Consider the <b>interoperability</b> between your respective <b>knowledge</b>-work <b>domains</b>, as in Figure 2.<br><br><br>KNOWLEDGE DOMAIN A / KNOWLEDGE DOMAIN B<br>Figure-2. Close cooperation between compound <b>knowledge</b> <b>domains</b> puts new demands on <b>knowledge</b>-work interchange.<br><br>Now you're faced with a new challenge and a new problem. You might set it up so you have a few lines that cross between <b>domains</b>, but why stop there? When do two people in intense <b>cooperative</b> work NOT need total <b>interoperability</b>? In fact they depend on it heavily in the paper world. Why not online?<br><br><br>INTEROPERABILITY ACROSS TIME AND SPACE<br><br>Yet another example of multiple <b>domains</b> is found in the familiar time-place <b>matrix</b> shown in Figure 3. In many cases, activities in the different quadrants involve the same substantive work content. Is <b>knowledge</b>-work <b>interoperability</b> between the quadrant <b>domains</b> an issue? Very much so. For example, face-to-face meetings need to flexibly utilize anything from the whole organizational <b>knowledge</b> base, and the meeting's records should immediately become an integral part of that same base for later-time work.<br><br>(quadrant showing Different/Same Time/Place<br>Figure-3. Collaborative processes generally considered within four separate <b>domains</b>.<br><br><br>A POINT ABOUT ONLINE GROUP KNOWLEDGE WORK <br><br>The <b>matrix</b> in Figure 3 is very neat and ordered. Here in Figure 4 I offer another picture of multi-domain, group <b>knowledge</b> work which isn't so cleanly laid-out. This reflects how I feel about the various <b>knowledge</b>-work <b>domains</b> with which my CSPW domain must interoperate.<br><br>(what the grid looks like in actual practice, not neat quadrant of separate activities, but all over the map<br>Figure-4. Consider some <b>knowledge</b> <b>domains</b> with which you intersect significantly.<br>5a1<br>The purpose of <b>interoperability</b> is to avoid having information islands between which information cannot flow effectively. Since we grew up in a paper-based framework, we've given little thought about how much <b>exchange</b> and <b>interoperability</b> support we really do have, and how much we depend upon it. To be interoperable in our CSPW world we could simply print out and hand over the hard copy. With WYSIWYG screens and Desktop Publishing, we're doing that with nicer paper, faster.<br><br>As we inevitably move from computer-supported paper generation and <b>exchange</b> to computer-supported online creation and <b>exchange</b>, we will need the same level of <b>interoperability</b>. And as the number and scale of <b>knowledge</b> <b>domains</b> involved in a given CSCW \"web\" increases, so does the need for \"online <b>interoperability</b>.\"<br><br><br></div><div id='full_4'><mark>INTEROPERABILITY ACROSS KNOWLEDGE DOMAINS <br><br>To appreciate the extraordinary complexity of heavy industrial <b>knowledge</b> work, and the associated requirements for <b>interoperability</b>, consider the important functional <b>domains</b> within a large manufacturing organization producing a complex product, such as an airplane.</mark></div><div> It is a serious enough challenge to provide effective <b>interoperability</b> among the <b>knowledge</b> workers within any one of the <b>domains</b> in Figure 5; just consider the inter-domain challenge. And then consider that some of these <b>domains</b>, such as customers and <b>suppliers</b>, exist \"outside\" the organization, each with its own equally complex multi-domain structure.<br><br><br>MANUFACTURING ORGANIZATION<br>Figure-5. Each functional domain is a candidate for working interchange with all others.<br><br>THE LARGE MATRIX ORGANIZATION<br><br>An interesting example comes from my time at McDonnell Douglas Corporation, where I marvelled at how something as complex as one of their airplanes gets a business plan, and gets designed, manufactured, flown, and supported. Look at any given project or program (\"P1\" through \"Pn\" in Figure 6), and the functional support that's required (\"F1\" through \"Fn\"), and the <b>exchange</b> that needs to happen within this <b>matrix</b>.<br><br>(grid showing intersecting <b>knowledge</b> <b>domains</b><br>Figure-6. Consider the <b>domains</b> within a <b>matrix</b> organization of projects and functions.<br><br>Each function has to share and <b>exchange</b> working information with many programs, and each program has to share and <b>exchange</b> with many functional support areas. Wherever there isn't mutual <b>interoperability</b>, the workers at the domain intersections will have to suffer with inter-domain switching and converting -- which is very expensive. Depending upon this kind of functional program <b>matrix</b> will require <b>knowledge</b>-domain <b>interoperability</b> across the whole organization.<br><br>THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY AS A CASE IN POINT<br><br>To really appreciate the magnitude of this situation, let's look inside one of those <b>aerospace</b> programs.<br><br>A Large Aerospace Program. McDonnell Aircraft Company is participating in a bid to build the Advanced Tactical Fighter (\"ATF\") for the Air Force. It's possibly one of the most technically complex products anyone has ever dealt with.<br><br>On top of that, they have an urgent mandate to start practicing \"concurrent engineering,\" where the designers have to work concurrently with the manufacturing engineers. This will require intense back-and-forth cooperation between the two <b>knowledge</b> <b>domains</b>, which no one really knows yet how to do on such a large scale.<br><br>Also, significant design and manufacturing problems are often delegated to the first-tier <b>suppliers</b> shown in Figure 7, so the cooperation with that tier is also close and intense. Then the first tiers hand off to the second tiers, and so on. So, all-in-all, you have something like 6,000 companies cooperating -- each a separate, complex, <b>knowledge</b>-work domain. They are expected to keep track of all business- and technical-<b>exchange</b> records throughout the design and manufacturing process:<br><br>(supplier pyramid with McDonnell Aircraft program at the top 2000-3000 people, interacting with  multiple tiers of <b>suppliers</b> below, each interacting with the other<br>Figure-7. Islands in supplier hierarchy of a major aircraft program would be very costly.<br><br>I should point out here that the arrows in the diagram represent the legal flow of contracts being awarded. The actual <b>exchange</b> of documents would be shown as a two-way flow of continual negotiation and refinement throughout the design and manufacturing process -- developing specifications, proposals, change orders, testing records, and so on. And for any part within any airplane, the manufacturer must later be able to identify when it was delivered, by whom, and even who was the shop foreman at the time of assembly.<br><br>Also, a program of this size in the <b>aerospace</b> world would typically comprise a 10 to 30 year life cycle. So when we talk of Different Time / Same Place, and Different Time / Different Place (Figure 3), the definition of \"Time\" includes decades, not just hours or days. Even in a short time span and without turnover, it is not unheard of for a project team, in any industry, to occasionally lose sight of some important design decision trails, and consequently waste time and money repeating old discussions or past mistakes. Consider the likelihood, and the cost, of such lost history occuring in this long-term environment.<br><br>To comply with the Department of Defense's (DoD's) forthcoming Computer-aided Acquisition and Logistic Support (CALS) mandate, all documents <b>exchange</b>d between the DoD and its contractors must be transmitted, updated, and managed in a standard, computerized form -- a truly gigantic <b>interoperability</b> challenge.<br><br>Two Companies Teaming. The situation is even more complex: as with most new, large-system, DoD procurements, the Air Force requires ATF bidders to be joint-venture teams comprised of major <b>aerospace</b> firms. In this case, McDonnell Aircraft is teaming with Northrop Aircraft. Figure 8 shows how Northrop would form its part of the program, with several thousand workers internally, in close collaboration with several tiers of <b>suppliers</b>:<br><br>(same as Figure-7 but with Northrop Aircraft as the lead company)<br>Figure-8. Islands in supplier hierarchy of a major aircraft program would be very costly.<br>8h1<br>And then picture the two companies as a team (Figure 9), and consider the intense demands for interoperable recorded document <b>exchange</b> across functional support and project <b>domains</b> within this ATF-contractor team -- within each company, between the two companies, and between them and the DoD (remembering the CALS initiative).<br><br>TWO AEROSPACE COMANIES REQUIRED TO DO 'PROGRAM TEAMING' (shows two interacting knowedge networks)<br>Figure-9. Close cooperation between large organizations puts new demands on <b>knowledge</b>-work interchange.<br>And then consider Figure 10 and all of the recorded interchange between these two companies and their supplier hierarchies, throughout the multi-decade life cycle of the program.<br><br>(shows the two supplier hierarchy pyramids having to interact at all levels in the supply chain)<br>Figure-10. Close cooperation between large organizations puts new demands on <b>knowledge</b>-work interchange.<br><br>The Web Of Aerospace Relationships. Now consider all the other large-program webs of <b>aerospace</b> contractors, <b>suppliers</b>, and customers represented by the small sub-set shown in Figure 11. A great many of these <b>suppliers</b> and customers will work with many of the same contractors. The complexity becomes staggering. Within such an inter-knit web of <b>cooperative</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>domains</b>, there is no practical solution for effective <b>interoperability</b> other than industry-wide standards -- adhered to by contractors, customers, and <b>suppliers</b>.<br><br>(shows multiple supplier hierarchies now including Boeing, Lockheed, and all their customer organizations)<br>Figure-11. With common customers and <b>suppliers</b>, an <b>aerospace</b> industry can't afford islands.<br><br>And every other large industrial sector must also achieve CSCW <b>interoperability</b>. And those sectors must themselves interact effectively. The CSCW-interoperable web will cover the world, as has clearly been or will be done for transportation and communications (e.g. telegraph, telephone, radio, or TV). I think a strong case can be made that the cost of NOT having total <b>knowledge</b>-domain <b>interoperability</b> would far exceed the cost of achieving this <b>interoperability</b>.<br><br>So how will this urgent need be satisfied -- for intense, computer-supported cooperation across the <b>knowledge</b> <b>domains</b> of our rapidly approaching future world? It would seem that our \"CSCW future\" must include something like the solution characterized below as \"an open <b>hyperdocument</b> system.\" And if so, then all of our research, product development and application exploration should align with and properly affect the concepts and principles by which this future state is pursued.<br><br><br>TOWARDS AN OPEN HYPERDOCUMENT SYSTEM<br><br>Several years ago at McDonnell Douglas Corporation we coined the term \"Open Hyperdocument System\" (OHS) and began to define the associated functional and <b>interoperability</b> requirements for the kind of wide-area online <b>cooperative</b> <b>knowledge</b> work described above. This followed several years of careful study, and some pilot trials -- one of which involved thousands of <b>knowledge</b>-workers using a prototype system containing many of the required capabilities.<br><br>Note: McDonnell Douglas is poised to move forward with requirements such as below as the basis for functional specifications and a workable procurement process.<br><br>In the following, I assume a need to provide basic capabilities so generic as to satisfy both the CSPW and CSCW application requirements over a broad spectrum of <b>knowledge</b> <b>domains</b> within a wide variety of organizations -- including for instance universities, standards groups, and the U.S. Congress.<br><br><br>SOME GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS<br><br>In an open <b>hyperdocument</b> system, basic standards for document architecture are of course important. But beyond that, facilities for creating, transporting, storing, accessing and manipulating the <b>hyperdocument</b>s are embedded within an open, interoperable information-system environment, and the combined functionality is available within the <b>knowledge</b>-work <b>domains</b> of every class of worker (working from any vendor's terminal/workstation of suitable capability). Under these conditions, the role and value of <b>hyperdocument</b>s within groups, and between groups, offers very significant improvements in productive <b>knowledge</b> work.<br><br>Two unique issues differentiate this new environment from document-support systems to date: (1) interlinking between objects arbitrarily located within a large, multi-topic and extended-history document & data collection; and (2) extensive, concurrent, online utilization for creating, studying, organizing and linking within and between the many overlapping and nested <b>knowledge</b> <b>domains</b>.<br><br>These differences introduce paradigm shifts that produce different system requirements from those that have been evolving in the predominantly CSPW marketplace. For instance, WYSIWYG will give way to WYSIWYN -- \"what you see is what you need (at the moment)\" -- providing different options for how you'd view selected portions of the document space in your windows. The WYSIWYG view would be but one option (and likely to be utilized with decreasing frequency). Other expected shifts are implicit in some of the following suggested OHS requirements.<br><br>Besides special, \"document-system architecture\" features, full achievement of large-domain CSCW gains awaits two things:<br><br>widespread implementation of integrated, open-system architectures for the underlying hardware and software structures; and<br>widespread adoption of new <b>knowledge</b>-work processes (or, \"<b>knowledge</b> processes\").<br><br>To me, these new <b>knowledge</b> processes are especially relevant. They will involve new systems of skills, conventions, roles, procedures, methods and even organizational structures. I believe that they will provide a much more effective matching of basic human capabilities to the heavy <b>knowledge</b>-work and collaborative tasks within the functional human groupings that we call \"organizations,\" and within the mission-specific groupings that we call \"projects.\"<br><br>In my experience, truly effective new <b>knowledge</b> processes will emerge only via a co-evolutionary process -- new <b>knowledge</b> processes and the new tools evolving together in real working environments. Explicit evolutionary pursuit with numerous, well-run pilot groups, seems called for.<br><br>From this is derived the position that a really good set of requirements and functional specifications for an OHS can only emerge from solid prototypical experience, in which advanced <b>knowledge</b> processes were developed and exercised along with advanced tools.<br><br>Note that the following list was derived from extensive experience with the evolution of the AUGMENT System (an OHS prototype owned by McDonnell Douglas) and its concurrent application within numerous real-work pilots.<br><br><br>ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF AN OHS<br><br>Mixed-Object Documents -- to provide for an arbitrary mix of text, diagrams, equations, tables, raster-scan images (single frames, or even live video), spread sheets, recorded sound, etc -- all bundled within a common \"envelope\" to be stored, transmitted, read (played) and printed as a coherent entity called a \"document.\"<br><br>Explicitly Structured Documents -- where the objects comprising a document are arranged in an explicit hierarchical structure, and compound-object substructures may be explicitly addressed for access or manipulation of the structural relationships.<br><br>View Control of Objects' Form, Sequence and Content -- where a structured, mixed-object document may be displayed in a window according to a flexible choice of viewing options -- especially by selective level clipping (outline for viewing), but also by filtering on content, by truncation or some algorithmic view that provides a more useful view of structure and/or object content (including new sequences or groupings of objects that actually reside in other documents). Editing on structure or object content from such special views would be allowed whenever appropriate.<br><br>The Basic \"Hyperdocument\" -- where embedded objects called \"links\" can point to any arbitrary object within the document, or within another document in a specified domain of documents -- and the link can be actuated by a user or an automatic process to \"go see what is at the other end,\" or \"bring the other-end object to this location,\" or \"execute the process identified at the other end.\" (These executable processes may control peripheral devices such as CD ROM, video-disk players, etc.)<br><br></div><div id='full_3'><mark>Hyperdocument \"Back-Link\" Capability -- when reading a <b>hyperdocument</b> online, a worker can can utilize information about links from other objects within this or other <b>hyperdocument</b>s that point to this <b>hyperdocument</b> -- or to designated objects or passages of interest in this <b>hyperdocument</b>.</mark></div><div><br><br>The Hyperdocuments \"Library System\" -- where <b>hyperdocument</b>s can be submitted to a library-like service that catalogs them and guarantees access when referenced by its catalog number, or \"jumped to\" with an appropriate link. Links within newly submitted <b>hyperdocument</b>s can cite any passages within any of the prior documents, and the back-link service lets the online reader of a document detect and \"go examine\" any passage of a subsequent document that has a link citing that passage.<br><br>Hyperdocument Mail -- where an integrated, general-purpose mail service enables a <b>hyperdocument</b> of any size to be mailed. Any embedded links are also faithfully transmitted -- and any recipient can then follow those links to their designated targets in other mail items, in common-access files, or in \"library\" items.<br><br>Personal Signature Encryption -- where a user can affix his personal signature to a document, or a specified segment within the document, using a private signature key. Users can verify that the signature is authentic and that no bit of the signed document or document segment has been altered since it was signed.<br><br>Access Control -- Hyperdocuments in personal, group, and library files can have access restrictions down to the object level.<br><br>Link Addresses That Are Readable and Interpretable By Humans -- one of the \"viewing options\" for displaying/printing a link object should provide a human-readable description of the \"address path\" leading to the cited object; AND, that the human must be able to read the path description, interpret it, and follow it (find the destination \"by hand\" so to speak).<br><br>Every Object Addressable -- in principle, every object that someone might validly want/need to cite should have an unambiguous address (capable of being portrayed in a manner as to be human readable and interpretable). (E.g., not acceptable to be unable to link to an object within a \"frame\" or \"card.\")<br><br>Hard-Copy Print Options to Show Addresses of Objects and Address Specification of Links -- so that, besides online workers being able to follow a link-citation path (manually, or via an automatic link jump), people working with associated hard copy can read and interpret the link-citation, and follow the indicated path to the cited object in the designated hard-copy document.<br><br>Also, suppose that a hard-copy worker wants to have a link to a given object established in the online file. By visual inspection of the hard copy, he should be able to determine a valid address path to that object and for instance hand-write an appropriate link specification for later online entry, or dictate it over a phone to a colleague.<br><br>HYPERDOCUMENTS IN A GENERAL INTEGRATED ARCHITECTURE<br><br>Besides the aforementioned Hyperdocument Mail and Hyperdocument Library features, there are other important CSCW features that are dependent upon an \"integrated system\".<br><br>Shared-Window Teleconferencing -- where remote distributed workers can each execute a related support service that provides the \"viewing\" workers with a complete dynamic image of the \"showing\" worker's window(s). Used in conjunction with a phone call (or conference call), the parties can work as if they are sitting side-by-side, to review, draft, or modify a document, provide coaching or consulting, and so on. Control of the application program (residing in the \"showing\" worker's environment) can be passed around freely among the participants.<br><br>Inter-Linkage Between Hyperdocuments and Other Data Systems -- for instance, a CAD system's data base can have links from annotations/comments associated with a design object that point to relevant specifications, requirements, arguments, etc. of relevance in a <b>hyperdocument</b> data base -- and the back-link service would show <b>hyperdocument</b> readers which passages were cited from the CAD data base (or specified parts thereof).<br><br>Similarly, links in the <b>hyperdocument</b>s may point to objects within the CAD bases. And, during later study of some object within the CAD model, the back-link service could inform the CAD worker as to which <b>hyperdocument</b> passages cited that object.<br><br>External-Document Control (XDOC) -- Same \"catalog system\" as for <b>hyperdocument</b> libraries -- with back-link service to indicate links from <b>hyperdocument</b> (and other) data bases, for any relevant material that resides offline or otherwise external to the OHS.<br><br><br></div><div id='full_1'><mark>THE INTEROPERABLE OHS ENVIRONMENT<br><br>Here's what the share-and-<b>exchange</b> domain within an open <b>hyperdocument</b> system might look like:<br><br>(shows a standard <b>knowledge</b> infrastructure supporting 'Throw-Away Mail', shared files, a 'Journal' of permanently recorded documents, and an 'XDOC'  collection of any accumulated hardcopy documentation or tidbits -- such that any given item in any given <b>knowledge</b> domain can be shared across organizational and software boundaries while the hotlinks and other embedded attributes of the file retain their integrity and inter-operability)<br>Figure-12.</mark></div><div> Interoperable <b>knowledge</b> <b>domains</b> share and <b>exchange</b> documents.<br><br>The requirements outlined above form a basic support platform for any group <b>knowledge</b> work effort, with <b>interoperability</b> across time and space (including all quadrants of the Time / Place <b>matrix</b>), across <b>knowledge</b> <b>domains</b>, and across organizational <b>domains</b>.<br><br><br>THE INTEROPERABILITY INVESTMENT<br><br>It could take a lot of effort and expense to get such <b>knowledge</b>-work <b>interoperability</b>.

You'd compare the value of A vs. B, or B vs. C. And you'd say, \"Well, let's see, with each successive choice I'd save more money, wouldn't I?\" So how much more? We don't know how to quantify it yet. But, once you start finding a way to make some of the major sub-<b>domains</b> interoperable, by the time you've picked these selective lines in Choice A or B, what would be the incremental cost in dollars and effort to get Choice C?<br><br>But the real question is, what does it cost in dollars and effort NOT to have the <b>interoperability</b>.<br><br><br>THE OHS MOVEMENT<br><br>I asked people familiar with complex <b>aerospace</b> projects, \"Well all right, let's make a guess -- if the kind of <b>hyperdocument</b> <b>interoperability</b> we are talking about here were installed for instance under the whole design & manufacturing operation of this ATF program, what might the yearly dollar benefit be?\" They look back and forth at each other for a while ... So I offer: \"$300,000,000 a year?\" And they look at it and say, \"At least.\"<br><br>User organizations must realize that they can't just sit back and wait for the standards groups and computer vendors to deliver this, because there hasn't yet been enough orientation or application experience in this area. It seems necessary for the larger user organizations to take responsibility, to become pro-active -- e.g., with exploratory pilots, active development of associated <b>knowledge</b> processes, and <b>cooperative</b> requirements definition -- and then show the vendors that there is a sizable market for this.<br><br>But they must also realize that it isn't just a matter of specifying, procuring, and installing the resulting system -- they have to learn how to employ it effectively in this extremely complex environment. And they must realize that they have to cooperate more intensively than before: The stakes are extremely large; there is too much to learn and events are moving too rapidly; the resources and degree of stakeholder coordination involved are both very high.<br><br>To find this effort emerging from within the <b>aerospace</b> industry seems likely enough to me: it is the most complex work environment I know of, and a most urgent candidate for harnessing the benefits of wide-area CSCW and effective <b>knowledge</b>-domain <b>interoperability</b>. But other large organizations also have pressing needs for exactly this same capability -- for example, car manufacturers, computer vendors, government agencies, consulting firms, universities, consortia, and standards groups.<br><br>To me there is a real need for a <b>cooperative</b> movement -- among large organizations that are heavily dependent on group <b>knowledge</b> work -- to coordinate planning and operation of advanced, cost-effective pilot explorations in this area and to share the experiences and results. This relates to what I am currently doing at Stanford University with the Bootstrap Project: exploring with a number of larger organizations how a \"<b>cooperative</b>, CSCW community\" could be set up and run to provide both valuable pilot-application experience and substantive <b>knowledge</b> products.<br><br>One of the first projects of this community would be to collaborate on the requirements for an open <b>hyperdocument</b> system, and on a procurement approach. The community would employ a prototype OHS platform (initially AUGMENT from McDonnell Douglas) to collaborate on this and other related projects. This hands-on experience will be an important part of the exercise, and should provide valuable insight into how to employ these capabilities effectively. Similar pilot trials will be launched within member organizations.<br><br><br>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:<br><br>This work was sponsored by grants from the Kapor Family Foundation, Sun Microsystems, Inc., and Apple Computer, Inc.<br></div>",

it. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(359.98)'>Well it says, if you're going to do that, halt any activity that's improving the augmentation or the capability of doing the A work.

there, again it's a very dramatic thing that people don't talk about that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(359.98)'>I had to start thinking like this in order to try to say, why was I

onclick='player.seekTo(359.98)'>It turns out that it really starts to get some collaborative things. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(359.98)'>That's where 30 years ago, the business about

out saying; we're going to go after CoDIAK very heavily. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(359.98)'>To do that I'm going to push as far ahead and as fast I can in the technology that will advance it. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(359.98)'>There are practical things about how you make big advances like moving from a tricycle to a bicycle. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(359.98)'>You don't do it by a whole bunch of people. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(359.98)'>You're trying to encourage to make it once, you got to do it by small

too. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(359.98)'>You want a 2-way flow, technology transfer, lots or lessons learned and objects et cetera. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(359.98)'>The model for how this community can work is a model for all kinds of projects collaborating projects going inside. </span><br><br><span

that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(359.98)'>I'm just so convinced that augmentation, the whole system approach is someday going to produce really extraordinary capabilities in organizations. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(359.98)'>I'm so convinced that the world needs it immensely that I absolutely cannot retire or sit down until this bootstrapping gets a start. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(359.98)'>Because I really feel that's a strategy that could a difference. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(359.98)'>This pledge I made 40

onclick='player.seekTo(359.98)'>Because how could I finish this if I die of cancer? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(359.98)'>One of the interesting things, it could almost seem like an

onclick='player.seekTo(359.98)'>It seems like it's a very novel community as it stands now in order to take on some of these things, the organizations. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(359.98)'>It'd be interesting to work more with you. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(359.98)'>The world needs dialogue and I need people to interact with because

I went down and enrolled in electrical engineering and one of the reasons was I had heard about an exciting new technology in the military called RADAR and somehow there was a training you could go through to learn about RADAR and didn't particularly have aspirations for any other military <b>career</b> so I figured I'd get ready for it by taking electrical engineering. I didn't have any <b>career</b> plans, but that was just coming out of the depression and my father had been dead since I was nine. So there wasn't much to orient me about a <b>career</b>, but I was interested in getting an education.<br><br><br><br>RADAR and the Navy<br><br>JE: So you did electrical engineering for a couple years and then went to the Navy, is that right?<br><br>DE: By the end of my sophomore year, if you were in college in engineering you were getting deferred. But, they dropped all that and so I got drafted at the end of my sophomore year, and when you get drafted you can opt for different choices. So, I took a test that the Navy was giving for the RADAR, trying to screen <b>people</b> to go into this new technology. So, as an enlisted man I got to get drafted into the navy and go into their year long training program.<br><br>JE: So, your plan sort of worked, you did get yourself ready for RADAR. Now you were in RADAR for a couple years, or?<br><br>DE: Well you trained as an electronic technician, which means that you took care of Radios, SONAR, teletype transmission, and RADAR. So that, you were responsible for maintaining their equipment. So it was just one of the enlisted men's ratings.<br><br>JE: So, you probably got hands on that you wouldn't have gotten in engineering.<br><br>DE: It was just a good training altogether being responsible for, as a technician for maintaining things. For whatever background I've had it was a good introduction into a lot of aspects of technology, wave propagation, antennas, amplifiers all kinds of things. I was sent over to the Philippines and the interesting thing about that is, we were loaded onto the ship in San Francisco Harbor and going to be sent out there to help replace, one of the places in the war that Navy's were taking a lot of casualties was the kami-kazi's were hitting right under the bridge and that was happening to communication centers so, if you were one of the technicians working in there you were wounded. But, anyway's the ship backed out of it's berth and <b>started</b> around San Francisco and we were all up on deck watching things, it was a converted freighter. A bunch of whistles <b>started</b> going off and firecrackers going off and we thought everyone was cheering and we were thinking \"Do they do this for every ship going away\". Then the captain says \"Japan just surrendered.\"<br><br>JE: Perfect timing.<br><br>DE: Oh boy. So we all <b>started</b> shouting \"Turn around, turn around!\"<br><br>JE: So, you still had to go to the Philippines anyway?<br><br>DE: Yeah, there was still a lot of stuff to take care of things needed to be demobilized, and y'know.<br><br><br><br>NACA<br><br>JE: Interesting. So then you got out of the Navy, and that was around <b>nineteen</b> forty-six.<br><br>DE: Yeah, it was the summer of forty-six so I went right back to Coravallis to join the thousands of other serviceman, G.I.'s and by forty-eight finished...<br><br>JE: So, you went back to Coravallis and finished up your degree in electrical engineering.<br><br>DE: Spring, of forty-eight and for some reason took a job with the NACA at Haines Laboratory Mountain View, California down in the San Francisco area.<br><br>JE: What were they doing?<br><br>DE: Well the NACA is the National Aeronautic Commission or something, it was the forerunner of NASA so that became a NASA laboratory. So it's wind tunnels and aeronautic research that was going on. So I was hired as an electrical engineer to work and help make them. So I was working with motors, twenty-five thousand horsepower motors, and all kinds of things.<br><br><br><br>New Ideas for Computers<br><br>JE: That could be fun. But, at some point you discovered the job over at Stanford, is that what happened?<br><br>DE: Well what happened was I had been there for two-and-a-half years and in December of fifty I got engaged and that somehow, up till then I was assuming I would just work there, but that just kind of shook me out of some kind of orientation, something made me try to look at what my <b>career</b> was and I realized that I didn't have any more goals and a steady job and getting married and living happily ever after. So, as I explained on the video I overacted and worked over the next three, or four months to see what could a <b>career</b> goal be and by February or March, somewhere in there, I committed to, by saying \"I'm going to commit my <b>career</b> to trying to make it\" let's see \"see how I can maximize my <b>career</b>s contribution to improving mankind's capability for dealing with complexity and urgency.\" Somehow I said the world's getting so complex and everything happening was urgent and our ability to cope with that is not increasing as fast as complexity ad urgency is and that can only spell a higher and higher probability of global disaster if we don't do something and then let me see what I can do. Then I got the image of the way computers could help interactively and the RADAR technician training let me realize easily that a computer could make anything happen on a display screen and engineering anything you do...<br><br>JE: Had you worked with computers on any of these jobs?<br><br>DE: Oh, no. The nearest working computer was probably in Baltimore. I just read a book, that's how I got this image and I said \"Okay, I commit.\" and that has been the commitment ever since. So what I did then was look for a way to get into that field and at Berkeley they had an O and R project to build a general purpose digital computer and it had been going on for three years or so. Then I went up and entered graduate school there and <b>started</b> learning what there was to know about computers. It wasn't until <b>nineteen</b> fifty-three, I think, when I saw my first working computer.<br><br>JE: Was that in the west or did you go east for that?<br><br>DE: No, it was at UCLA. The bureau of standards was building computers, so they had...<br><br>JE: SWY (?sp?)<br><br>DE: Yeah, SWY, Williams two number. Mainframe time to failure, about fifteen minutes, two hundred and fifty words, or something, memory and everyone was so excited. So, can you imagine somebody talking about interactive computer use at that point, y'know, it sounds very unreal.<br><br>JE: But, you had a sense of what could happen.<br><br>DE: Yeah, I just thought \"Well, it could do that\" and it was clear by then the interest in computers both commercially and military was very, very high so that you knew there would be a lot of development. So, I said \"All right. That looks to me like the best way I could pursue that commitment I made.\" But the strange thing, I finally got my Ph.D. and was teaching.<br><br><br><br>SRI<br><br>JE: At Berkeley?<br><br>DE: Yeah, and <b>people</b> kept saying, \"If you keep talking about this kind of professional, no one's doing that, your peers won't except it, there's no place to publish it. You'll be an acting assistant professor for ever.\" So, that's when I decided to go to SRI and in between I tried starting my own company, for about a year. Some of the patents that came out of my Ph.D work... a string of maybe fifteen and I thought that I could get into a business, and if I could make a bunch of money off that then I could do my augmenting. But, by the end of the year I realized that a: semiconductor technology was going to bypass what I'd gotten. I was doing plasma, gas plasma things, so semiconductor plasmas were a lot better. So, I dumped that and applied to SRI thinking if any place in the world could, y'know, I could sell any management someplace about trying to explore this augmenting thing. So, I had to sort of subjugate my interest and go there and start working for a new board and having those patents was such help for keeping SRI. Pretty soon I <b>started</b> generating more patents in what they were working on, magnetic components, and built up sort of enough credibility.<br><br>JE: Was this memory, or was this...?<br><br>DE: No... a fellow named Hue Krane conceived of ways to cores that had multiple apatures instead of just one, that this very interesting way with a continuing series of driving pulses you could actually store states in them and propagate it down shift registers. It actually had gain and energy so that you had stable plus' and minuses and you could store and move things. I worked in that area for a while then just very about what I really wanted to do. So, finally got a little bit of part-time support for starting to think clearly about this augmenting thing.<br><br><br><br>Augmenting Human Intellect<br><br>JE: So during this period you were trying to sell some of the management at, or whatever level, or your colleagues at Stanford.<br><br>DE: SRI could spend some of their internal R and D money they kind of gave themselves , then I got some money from a small airforce office for scientific research in Washington, and there was enough there along with SRI's contribution I could work full time for a couple years and produce what I called, something entitled Augmenting Human Intelectic Conceptual Framework. I sent David, did you see that?<br><br>JE: Oh yes. I certainly did see that.<br><br>DE: Well, the second thing in there was the report I published on that.<br><br>JE: We're going to be looking at that for a long time, there is a lot of stuff in there.<br><br>DE: That <b>sixty</b>-two report, I wasn't given enough time to put it together to see what it was and so I was really pitching to try to get support to do that and was applying quite a few places and one of the interesting anecdotes about that is, one of the places I was applying for support, the National Institutes of Mental Health were trying to support computer usage for various kinds of support for thinking or working or something. So, actually sent a sight committee out and they said, \"This all very interesting\" but finally when they assessed it all they said \"Well very interesting proposal about what you want to do but, what you want to do requires quite a bit of sophisticated computer programming and since your way out there in Palo Alto where there isn't any, we don't think it's justified to put our money out there.\"<br><br><br><br>Enter ARPA<br><br>JE: Little did they know.<br><br>DE: So it wasn't until opened it's information processing techniques office, JCR and Rip Liner came to do that, and he was talking about manned computer symbioses and timesharing. He said \"Well just out of embarrassment I have got to give this guy money because he's talking about the same kind of thing as me.\" But, I learned from other <b>people</b> some time later that he also felt that way out there, there wasn't much chance but he sort of was forced to give it anyway.<br><br>JE: So you cobbled together essentially a group, now this isn't ARC yet is it?<br><br>DE: No, see that was just me and there were a few <b>people</b> I was trying to talk with but mostly working on that report was totally solo solitary work and...<br><br>JE: Did you meet much resistance as far as just working on the report?<br><br>DE: SRI didn't want to spend the money, as soon as I <b>started</b> doing that work, the papers I'd write, the think pieces, <b>people</b> would look at and say \"Gee, we used to think that you were such a clear writer. Look here, you've got twenty pages trying to describe some thing. I look all through that and I can hardly figure out what you're trying to talk about. Now look, here's a one page proposal by Bill over here he describes his problem his approach and all that in one page.\" So, I said \"Well that's really different. Here there aren't even the terms to describe.\" There was enough suspicion in fact which the first money that we <b>started</b> to get they wouldn't even let me be the project manager because they thought y'know \"Look, it's so vague and so...\" So, it wasn't until the second year, I'm not sure that should ever get published.<br><br>JE: Not until the second year could you actually get your hands on your own money.<br><br>DE: Then the sponsor found out about it and it was just real luck to be able to get support because as it turned out the particular approaches I was taking and the rational behind it weren't shared by not only by the SRI <b>people</b> but by the sponsors that, just parts of it that they came to appreciate or something and some reason or another hung on to give me the support for the years. As it turned out later that there was a big feeling in the research community that I was on the wrong track and that \"Oh the mouse is a cute thing\" and a few things like that, \"Working with displays, yeah that's good but here we're doing it better, now <b>people</b> are going to menus instead, and you're too complex\". So we had things like client server architectures built into it with remote procedure call protocols working and, built into the system and just a lot of architectural things that were, everyone just pictured them as being way too complex.<br><br><br></div><div id='full_3'><mark>Aumenting Systems<br><br>JE: These had fallen out naturally from your vision of what a computer could do for groups of <b>people</b> and they're working to augment their...<br><br>DE: That'd be your augmented knowledge workshop and it would be, therefore groups of <b>people</b> and they're all looking through their windows into a common workshop and you would have to have the things like servers and such and such that you could all get access to and electronic mail built into it by <b>nineteen</b> <b>seventy</b> and as I mentioned in there the system called The Journal which, y'know a document gets submitted to that and it's like publishing.</mark></div><div> Taking that out in the world there are lots of real world applications, it's just a huge winner kind of capability and it's funny the world just hasn't heard that yet or something. But, what we found through the years when we got shut down from the research kind of world in <b>nineteen</b> <b>seventy</b>-six and I actually got removed from my laboratory directorship and they were just going to shut it all down, we convinced them that they should auction, y'know that the system we built was rugged enough to be out in the commercial world, they had the commercial rights so they should try...<br><br>JE: Try actually selling it.<br><br>DE: So, after three months of...<br><br>JE: This is the augment system.<br><br>DE: Yeah, and Tymshare happened to be the winning bidder and it was a steal. They're the ones that we named it augment.<br><br>JE: I see. What had you called it?<br><br>DE: NLS.<br><br><br><br>On to Xerox PARC<br><br>JE: Oh yeah, NLS, that's right. Online system.<br><br>DE: So, quite a few of our <b>people</b>, a few of them had already gone over to work at socks parks when it <b>started</b> in <b>seventy</b>-one or something like that and they sort of made it clear that they were interested in almost any of our central guys who could come over. So that when this close down <b>started</b> it was just a real mass exodus over there. But, Tymshare when they bought the system needed some <b>people</b> to operate it and they said \"Well, we'll take any of the crew that wants to come.\" So, I showed up with it. The perception that they had picked up from SRI was that I was off the beam, not to be trusted. So it turned out they wouldn't even let me talk to customers.<br><br><br><br>Tired Approaches Towards Computers<br><br>JE: That's funny because they bid essentially on the system and the group and so forth, and you had created it. Very strange, <b>people</b> are odd.<br><br>DE: Well, we're all wrong like that it's the way our...as I mentioned there the paradigm <b>people</b> operate on what there assumptions are a lot of them unexamined assumptions about how things are and where they're going, that it's a time of change that's faster than paradigms are shifting so, what are computers for etcetera. Still the biggest impediment for me is that my perception and vision of what the technology can mean when we learn how to integrate it into our organizations and life and how much will change in order to harness it, has just consistently been much different from other <b>people</b>s...<br><br>JE: Well that certainly is true, I love the, I think it was in, I read quite a few articles and one of them either about you or that you wrote quotes a colleague of yours saying he wouldn't know what to do if the response was faster than twenty minutes.<br><br>DE: Yeah, that was the guy that <b>started</b> computer science at Stanford.<br><br>JE: So just a total sort of batch mode mind set.<br><br>DE: Yeah that's right and the other was \"What, use a computer just for editing\" and I said \"No, wait a minute, when your on-line there's a lot more you can do. While your there why don't you get the computer to help you with all these other little things.\" and they'd laugh \"You mean automatic line-wrap\" and they would just laugh. \"You want to use a whole computer just to do that?\" and I said \"No, it's your whole vehicle of working so while you're there look at all the things it can do for you.\"<br><br><br><br>New Paradigms<br><br>JE: You had thought about interfaces, I take it, very early. In the sense that it's really through workable interfaces that you get to the machine that can augment your work, I mean if you had a bad interface how could you augment, your intelligence and your capacity for work. So, I suppose that's where your were thinking about things like word-wrap, full screen editing, all of that.<br><br>DE: And more. You know, it's the interface between a human and this whole augmentation system, which is so much more than just the technology, it's all of what I call the human system and y'know the clothes we wear, the facilities we have, the language we employ, the methods, the conventions, the customs. All of those things are things we've had to learn and interface with. So, you're interfacing with a lot more than just your pencil or something. And so, look as all that changes we can consider... Do you know what matching <b>impedances</b> is?<br><br>JE: Mmm-hmm<br><br>DE: Right, it's like saying \"Hey, look you've got machinery in here, metal machinery and all kinds of motor sensory machinery that can do terrific things, \"I can ride a bicycle backwards\" <b>people</b> skateboarding all of that stuff, things that y'know we didn't think natively we were evolved to be able to do, so what makes you think that the conventions for externalizing our symbols or communicating or manipulating them in any way are an optimum match to our basic mental motor sensory capabilities. That whole interface can change the very language and the very structure and the very modes we portray our symbols and communicate and think. They could totally look for redesigning to make a better match and we never had the opportunity like that. So we think that that's the way knowledge, the hard copy is the way knowledge goes and <b>people</b> still are armed with \"Hey, desk-top publishing and whizzi-wig is the way to go\" and I kept saying \"That was the way but don't stay anchored with that look at the options\" and so the whole thing about hypertext and structured and all the optual views we built into the system and the way in which you also stay oriented about where you are in that knowledge space and all the optual ways in which you can get to other places, or reach to other objects on there to manipulate them. People all do the point and drag stuff as that's the way to do it, well that's a new way to do it but if that's the only way you're missing a tremendous amount.<br><br><br><br>Combining Chords<br><br>JE: I noticed that your involved with or had designed or at least worked with a number of input devices besides the mouse. There were several keyboards that worked on the principle of combinations of...<br><br>DE: Chords.<br><br>JE: Yeah, chords and that kind of thing.<br><br>DE: Yeah that was distinctly, I had to force that in to that. </div><div id='full_2'><mark>That was part of it and the two together, we demonstrated that in <b>sixty</b>-eight but <b>people</b> just out of hand rejected that keyset thing<br><br>(Break in tape)<br><br><br><br>New Ideas/Old Traditions<br><br>JE: Yeah, for the tape I was just saying that your, the interfaces that you created for that <b>nineteen</b> <b>sixty</b>-eight demonstration, IEEE was it?</mark></div><div><br><br>DE: No, it was the fall Joint Computer Conference. They had two a year and that was the two computer conferences.<br><br>JE: Right. </div><div id='full_1'><mark>And that interface still looked good when I first saw it in the <b>nineteen</b> <b>eighties</b> so it must have been a real revelation in <b>nineteen</b> <b>sixty</b>-eight if not a total shock but you were saying the reaction was kind of mixed or?</mark></div><div><br><br>DE: Well it really seemed to build a lot of excitement or something like that but the strangest part about that was we thought that during the next year we would see a lot of interest in pursuing that it was almost as though it didn't relate to the real world there would be <b>people</b> who'd come by and see demonstrations and say \"Wow\". But I began to realize over the following years that somehow it didn't connect with their perception of their own future. Y'know it's as if you'd gone to some laboratory and seen some <b>people</b> <b>strap</b> things on their backs that let them levitate and move around and \"Oh that's all very interesting but that has nothing to do with my own future\".<br><br>JE: Gosh, that is surprising, I must say. It's very hard for <b>people</b> to see, myself included.<br><br>DE: Well this is one of the biggest single problems. I keep saying that the perception <b>people</b> have of the future, of what it's potential is, of what there is to do about it etcetera, is the biggest single problem in mankind's ability in the future to harness technology and really take advantage of it...<br><br>(End side 1)<br><br>JE: ...implicit assumption that's not examined.<br><br>DE: That the large parts of our world that are being taken for granted and they're not being examined ever or being considered as candidates for change, for explicit planned change. And yet the rapidity with which really dramatic scale changes are occurring in what the capabilities of technology are, are such that by the time that really gets integrated into the whole, our whole social human system there's a lot of adaptation to be made. That's why we were talking about this, how you match <b>impedances</b> really with<br><br>JE: Yes, and the impedance of computers personal computers actually if you think about it is still rather high, I mean computers are still really too hard to use.<br><br>DE: But when I talk about matching <b>impedances</b> it's sort of...<br><br>JE: To get resonance.<br><br>DE: To get the maximum transfer of power is what impedance matching is all about so the maximum transfer of knowledge and directed capability and as a matter of fact that hard to use thing is just, that's another image which you'd say \"Alright, okay Jon you have to reexamine your own paradigm there\".<br><br>JE: And adjust it to the computer.<br><br>DE: No, adjust it to what it is that will let you best harness the computer. I make analogies like in automobile world or something like that if you'd ask <b>people</b> in <b>nineteen</b> ten when you could still buy different kinds of cars from <b>people</b> what their perception would be of how it was all going to get integrated into our world and they'd never have conceived of how much complexity there is in all you have to know in order to ...<br><br>JE: That's right in one of the articles here. It's a good analogy of all the skills you would need to keep the thing going down the road<br><br>DE: And another thing I point out is if you get these self propelled wheeled vehicles that make an interesting way to get around if that easy to use kind of picture was there everybody would still be riding tricycles cause a bicycle is just something that's totally more difficult. There's no natural way to think about riding a bicycle in fact most <b>people</b> don't even know what it is their body is automatically doing in order to ride a bicycle.<br><br><br><br>ETLANTU<br><br>JE: Now what is the acronym that you developed ETLANTU or something. Easy To Learn And...<br><br>DE: Natural To Use.<br><br>JE: Natural To Use, right, yes.<br><br>DE: So anyway that's, I finally made a paradigm map. Twelve or thirteen boxes around a sort of a loop. If you start out thinking a serious objective make organizations much more capable of coping now I call it boosting their collective IQ's. The different stages in the way I thought about it and developed the approach in which there are really different ways of thinking that sort of have to be admitted to the dialog in order for me to say \"There's the picture\".<br><br><br><br>Outline Processors<br><br>JE: Y'know one thing did bother me a little bit when you were talking about, or one of the articles was talking about this and that is many of your concepts have made the computer easier to use. The famous ones are the interface devices or conceptual devices. So you see this as sort of a two way two agent street that is that <b>people</b> should work to develop the skills that allow them the best impedance matching and the computer also we have to do things with the computers to try to aid that matching is that sort of the idea.<br><br>DE: Right, I can outline processor y'know it's really sort of a way in that which <b>people</b> can do well at trying to get things organized in the hierarchy and the outline processor really helps as you learn how to use it. But it's a, y'know that's an unnatural, we've never had that sort of thing before but why avoid it because it's different. Cause I remember one of the best software guys that came and worked for me just like this he says \"I don't think that way and your not gonna make me start.\" and I said \"Okay\". But, you work there a while and you very quietly start realizing how easy it is to tuck these things down and rearrange it and then when he <b>started</b> doing his programming that way he just became a convert.<br><br>JE: I don't know if I understand the outline processor concept as well as I'd like to. I use the outliner in Microsoft Word a lot, I mean I do a lot of outlining before I write is that the sort of thing that your thinking about. So the say Microsoft Word outline features is sort of an outline processor.<br><br>DE: Yeah it's sort of like saying why wasn't that introduced at the outset in word processors. See we were trying to, that was part of the <b>sixty</b>-eight thing and part of our system from the beginning. Y'know you specifically establish that in your document. Another paradigm issue is what's a document and as long as the orientation is that a document is this printed thing then what you have in the computer is just getting ready for it and is whizzi-wig. So if you start using an outline processor and start folding things etcetera and different views then your sort of shifting away from the normal.Well way back there we said externilizing your concepts and your symbols outside has been one way that technology's from ppapyrus on up, we get use to that there's a lot of conventions for doing that. Well if we externalize them into this other medium of which were going to work then there are just a lot more options for the way in which that can make a better map of what's in your head. That's what led me directly, thinking like that it was just like \"Oh, jesus\". The computer can show all sorts of relationships that you can't show on paper and so why not, and the computer help you get that there and get that structure relationships and he;lp you view it and help you move around, so why not.<br><br><br><br>Management Organization and Transformation<br><br>JE: The <b>sixty</b>-eight presentation is that, do you see that as one of the high points or the high point of the work you were doing at SRI, or was that just another station along the way?<br><br>DE: What we had to show by then was just along the way and y'know every year after that more and more was added and then the experience of working with organizations out there and getting more and more clear about how much shift there would be and actually more respect for the complexity of changing organizations and learning pragmatically about all of the very natural impediments to bring it in. But,nobody that's serious about working on his job was ever sort of indoctrinated into his <b>career</b> role or something with the orientation of how much change that'd be coming about, so to introduce that and to have <b>people</b> suddenly think that \"God, I've worked this long to become a manager of this etcetera like that and suddenly your expecting me to move into a different working mode etcetera in which, hell, in the first place I'll look stupid and I don't have as much time as the younger guys do to change and what happens to me?\" so he says \"Oh, you gotta start, you have to provide for a lot of the very natural things.\"<br><br></div><div id='full_4'><mark>JE: It's fascinating you've been saying this really since the sixties and yet it's been very hard for large organizations to really incorporate that into their actions because the greatest, over the years through the late seventies and <b>eighties</b> the greatest complaint on heard was that organizations were not spending enough time really thinking about the effects of this change that your talking about here so it must have been just as hard for the top management to get thinking about this as it is for the kinds of <b>people</b> your describing to actually make the shift.</mark></div><div><br><br>DE: The job and working environment for the top management is going to change a great deal too.<br><br>JE: I imagine that they are going to resist that.<br><br>DE: Who that they feel understands their world is going to them a different world. Y'know the consultants that are out there that talk about high level strategies and management in organizations they're not oriented yet for the change that's coming. Indeed who's responsible for mapping that future, that's the kind of thing we got into in the video and the change in the organizations is something that has just always happened really slowly and organically and the opportunity now for terrific change to gain terrific advantages is there but there is no precedent for making that conversion rapidly there aren't the processes, there aren't the improvement processes there, there aren't the ways,... I've got, some of my slides, if I talk about what I call the tool system is all the technologies that we apply, hardware and software and the human system is all the conventions and methods and all of that and I sort of laid it out in a two-dimensional plane and I say we're down here near the origin of that two-dimensional thing now that there all these technologies we can anticipate tremendous sort of things. Huge band with wireless things always with us connected to any kind of databases anyplace in the world high speed networks. And the other dimension is all of the changes that are possible in your organizational and human system so someway your not just going to go puttering along that x-axis because you can't really take advantage of that without the other. So, what is your path going to be out into that two-dimensional space and where are you going to end up settling best in five years and twenty years etcetera, nobody's explored that space to be able to tell you. So, who can tell you if your the guy to decide for some big organization, where your going to be and how to get there most effectively. There's no exploration in that space, you can't do it in a university you've got to do it with real world outposts.<br><br><br><br>Boot-<b>strap</b> Work<br><br>JE: Now is that the main focus of the boot-<b>strap</b> work?<br><br>DE: Yeah, the main focus of boot<b>strap</b> is to say \"given that, what's the best strategy for getting organizations out there and what's a really pragmatic evolutionary approach, and that's the boot<b>strap</b>ping thing so that it ends up saying there's a particular kind of <b>consortion</b> that you can make with organizations that can be the same kind but it's almost better if they're a different kind. </div><div id='full_0'><mark>At the outset you'd be expecting them not to make great big investments so half a million a year for the first couple years among six to ten of them would get a great start and in the process there as you start reclarifying what we call the improvement infrastructure and that this <b>consortion</b> becomes an integral part of that improvement infrastructure and that it's relationship with the other organizations gets really dynamic and working and bonding it's not like a <b>consortion</b> where you send your money to some central place your <b>people</b> are in and out and in the <b>consortion</b> your making that the first level most advanced outpost you can and it's got a very explicit purposeful set of capabilities it's going to enhance and in a way in a networked way they can start really using that network collaboration to facilitate the improvement process of every organization directly.</mark></div><div><br><br>JE: Now as I understand it you've tried to do this in some private programs in your own organization, is that right? Or, have you been able to get pilot programs <b>started</b> in other organizations?<br><br>DE: Well, over the years up until eighty-eight or so, the Tymshare activity and the later the McDonnell Douglas and in some of the customer they have quite a few pilot operations there that taught us a lot but they were never structured in this same boot-<b>strap</b>ping way but they teach you a great deal anyway. We're trying now to, y'know we've been trying to get this <b>consortion</b> <b>started</b> and it looks like it's beginning to make headway but it's the kind of the thing where it's very clear if you watch the inside of any busy barge or organization you realize that there isn't a decision point in there where the person who has to make some of these decisions about that has a chance to get the experience and the assurance that they can stick money in the, that's farther out.<br><br>JE: You'd have to make it kind of cold, right?<br><br>DE: What we're trying to do is sort of boot-<b>strap</b> that. It's sort of like keep it at a relatively modest, y'know half-a-million a year is not a very big deal once they sort of feel like getting ready. It's gotten to be a big deal in the last couple of years when everybody is downsizing and cutting cost...<br><br>JE: Oh, right, yeah.<br><br>DE: and it's gotten to a really dangerous extent.<br><br>JE: Well it acquires a momentum all it's own and <b>people</b> begin downsizing and the word has been applied dumbsizing, y'know just for the sake of doing it.<br><br>DE: Well down in costcutting and that everything is too, unfortunately we've got to watch this next quarter so that we don't have any long term. So, part of our strategy is just saying look whatever you do have y'know there's going to be a lot of change and some are going to survive and others aren't, who's going to come out on top? and he says \"Whatever you do have to invest in this improving and changing you better have the best strategy you can for that investment\" and that's what we're offering.<br><br><br><br>Dividing Time<br><br>JE: In your Tymshare period and then McDonnell Douglas buy's out Tymshare right and was there a large change between Tymshare and McDonnell Douglas or, I mean were you able to flow your work from Tymshare to the McDonnell Douglas work fairly easily?<br><br>DE: In the first place I have to describe that the operation of the business of selling augment services etcetera through Tymnet and Opernet was something that I wasn't in, that they kept me off to the side. So, I couldn't influence it very much. But, the business side of it wouldn't let me talk to the customers. It became quite clear that it was an explicit shielding. For one because they said they knew the timesharing business and \"if you start involving customers the main thing they'll do is start wanting the system changed and you'll have to spend more and more on system changes\" and we said \"Yeah but if there's this much transition going to come about then they need to be involved.\" \"I don't know, we know better than you, you guys come from this ivory tower stuff\". But when McDonnell Douglas took over there wasn't a direct link between aerospace side of it, but I could go commute to St. Louis and start talking to aerospace <b>people</b> and there with groups that were involved in thinking about the corporate architectures for the information systems and trying to improve capabilities etcetera<br><br>JE: And you had access to it?<br><br>DE: Right, but to get that I had to actually shift my organizational to whom I was attached to some person who ran a small office in the regular aerospace in St. Louis, who I actually never met who said \"Alright, we can put you here as long as the funding comes\" so another group say's \"We'll give him the funding\" and this guy says \"I don't even have the time to give you reviews\" \"Well, okay, this will only be a year or so\"<br><br>JE: That might be alright.<br><br>DE: No, I meant that you didn't get any salary increases.<br><br>JE: Oh.<br><br>DE: So, I had to go through that for about four years or so.<br><br>JE: I thought you were talking about program reviews, sometimes if they don't do anything they sort of keep hands off you, which has some advantages.<br><br>DE: Well that part was all just trying to build it up so we, anyway it was just very instructive being inside a big organization like that, of trying, trying to see how some of the successful executives were extremely risk aversion y'know where they're not really going to stick there necks out at all because if you do anything that <b>people</b> can chip away at you about you lose position.<br><br><br><br>Exodus to Xerox PARC (Revisited)<br><br>JE: Yes, that may have been one of the factors involved in the problems that Xerox had in not being able to get (?Alto?) out the door. You mentioned that a number of your SRI <b>people</b> went to Xerox PARC, sort of when it <b>started</b>, around <b>seventy</b>-one you think.<br><br>DE: Well a few of them went over early and the real move came around <b>seventy</b>-six when they <b>started</b> saying,... it was obvious that our program was feeling we weren't going the right direction and was starting to pull it's support and SRI actually put someone else in charge of my lab who had very different perception, very, very different about it. So, just within weeks <b>people</b> <b>started</b> trotting down the street to park. So, they ended up with like fourteen of them.<br><br>JE: There was no formal connection between your lab at SRI and Xerox Park, there was a real sort of <b>people</b> connection I take it.<br><br>DE: The majority of the <b>people</b> brought into park were <b>people</b> hired from the university (Standford - ed.) and Bob Taylor who was hired early had been a director at ARPA of the information processing office so he knew all the <b>people</b> etcetera and pulled them together. So, a large part all knew at least knew the names. And then when park first <b>started</b> up they didn't have any computers so some of those <b>people</b> would come over to our lab and hang out and use NLS and we actually <b>started</b> a joint developmental language.<br><br><br><br>NLS and the Alto<br><br>JE: A number of the features of the Alto certainly reflect your idea's and in fact that's a remarkable machine, when I take <b>people</b> through our exhibit I will ask them to guess how old this machine is, we have the Alto and I show them the mouse and we have a simulated screen and so forth, and nobody guess' <b>seventy</b>-three. So, I presume that Sort of happened because of the <b>people</b> who went over there.<br><br>DE: I don't really know. Y'know I didn't get invited to come be a part of that and the <b>people</b> that went over would tell me that the <b>people</b> were taking the mouse and some of the things like that but for some reason there's an antipathy, an explicit antipathy about NLS that basically <b>people</b> aren't accepting it as a place to go from.<br><br>JE: It's clear that you were way ahead in thinking about the possibilities for groupware and that kind of thing, which looked to me essentially as though it were built in NLS very early on. It looks as though they took sort of specific pieces of, specific concepts and so forth but, not the sort of larger data concepts and networking concepts and that kind of thing although I guess that, if I recall, that the Alto was on some sort of a network...<br><br>DE: But it wasn't shared stuff.<br><br>JE: Yeah, it wasn't really shared.<br><br><br><br>Frustrations<br><br>DE: When they were building the, there was the next big system...<br><br>JE: Star.<br><br>DE: Star, yeah. So, that was definitely a networked thing and there were four of the activities, the applications, the network system, the hardware, and operating system, I don't know but four of the guys from my lab headed each of those parts of that thing so there were more in the pursuit of the remote procedure called protocol, they published an early one, the guy who wrote that had been in our lab too and I called him up later and said \"Gee, how big a subset of our remote procedure called protocol that we actually built into our system, how large a part of yours did we actually have?\". He said \"Actually it's the other way around, we published you as only a subset of what we built\". There was very little communication that I just somehow didn't feel welcome and whether it's my own problem or what.

Improve our <b>collective</b> IQ? In the <b>dreams</b> of this  visionary inventor it can.\" <br><br>Photo of Doug in his home by David Toerge 1995<br>COMMENTARY :: Douglas Engelbart<br>for BYTE <b>magazine</b><br><br>Digital technology could help make this a better world. But we've also got to change our way of thinking.<br><br>Despite the rapid progression of computing technology, the world faces incredible <b>hazards</b> as we enter a common economic-political vehicle, traveling at an ever-accelerating pace through increasingly complex <b>terrain</b>. Our headlights are much too dim and <b>blurry</b>, and we have totally inadequate steering and <b>braking</b> controls.<br><br>Many years ago, I dreamed that digital technology could greatly augment our <b>collective</b> human capabilities for dealing with complex, urgent problems. Computers, high-speed communications, displays, interfaces \ufffd it's as if suddenly, in an evolutionary sense, we're getting a super new nervous system to upgrade our <b>collective</b> social organisms. </div><div id='full_3'><mark>I dreamed that people were talking seriously about the potential of harnessing that technological and social nervous system to improve the <b>collective</b> IQ of our various organizations.</mark></div><div><br><br></div><div id='full_4'><mark>Then I dreamed that we got strategic and began to form cooperative <b>alliances</b> of organizations, employing advanced networked computer tools and methods to develop and apply new <b>collective</b> knowledge.</mark></div><div> Call these <b>alliances</b> NICs (Networked Improvement Communities). This seemed eminently sensible. The new technologies could enable much more effective distributed collaboration, and the potential for shared risk and multiplied benefits seemed promising.<br><br>In the dream, the solution involves giving high priority to the <b>collective</b> capability for a distributed community (or organization) to develop, integrate, and apply new knowledge. We already had this capability, of course; organizations handle new <b>collective</b> problems all the time. But yes, it would be nice if we could be a lot more effective at it. In the dream, this collaborative capability was called CoDIAK, for Concurrent Development, Integration, and Application of Knowledge.<br><br>Sounds great. The better we get, the better we get at getting better. Call it bootstrapping. And just think of the important role for technologists.<br><br>Although exciting new technology innovations have indeed been introduced within the NICs, the technology efforts have been <b>overshadowed</b> by the concurrent efforts in \"human-system\" innovation. This includes new skills, methods, collaborative organizational structures, <b>telecommuting</b>, knowledge-worker teams, distributed goal setting, planning and management processes.<br><br>One of the ideas computer-oriented folks have contributed is the open <b>hyperdocument</b> system. For this to make a difference, we must shed our <b>outdated</b> concept of a document. We need to think in terms of flexible jumping and viewing options. The objects assembled into a document should be dealt with explicitly as <b>representaions</b> of kernel concepts in the authors' minds, and explicit structuring options have to be utilized to provide a much enhanced mapping of the source concept structures.<br><br>The Web/HTML ( Hypertext Markup Language) publishing-browsing <b>landslide</b> has moved steadily toward a highly structured, object-oriented architecture with integrated editor-browser tool sets. But his needs to become the way the majority of people do all their work. Draft notes, E-mail, plans, source code, to-do lists, what have you \ufffd all can be <b>hyperdocument</b> pieces, instantly and intrinsically linkable, and with work processes involving <b>fewer</b> and <b>fewer</b> hard-copy printouts.<br><br>It has been exciting to watch the emergence of total-quality management, process <b>reengineering</b>, NII (National Information Infrastructure), the World Wide Web, and so forth. But it pains me that we haven't yet put up an explicit CoDIAK target, nor explored how NICs could fly. </div><div id='full_2'><mark>Since the first of these <b>dreams</b> got fixed in my head, decades ago, I've struggled with the realization that the sooner the world gets serious about pursuing the possibilities, the greater the chance that we can reduce the <b>hazards</b> facing this careening <b>vessel</b> carrying us along.</mark></div><div><br><br></div><div id='full_1'><mark>If the dream of improving human <b>destiny</b> doesn't move people, how about the thought that the companies that adopt the best CoDIAK-improvement strategy will have a significant competitive advantage.</mark></div><div> Wouldn't you want your group to have the highest <b>collective</b> IQ?<br><br>I <b>confess</b> that l am a <b>dreamer</b>. Someone once called me \"just a <b>dreamer</b>.\" That <b>offended</b> me, the \"just\" part; being a real <b>dreamer</b> is hard work. It really gets hard when you start believing in your <b>dreams</b>.</div>",

doesn't come with the machinery. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>What comes with the machinery is a latent capability to absorb skills and to sense things and generate perception. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>You have to adapt to an environment before you develop a capability infrastructure. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>There's

32, 31, 30 years ago. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>It just had a tremendous impact, but it also set me apart and created a great deal of isolation. </span><br><br><span

onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>Then you say the societies began these artifacts. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>That further enriched and all that but at introduction of every artifact would cause concurrent shifting and orientation over here. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>This was a big thing for me to start realizing. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>This evolution of this augmentation has been going on since way before history. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>I was thinking I was going to come

here. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>As this part evolved, we got say like the 1960 or 1970 era where we had lots of sophisticated stuff in here. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>At some point, that was quite a system. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>As you introduced all the computer technology, what's happening?

this, what's the mechanism, the process, the budget and stuff that's improving your improvement process? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>It turns out that it really starts to get some collaborative things. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>That's where 30 years ago, the business about supporting a certain knowledge worked. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>Basically it's collaborative, collective knowledge work or developing. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>That's where the CoDIAK term comes from.

onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>That's a constant thing going on. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>Facilitating that turned out in ways that to deploy it would have the highest leverage of any act than they would think of in these 30 years. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>The bootstrapping came out saying; we're going to go after CoDIAK very heavily. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>To do that I'm going to push as far ahead and as fast I can in the technology that will advance it. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>There are practical things about how you make big advances like moving from a tricycle to a bicycle. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>You don't do it by a whole bunch of people. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>You're trying to encourage to make it once, you got to do it by small teams. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>Then they find ways to move other and transfer the technology. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>The whole technology transfer is something you'd like to facilitate. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>The CoDIAK process, that's great. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>After they start working on those concepts, you get to the place where you say, \"Between 2 different organizations, the C activities are not that much different.\" </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>If the A activities might be very different but C aren't. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>A activities might be highly proprietary by the time you get down to C; it's easy to make an argument. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>Like the quality people are sharing a great deal of stuff in here. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>All right, why

</span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>I can go through the rest of all the details and all that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>The real thing would be a C community, consortium in the ways it can bootstrap its customers are your B people. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>Everybody in some real endeavor ought to have a customer that they really quality support. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>Who's supporting the B? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>B is the customer you see in your C community. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>A is the customer. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>Your outside customers are customers there, so you've got that whole thing focused on that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>You got to know your customers. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>A has to keep knowing about what's going on out there. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>B has to keep to knowing too. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>You want a 2-way flow, technology transfer, lots or lessons learned and objects et cetera. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>The model for how this community can work is a model for all kinds of projects collaborating projects going inside. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>The model for all that community can work is a model for how consortiums can work. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>A model for how the, a real network or business organizations. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>You think of some of the proposed new ways organizations can be structured. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>People are much more flexible when they're in working relationships et cetera. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>That's setting up the model for that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>I'm just so convinced that augmentation, the whole system approach is someday going to produce really extraordinary capabilities in organizations. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>I'm so convinced that the world needs it immensely that I absolutely cannot retire or sit down until this bootstrapping gets a start. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>Because I really feel that's a strategy that could a difference. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>This pledge I made 40 years ago how can I die without having tried it? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>I almost tried dying 5 years ago but I got cancer and got over that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>Because how could I finish this if I die of cancer? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>One of the interesting things, it could almost seem like an accident that I got invited here. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>Looked over the papers and heard the thing, read what's going on. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>It seems like it's a very novel community as it stands now in order to take on some of these things, the organizations. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>It'd be interesting to work more with you. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(127.21)'>The world needs dialogue and I need people to interact with because

</span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Doug:\tThe triggering action was getting engaged. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>The next Monday, driving to work ... One thing I have to background, is I grew up in the Depression, which leaves a lasting impact. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Lots of times you grow up in a depression and getting a steady job was a big thing, because a lot of your neighbors didn't have steady jobs or something like that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>I had a steady job. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>I was working as an electrical engineer, for what's now NASA. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Another thing is, you're going to

work I suddenly got to thinking of, \"What are my goals, career-wise, professionally?\" </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>It was the funniest experience to just suddenly realize other than having an interesting job and a steady one, I didn't have any, which shows to some extent kind of what a backwards country kid I was. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>I thought, \"Why don't I start setting up what could goals be?\" </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>For some reason, I realized earning a lot of money would be nice, but, \"Gee, you could probably do quite a few things that would be contributory or interesting and also earn enough money.\" </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>I set that aside. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>It wasn't very long before I tried on in my head, \"What if you try to maximize a contribution your career would make in society?\" </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>I have no idea where that comes from. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Sometimes, I almost curse it, because that locked me in, for some reason, to really thinking about that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Then started thinking about, \"I'm an engineer, and who needs more engineering? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>So, what are the things the world really needs? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Gee, it needs a more stable economy. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>It needs more education. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>It needs a bunch of things like that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Oh, and I should go try to make a crusade to do something singular in those fields. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Any of that, I'd probably have to go get refurbished as an economist or an educator, or something. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>I was 25, and do I want to go back and line up with the 18 year olds?\" </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>I kept thinking about crusades of all kinds. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>After 2 \u00bd months of that, I think it was, one Saturday morning, it suddenly dawned on me that crusades are very hard to design because the world is complex enough so you can't really be sure that you designed a solution that when it gets implemented isn't going to have side effects that are as bad as you were trying to cure. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>One example being, \"I guess I'll go in and try and clear up the swamps in this country, because of so much yellow fever. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>It's really hard on all the natives.\" </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>You do that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>In another generation, their population's grown so much that that's what's ruining that environment. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>[inaudible 00:09:23] One Saturday morning, it just dawned on me. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>It's very complex and getting more so. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Most of the complex challenges to society have to be dealt with <b>collectively</b> and our collective ability to deal with complex. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Urgent issues and problems, isn't increasing nearly as fast as the complexity and urgency are. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>This was 1951. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>I was an electrical engineer and I've been interestingly enough I've been a radar technician in the Navy during World War 2 and so I knew how radar screens could draw pictures and how simple digital stuff in there could handle things. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>I read about computers so I knew that anything if a computer can punch cards or print paper they can draw anything you want on a screen. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>I also knew because that radar that you can sample what the operator is doing so they can keep track of what you're doing and you can interact with the computer. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Now that will let you use all kinds of new symbology on the cathode ray tube screen and colleagues of yours could sit around tied to the same complex and you'd collaborate. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>It'd be a totally new different way to try to connect to your brain. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>It's embarrassing to say that that's the kind of thing I just tied my life to. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>My young fianc\u00e9e was looking forward to settling down. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>She'd

onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>\u201cOh dear I've gotten accepted to graduate school at Berkeley because I'm building a computer there.\u201d Being off on that now it's been every year since then pursuing that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>There are a lot of stages I can tell you about its evolution including the last is when Christina, one of my daughter has teamed up with me to form an institute that's really trying to sell the world on a real strategic approach to try to do this. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>If I kept talking long enough he

to you as you look back over the last 3 decades? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Doug:\tThis may surprise you but it's how slow it's moving and how hard it is to get people to look ahead far enough. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>To me that's ... in times of such explosive change as this the paradigms that are really guiding and settling the world's way of looking at things have to shift in concordance with that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>They have to get farther ahead and that just hasn't been happening. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>That was a surprise to me but it's also very valuable lesson. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Speaker 1:\tIn terms of things that might be frustrating to you having been a bit ahead of most of the rest of us it would be in the area of speed with which things have occurred or the lack of a continuing forward going vision like what's the next big evolution of technology\r\n\r\nDoug:\tThe frustration was basically that there wasn't any place for me to connect. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>We had really a flowering laboratory in the \u201860s and \u201870s and most of things I get allotted for were generated during that period was supported by ARPA and somewhat other government agencies but we were just really trying to build a news and evolve could really make a difference. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Then we're at a cross people's perception began to be so much different about automate your offices etc. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>on the one hand so you're just automating. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>The other hand it was the artificial intelligence people saying we're going to make such smart computers that they'll sit there and they'll make a model of the user and they'll find out what the user can do and knows and needs and then they'll match to that and the user won't have to learn anything. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Between the 2 of them I just got sent ... we lost all the support and had to go into commercial world. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>That was a very good eye opener. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>We had a system that was sturdy enough to be selling services. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>A history that goes back to the time when [BARPA 00:14:12] the government agency decided it was going to experiment with computer networking. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>They told the 13 of us principal investigators supported by ARPA and the interactive computing field. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Each of us had a time sharing computer that was experimenting. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>They told us that in order to experiment with a network they were going to tie us together. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>This horrified everybody else. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>It just thrilled me because I needed a community to interact and do this stuff. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>I volunteered to start and run a network information center for that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>For that purpose they made me the second computer tied to the network. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>All your internets I've been on it since day 1, since the packets got sent back and forth. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Seven or eight years later we got shut down because we were judged to be going in the wrong direction. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Ever since then it's been trying almost from the outside not being a part of real organizations and enough to steer things trying to sell and tell and just so many fruitless almost sales to every one of the big companies you know [Deq 00:15:23], Hewlett Packard and IBM we've knocked on doors. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>We almost had a real pilot going at McDonnell Douglas. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Anyway, we had things that could a lot of the stuff you're

all kinds of viewing options when you looked at a document that helped a great deal doing stuff. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>You had explicit hierarchical structure you could apply to it that would help you move around, get views etc. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>We had a way to put in documents that were unchangeable just like your publishing and linkage and reference from any place. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>We had multiple computers being able to [interconnect 00:16:22] between each other and it was a client server

exciting now to see it begin exploding. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>What I had to do during those years was think about the strategy of if it's really extremely complex set of

</span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>How well and rapidly would it do that? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>That's a sign of its collective IQ. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Anyway, you think of a country so you're start to engage it or something like that and you don't come up with very high numbers for the collective IQ you can reserve in

tremendous talent but it's connected very, very ineffectively. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Anyway, that's ...\r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tOkay do you have kinds of pictures? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Doug:\tGo ahead. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Speaker 1:\tIf we think about the point you just made communities of people working together creating a new knowledge, sharing that knowledge, developing insights that lead to actions in the marketplace, how would you see companies that want to be at the leading edge of this whole area identifying and using their collective IQ, what should they be doing <b>today</b> to do that? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>We are working hard to try to become more of a learning organization, knowledge creating and sharing. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>You've seen some demonstrations of some of the tools we're using. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>I'm interested in your thoughts and ideas because its right on your whole notion of collective IQ it also feeds to your idea of A, B and C which I might ask that you share with our group here <b>today</b> of how you take what you're doing and prove it and then improve the way you improve it. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Share with us your thoughts and ideas about what the really smart organizations ought to be doing <b>today</b> to get a better job in this whole area using communities of interest within the organization to create new knowledge and use it better? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Doug:\tThe basic thing is that there isn't anybody that knows the answers about what you really best could end up becoming or something. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>It's just more complex and certainly managing your knowledge is certainly important and collaboration is certainly important. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>What the configuration is going to be of how you change all the ways you work etc. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>there's nobody that knows. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Much less knows what the environment of proctor and <b>gamble</b> is going to be in 10 years. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>You have to be able to adapt both to the challenge of changing you internal mode so you get more effective as well as the challenge of adapting to a rapidly changing world. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>To me the most important thing comes this issue of how do you set up an <b>infrastructure</b> to guide your improvement and evolution so that that can be as reasonably as effective as possible. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>You can always give an answer that pushes it off to ask another question because you didn't ... next question please. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Speaker 1:\tI'd be very interested when you say build an <b>infrastructure</b> to do this better. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>What comes to mind when you about <b>infrastructure</b> in that regard? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Doug:\tShall we do this? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Speaker 1:\tSure. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Doug:\tAnyway this collective IQ we have this presentation that Christina and I have made in the past. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>It's based upon a macromedia director show and it oriented around this kind of set of boxes each of which is really a miniature modification to a paradigm. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>It turned out in the studies ... </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>There was 2 \u00bd year study I did between 1959 and 1962 that publication in our web that's got a German history technology group send us an email a few months ago and says, \u201cWe found that report and we put it on the web for you.\u201d It'd be very interesting so that that whole picture there was a very important one. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Much of what come across in these changes here sort of come out in raw form in that one and then more advances to it. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>What I could do is just very quickly show it to you by not just highlighting it like that but by highlighting with a center piece of information that tells a little bit about it. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>You start out with the objective of high performance organization and after a while studying that you begin to realize you don't just go change a couple of core competencies. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>That if you're going to have really radical change support systems like the technology, there is a whole <b>infrastructure</b> capabilities that makes an organization tick. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>You need to really consider all of that because there candidates all throughout that <b>infrastructure</b> candidates that the technology is going to be able to impact and such. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Then you say another thing that was a real breakthrough for our techie guy who I had been thinking for 10 years and about the tools was this thing about saying, \u201cYou're going to augment people and you're thinking of all the tools but for the radical things coming on, there's a whole set of skills and knowledge and roles and even your language and the way you portray things and everything else that they're going to impact. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Then the realization that what makes your organization capable in the first place is a system that augments you.\u201d It starts out with developing a language and such as that when you're in the cultures that you acculturated with in the schools etc. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>your family and then the particular professional skills you do. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Then the facilities that are put together that are made all this but all the conventions about how you organize groups, how you lead them, what kind of roles you have in there, how you establish a committee and stuff, there's a huge amount of invention in that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>It's the combined of those 2 that augments all of us so our latent natural capabilities are able to connect together and do what we can do. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Then saying it's a revolution coming in this tool system so that's going to take that in order to accommodate that it's going to be a comparable, collateral revolution in the human system side. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>That just wasn't people language. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>You have to work together and this led to us saying \u201cOur approach has got to be a pragmatic coevolution. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>I'm extremely pleased.\u201d When the discussion is going on in this group <b>today</b> so far that I've heard it its right out there. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>You got human resources, you got all kinds of other stuff talking about how we collaterally coevolve these things but that's a big important thing. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>One other thing is to realize what's the scale of change that we need to accommodate. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>I've always been operating all this on this huge scale everything in the world that the scale of change and the rapidity of it and the technology in the digital world is just exceeding anything that any society in our world has ever had to cope with before in a <b>global</b> ... it's going to be an integrated <b>global</b> affected change and very complex and very fast. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>The cost to any organization about concurrently evolving with that is going to be much higher and the rate of change and stuff like that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Then you say \u201cWhat I need in that I need to consider the return on investment for my investment in change and improvement.\u201d I'd like to find strategy that instead of bump, bump, bump, bump everything like that well give me a compounded return. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Isn't that very businesslike of me? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Speaker 1:\tVery. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Doug:\tI knew about compound interest because of banking and the kids. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>I don't know much about business really. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Anyway this was ... you want to look for some kind of business like investment criteria for how you would really best in a strategic sense invest in your improvement or evolution. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>This comes out for centering on an improvement <b>infrastructure</b> because that base back here with your capability <b>infrastructure</b>. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Well some subpart of that is <b>infrastructure</b> that is employed to do your improvement. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>In a 62 paper or something like that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>I was really looking for how do you get that amplification. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>It suddenly start occurring to me that if in this change process I get it so that I can use some of the new capabilities that I'm bringing up into this capability <b>infrastructure</b>. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>If I can use it for this I get bootstrapping out of it. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>That I'm not only one major being more effective organization is boosting your product cycle. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Well if not only that if I can bring in new capabilities and if I had an appropriate improvement <b>infrastructure</b> and I plug those new capabilities into there, can I get an improvement cycle speeding and getting better too? </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>This is great. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>That's what led me into the particular kind of capabilities here that we call the collective IQ. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>To better way to frame this and build and work on and develop the ideas underneath that box are the same kind of things we can put into the improvement structure etc. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Then it says, \u201cYou're making headway. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>You're getting this collective IQ pursued etc.\u201d Then you need some there's one massive kind of requirement based upon this that you find these magic things that work for Procter & Gamble well you got to make sure that you can also work with the outside world and not island. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>This interoperability and we right at the time in the ... the <b>company</b> that bought us from Stanford Research Institute and the commercial time sharing business got bought up by McDonnell Douglas so I could have a chance to go and talk to the heavy industry people about their use of it. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>It was really terrific to find out how you could probably augment the whole process by which you develop an airplane design. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Not only that by the concurrently how you develop the manufacturing capability to do that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Not only that, by how you develop the community of top level suppliers who have to co-design things in your aircraft like that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Not only that, by how you can interoperate with the end users which have a great deal of interaction back and forth as you do the logistic support and the upgrading of models and something like that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>This interoperability was great. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Then this kind of a picture of the in the end what's got be needed out here is a <b>global</b>ly interoperable open hyper document system. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>We just invented that name in the late \u201880s as just saying it's inevitable. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>It's got to be hyper linkage multimedia and it has to be an open system. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>The html kind of thing in there is just proving that case where you can dive around and get into there. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>It doesn't mean it can't be all folded up and tucked away in a database system at all but conceptually it's still a document when you unfold it for the viewing etc. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>and then like that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>There are a lot of things if we dig down underneath that box there are a lot of things we did in there that are still open for exploration and such that other people haven't done. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Then there's a question of deploying all that which is a very important thing as you make headway within your organization how best to deploy it from a strategic point of view. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Out of that comes one of the important pictures about high performance teams that are selected and recruited and equipped and trained to be really high performance knowledge workers on new levels that you can't get by, by just getting to be good at what the current products can be harnessed and such like that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>There's a need to prototypes like that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Then you need to find ways to deploy them within an organization so they not only can effectively utilize that extra capability they have but that their interaction with that has a way for the other people in the organization to see and rub shoulders and get the feeling for what you're going to do if you can get trained etc. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>to new levels. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>This means in this open hyper document system you need a way in which you can have multiple grades of user proficiency with the appropriate interfaces for them and such. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>A lot of these strategic stuff comes out and if we possible to go after then you start talking about \u201cThen how you can do that if you have an improving <b>infrastructure</b> it's appropriate in the organization.\u201d Then you can actually hike that structure and move it up a little so that you can get coordinating, cooperating communities of organization saying \u201cThere's a lot in common that we could <b>collectively</b> work on that would help us improve our improvement process.\u201d\r\n\r\n\tIt goes on from there but that's the high level thing and we can spend 3 days and look deeper into it but I'm not going to. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>There are some really key things especially up in here and here and here and here. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Speaker 1:\tI think it would be quite interesting if you might be to share by way of example or concept the A, B, C approach that is in here but you didn't quite lay out in that very straightforward fashion like we did with [Dirk 00:35:35] earlier <b>today</b>. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>The concept here is Doug teases up is any organization is operating its business or its government a certain way <b>today</b> and probably every organization is trying to improve the way they do that. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>The first is A and the improvement is B. the thing that I found fascinating and elegantly simple in Doug's thinking is there's C how do you improve the way you improve and get that ROI curve to be compounded as opposed to incrementally growing. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>If you could tell us a bit more about that that would be great. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Doug:\tIt started with if you have a human and tool system you're augmenting your organization and you're going to want to go through this set of thinking. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>You start categorizing the activity that you find in the organization. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Everyday chunking along away and that includes hiring people and training them to do the jobs that are there <b>today</b> and doing product development the way you do and selling etc. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>etc., etc. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>If you're trying to improve any part of your augmentation system, then you put on a different hat and just give it a different name say its B activity. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>It's not an inventing new activity, it just inventing a label that helps do some thinking in a certain way. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>Then the idea if you're coming into an era of much more rapid complex change whereas B has been semi casual thing through all the years who put up a cross functional committee to do something that's going to improve this or that packaging or something. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>They work at it together and do their thing and it gets changed or you get a consultant to come in and make plan of change. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>You say, \u201cB is going to be so much more critical and we're going to live and die by it as much as we live and die by anything we do in any world.\u201d You say, \u201cYou want to improve that then you need to realize that if its serious work you got to give it another category.\u201d This A, B, C emerged and it really has helped a lot as basis for that <b>infrastructure</b>. </span><br><br><span onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'>You had some comments? </span><br><br><span id='full_1' onclick='player.seekTo(57.87)'><mark>Speaker 1:\tThe thing I find fascinating about this l think Procter & Gamble probably does a pretty good job with A&B but I'm not sure we thought too much about C.

I'm speaking with Douglas Engelbart who invented the computer mouse and much of the other technology that went into today's ... that goes into today's personal computers. I wanted to begin, um, by asking you about growing up in Oregon, and, um, my memory is that you grew up on a farm. Um, was it close to Portland?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: It was very, very small. It was just in a small farm area and, uh, where everybody had other jobs, uh, and ...<br><br>John Markoff: What did your parents do?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Well, my father, uh, uh, had developed a radio shop. He was a trained electrical engineer so very early radio, he, he said, \u201cI can capitalize on that.\u201d<br><br>John Markoff: So you were growing up outside of an urban area, but yet your father was a technical person.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah.<br><br>John Markoff: You ... That's the best of both worlds.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Well, the problem is he died when I was nine, and up until then, he's working very long hours in the Depression time to make things hold together.<br><br>John Markoff: I see.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: So I didn't get any technology from him.<br><br>John Markoff: You didn't grow up amongst the test, the tubes or anything?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: No.<br><br>John Markoff: No? Okay. How close to Portland was your, was your home? Was it Portland was the big city or was it ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Oh, yeah, we were about three or four miles outside the city limits.<br><br>John Markoff: I see. Oh.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: But it was a beautiful area, beautiful creek running right through our property and into 90 acres of untouched forest that was our backyard and, uh, and so that creek and that forest were terrific. And it was on a dead-end curvy road so it was very quiet and private and ...<br><br>John Markoff: And always raining.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: No. I <b>remember</b> two or three days [00:02:00] with sunshine. (laughs)<br><br>John Markoff: (laughs) And, um, after your father died, your mom stayed on the ... You, you stayed in the same place. You didn't move. Yeah.<br>Doug Engelbart: No.<br><br>John Markoff: Um, did you have any interest in technology while you were growing up, before you left home?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Well, I, uh, I liked to do a lot of things and I would invent things like ... And then I got interested in, in, uh, making a rope and, uh, so I found out that the gunny sacks that our grain came in to ... or our cow feed came in, uh, was strand by strand that I could pull the strands out and tie it and make a very, very long string, and then I would double that and twist it up and then double it again; it would make a rope. And then I would twist that up, and I ended up making a rope about 40 feet long, it was strong enough to her- ... hold my weight. And I would use that for climbing trees, and, um, and, you know, different funny boats.<br><br>\tAnd, uh, then one day when I was about 13 or 14, I found a, in an abandoned barn nearby, I found an abandoned car that just intrigued me very much. It had a brass radiator and kerosene parking lights and, uh, it was a 1916 model T Ford.<br><br>John Markoff: Oh my, god.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: That's even older than I am, see. (laughs)<br><br>John Markoff: Did you make it with ... Did it work or did you make it work again?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah. Yeah, I, I bought it for $10, uh, and, uh, hauled it home [audio g<b>lit</b>ch 00:03:37] home and spent the next year or so taking it all apart and getting it finally working. So it was just ...<br><br>John Markoff: Do you <b>remember</b> roughly how old were you when you did that?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Oh, 15. It's like we could drive on our back roads without licenses. (laughs)<br><br>John Markoff: But then you had a car to go to school with too.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Well, that was even [00:04:00] old in those days, it didn't have a ... It was the year before they started at- ... automatically putting on electric starters on cars.<br><br>John Markoff: And so you had to crank-start it?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yes, right. And then the electric, the headlights worked off a magneto so the faster the engine ran, the brighter the lights would get. See? And, uh, it was a, it was just a beautiful, <b>lit</b>tle, old car and that, anyway.<br><br>John Markoff: You went to Corvallis, a universi- ... The Oregon State University to, to college?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah.<br><br>John Markoff: And what did you study?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Well, I, I studied, I took ... There was an engineering student aiming for electrical engineering, but the main reason was the war had started when I was about 16, I guess, World War II, not the Civil War, and, uh ...<br><br>John Markoff: (laughs)<br><br>Doug Engelbart: (laughs) Then, there was a lot of talk about this secret thing called <b>radar</b> and, oh, the Navy had a program; they would train people to ta- ... maintain that. So it sounded so dramatic that, uh, you came into the classroom and they locked all the doors, then they took the, the textbooks out of the locked ... And then you had your class and then you put them all back in the vault and locked it up before they let you out of the classroom. And that just sounded so much, so that's why I started, I said, \u201cWell, I think I'll take electrical engineering because that would be it.\u201d<br><br>John Markoff: Do you think there was any connection between your dad's profession and your interest 10 years later in study? Was there a link at all or it was ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: If there were any, it would have been a negative one because when I was 10 or 11, I <b>remember</b> noticing the textbooks he studied in and looking at them and saying, \u201cOh, god, you're too much for me.\u201d So ... But it was that, that the secrecy of <b>radar</b> and the fact that I probably was going to get drafted, so I did get drafted and then I had that training, so I got into that Navy training program.<br><br>John Markoff: How many years did you go to school before you were drafted? Did you ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: It was exactly two.<br><br>John Markoff: [00:06:00] Ah, I see, so then you were drafted and you were sent off to operate <b>radar</b> systems in the Pacific.<br>Doug Engelbart: Well, I, I had a year's training first, all the basic training in all the kinds of equipment and the maintenance you had, and, uh, then you get to be a certified electronic technician.<br><br>John Markoff: Okay.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: And, uh ...<br><br>John Markoff: You told me a wonderful story about shipping out to the Pacific.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah.<br><br>John Markoff: Tell me the story of, of, of ... This was, this must have been \u201845, 1945.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: It was spring, and that's when I finished the training, and, uh, (clears <b>throat</b>), so they loaded us up on, on an old converted freight ship converted to a troop ship and, uh ... The San Francisco Harbor, but it was just south of the Bay Bridge in there. And, uh, we were all kind of nervous because we were going to go invade Japan, and there were soldiers, marines, sailors mixed there, and the boat backed out and trundled along underneath the Bay Bridge around towards the Golden Gate and out to sea.<br><br>\tAnd we just got part way past the Bay Bridge and, uh, the captain came out on the bridge and looked down on us, \u201cJapan just surrendered,\u201d he shouts. Oh my, gosh, you could just see. Then suddenly all ... uh, every, all kind of ... What is it? Propriety or something leaves us. We all said, \u201cWell, for Christ's sake, turn around.\u201d (laughs) And he goes like this and ... But anyway, it was a very different trip, so.<br><br>John Markoff: And I <b>remember</b> you hearing, you hearing the sounds from San Francisco as the people began celebrating as they went ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah.<br><br>John Markoff: ... out on ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Whistles blowing and ...<br><br>John Markoff: Yeah. Um, you had to go to the Pacific anyway. The war was over.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah. You can imagine that they could not, couldn't just stop everybody where they were, and so 38 days later at about 10 miles an hour, we got to the Philippines [00:08:00] and ...<br><br>John Markoff: And your job was a <b>radar</b>, <b>radar</b> operator.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: No, a technician that would be maintenance. So it wasn't just <b>radar</b>. Radar, radio, sonar, teletype, any kind of communication electronics and, uh ...<br><br>John Markoff: Okay. An, um, you were a reader by that time, a voracious reader? You, you liked to just sort of bur- ... burrow into ... was ... I mean ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Well, that's what I discovered. I had been a reader and curious way back. Then, in early years of college, I found a library and the stacks and how they were tolerant enough to let me go roaming in there. And I just did read a lot and ... huh.<br><br>John Markoff: So you found a reading room while you were on ... It was a small island, right? Where, where ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Oh. When we first landed in the Philippines, it's what they called a receiving ship, even though it was a camp in the jungle (laughs), right on the edge of the jungle in the island. And, uh, they dumped the shipload of people there and then you get assigned to different places and, and traveled from there in small groups to different assignments. So, uh, that one was, it was right on the edge of the jungle and, uh, interesting, but I discovered the native Filipino hut on stilts, thatched roof and everything that had a sign on it that said \u201cRed Cross Library.\u201d And, uh, you had to climb up the ladder into the nice, clean floor, about maybe 15 feet across, circular like this and books and magazines. (laughs) It's funny, so I started camping out there, you know, a lot of time there. I think I was there about four, five days or something like that, but, uh ...<br><br>John Markoff: Oh, so this was new, this was right after you ... It was early on.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Just when we got there.<br><br>John Markoff: Okay. Yeah, interesting.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: And so that's, that's when I found that LIFE Magazine [00:10:00] article that was sort of a takeoff of what Atlantic Monthly had had some months earlier, uh, that was Vannevar Bush and his Memex description.<br><br>John Markoff: And this was a machine that was ... There weren't really computers at this point. But this was a machine that was an information retrieval machine?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah. He ... A microfiche, uh, just a small size, uh, hunk of film that you can move and view and stuff and each one of them has center frames on it, etc. So he said what each one should do is sort of have what would be the equivalent of a link today is, you know, it's referring to some other one of those fiche and they'd like to have a mechanical thing that could go get it for you from the list. (clears <b>throat</b>) And it was never built, but that seemed intriguing. But that didn't surface for me ... Let's see. That was 1945.<br><br>John Markoff: It was five years later. I thought ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: It was 15 years later.<br><br>John Markoff: Oh, it was 15? Okay, we'll, we'll come to that. You also mentioned ... So, um, the <b>idea</b> of, the <b>idea</b> of hypertext. You stumbled across the <b>idea</b> of links and the abili- ... the abi<b>lit</b>y to, to the ... But you also ... I also <b>remember</b> you found a magazine article, and I don't <b>remember</b> the details, but it was about sort of making something with your life.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: How to make the most of your life.<br><br>John Markoff: Yes. What was that article? That was ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Oh, that was a book.<br><br>John Markoff: A book. Tell me a <b>lit</b>tle. I mean but it had an impression on you.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Oh yeah. That's, uh, I've never heard about, you know, trying to talk about how you can plan and etc. And, uh, you know, just totally the ... There was no professional discussions that I heard at all among my neighbors or anybody about planning careers, etc. And, uh, especially during the Depression when jobs are scarce. Most people were just happy to have steady jobs. And, uh, so I didn't [00:12:00] have any great thinking about that, but I found this book in the library in the ... where I was stationed in Manila for the year, and, uh, so the library there too was almost never anybody else in it (laughs), so I probed a lot.<br><br>\tSo that was one of the books I found, and it was, it was just one of the cheery kind of things about advice of how to tune your life and think positive and try for things, etc. But it somehow impressed me so much that, uh, it led me astray. I stole the book when I left. (laughs) But I didn't feel very guilty because almost no one was ever in the library. (laughs) And, uh ...<br><br>John Markoff: You, you came back to the West Coast and you finished your college degree in, in Oregon.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Right.<br><br>John Markoff: But now, when you went to Berkeley, did ... No? You ... Oh, that's right. You ... Before you went to Berkeley, you came to California?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah. I, uh, I just <b>happened</b> to take a job offer down here in the Silicon ... San Francisco area at the Ames Aeronautical Laboratory. And, uh, you know, various people had come from different companies, etc. to give talks and, and try to, uh, enlist graduating, graduating students. And so I had been signed up to go to General Electric back East, and then this fellow came from the Ames Laboratory here to talk about what could be done there, and, uh, then I <b>remember</b> how much fun it was in the San Francisco area because my last seven months of training were on the Navy, with the Navy owned Treasure Island at the time. And, um, so I thought, \u201cGee. That's fun. That's right near Stanford girls.\u201d (laughs) So, uh, for some reason, I signed up to come down here.<br><br>John Markoff: Now when you went to work, um, at Ames, [00:14:00] um, you ended up supporting the <b>wind</b> tunnels. Is that right?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah. Um, I thought I was coming to work in the instrumentation development group, but I got sort of waylaid as I first came in. See, the Greyhound bus I was on stopped at the stoplight (laughs) at Moffett Boulevard and 101. (laughs) I'm laughing now because it was not a freeway, so I trundled up there. And, uh, so it wasn't long before this talking <b>guy</b> came and, and, uh, intercepted and, and talked, talked me into, \u201cOh, it's much more interesting in this other group. You know, we take care of the <b>wind</b> tunnels and all that.\u201d Well, it was an education. Uh, so I was there three years before I got my ... whatever it is.<br><br>John Markoff: The ... Oh, I see. So before you decided that you needed to, to move on and ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Before I got the, the big turn on, uh ... I don't know. What, what do you call it? Just ...<br><br>John Markoff: A vision, in- ... insight, uh ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Well, the sequence of them. First, first soon after I got engaged, I suddenly realized I didn't have any goals professionally. Here are all these interesting goals about getting married and a family. And, uh, uh, so the day I realized that was the Monday after I got engaged, driving to work. Oh, I better get goals that worked. And for some reason, what flashed in my head that just changed my life forever was, \u201cOh, goal. Hey, that's interesting. I've never thought about having a, a real goal professionally.\u201d And that's how naive country <b>boy</b>. And so another na\u00efve country <b>boy</b>'s thing that what came up when I said, \u201cOh, that sounds good. Let's grab that as a goal.\u201d<br><br>\tAnd the goal, I, I ... Just was welded in my mind because it says, \u201cHey, why don't I pick a goal that will maximize the benefits my career will have to mankind?\u201d [00:16:00] Just your 25-year-old country <b>boy</b>, I don't know where it came from but it was just so clear and, uh ...<br><br>John Markoff: You were still at Ames at this point.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah.<br><br>John Markoff: Okay. [<b>crosstalk</b> 00:16:12] You were driving to work and ... Were you ... You weren't living in Atherton by that time. Where did you live at ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Oh, I, I was renting a room in, in Los Altos.<br><br>John Markoff: Okay. You were engaged, but you, you <b>guy</b>s weren't married yet.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Oh, I've been engaged for two days. (laughs)<br><br>John Markoff: (laughs) Okay. I want to go backwards for a second because there's, there's something I wanted to, to ask you about in terms of the way your thinking evolved. Um, you told me about, um, uh, your experience in the <b>wind</b> tunnel or seeing how they developed stuff in the <b>wind</b> tunnel. And you, you basically came in contact with the <b>idea</b> of scaling, and there was a word you, you used that it was used in terms ... And I had forgotten the word about they were interested in scaling down ... They were interested in scaling up. Um, and there was a word that described that, an engineering term. Do you, do you <b>remember</b>?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Well, the, the dimensional analysis, they call it, and scaling and then there are some ... You can put together different factors, you know, how many feet per second you go and how many second for this or that. And if you juggle them so that this array of terms, all the dimensions cancel out, they call it dimensional, dimensionless number. And it just turns out in a funny way that, uh, if any other thing you make has the same, you know ... That that dimensionless number changes, that's what's going to give you in that scaling. But, but, um, it just, it just came into my mind of you can test this <b>lit</b>tle piece of a <b>wind</b> foil, air foil and a <b>wind</b> tunnel and translate that accurately to what it'll mean in the big <b>wind</b> tunnel which just changes, so.<br><br>John Markoff: Yeah. Okay, I'll come back to it, but I realize I interrupted you because you had a series of insights. One was that you needed a goal, [00:18:00] but there was another one.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah, the goal about (a) how, how does, how does your maximum ... How can you maximize the benefit your career will have to mankind? Which, uh, you know, how do these ... Not just as, as, a real sign of how na\u00efve country <b>boy</b>, things I've never quite gotten over (laughs), but, uh, uh, oh, well, what, what are some of the really big challenges mankind has that if you can really help that, you've really contributed.<br><br>\tAnd this got me into starting and looking in the library and things about big, tough, complex goals and such, you know, like, hey, the, the, uh, malaria problems in some tropical areas where you've got all places where everybody is so beat down by having malaria all the time. Oh, you could drain the swamps. Oh yes, but how do you get the money to do that? How do you coordinate it? Well, then if you drain the swamps, I realized one day the, you know, that, uh, they stopped being sick all the time. Well, the population will probably grow faster and exceed them ... sustenance capabi<b>lit</b>y of the land.<br><br>\tAnd, you know, it's just not simple, and that's what just dawned on me one Saturday, all these problems are very big. Oh, and they have to be dealt with collectively, and we're not getting smarter collectively enough to handle these big things. Oh, (clears <b>throat</b>). </div><div id='full_1'><mark>Oh, maybe ... Oh, and then suddenly, the <b>idea</b> of a computer and the electronics that I had learned with <b>radar</b> and sonar of screens, how electronics can make things draw on the screen, and in fact how the electronics in a <b>radar</b> can respond to the use ... the operator.</mark></div><div><br><br>\tOh, well, if a computer, all they knew about it is they can punch cards or print on paper, well, then, certainly I just knew instinctively you can make electronics to put anything you want on a screen. And if they can [00:20:00] read punched cards, they can certainly read what a human does and it just, you know, I just knew instinctively that you could make it so you could interact with one, and somehow that just came to a picture of, <b>boy</b>, that's what I could go after.<br><br>John Markoff: And did you frame it with the <b>idea</b> of augmentation at that point? That, that ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: No, it took, it took years to, uh ...<br><br>John Markoff: So the <b>idea</b> was there, but to actually get the structure.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Well, it was going to augment. It was going to be able to do these things and like, oh, and the same computer complex, you could tie a number of these, uh, dem- ... workstations together and you could collaborate, and, uh, oh <b>boy</b>, let's just go. And then, then I realized it would be handy to have some research, you know, talents or training. And, well, I should go to graduate school, and, uh, the Berkeley had a research project that they were building an experimental computer, uh ...<br><br>John Markoff: But it was, it was ... You already had the <b>idea</b> of the system you want to build and so you needed skills and that you knew that they were working on a computer project and that was ... became the place to go to ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah. That plus how do you do research? You know, the whole thing about equipping yourself to be able to be qualified to do the kind of research.<br><br>John Markoff: Um, you ... Tell me about meeting Ballard. Um, your ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: She was a girl that (laughs) ...<br><br>John Markoff: But you ... I <b>remember</b>, uh, you told me at one point that when you were at Ames, a lot of times, you would just go over and hang out at the library at Stanford. You weren't a real social <b>guy</b>. Um, probably the stacks at Stanford libraries were not the best place to meet young women.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah. Well, I, I was ... Got to thinking I'd like to meet women. I, I, I had an interest in, uh, soaring, soaring planes. So I started going with a group and meeting with [00:22:00] them that were learning how to do that. And then one day, I suddenly realized there's nothing but men in here. (laughs) So then I, I asked the <b>guy</b>s at, at work, well, where do you go to meet girls? Well, see, they were ... Most of them are married. They didn't have all that many <b>idea</b>s, except one of them mentioned that well, he, here's that ... In the Palo Alto City Center, they have, uh, folk dancing classes. Oh, and I just pictured something that turned off, so.<br><br>\tBut anyway, I went over there one evening and stood there and watched an intermediate class and it just intrigued the hell ... I, I was very clumsy and bashful and I, I couldn't do ballroom dancing effectively with just a [serial 00:22:44] sweat. But I watched what all these people were doing. Oh, <b>boy</b>. And so even though they were in an intermediate class, at the next break, I scooted out there and grabbed a woman who was started ... Well, I, I had never done anything like that (laughs). So I began to be a regular at that, and, and, uh, that's where I met Ballard and [<b>crosstalk</b> 00:23:05].<br><br>John Markoff: That's right. So you, you moved to Berkeley. Um, you got a PhD in electrical engineering?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah.<br><br>John Markoff: Okay. But it was basically, um, the design and, and research leading to com- ... computer systems.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: You could take the computer option of doing research and talking about that and, um, and I happen to <b>remember</b> some strange bistable phenomena in gaseous discharges like neon tube or something that you could install ... You put a radio wave, radio wave, cross it like this and, uh, and that's the way we would tune the transmitters. You know, the brighter that light ... You hold that up near the antenna and the ... As you adjust the power level, the brighter it got, the more power out there. Then, I noticed one day that also [00:24:00] as you backed it down, it would stay <b>lit</b> at a lower, uh, voltage level than it took to get it going. Oh, you know, at that intermediate stage if it were <b>lit</b>, it would stay <b>lit</b>. If it weren't, it wouldn't get <b>lit</b>.<br><br>\tAnd so I thought, well, that would be an interesting thing in the computer world of another bistable sort of phenomenon. And so I built shift registers of <b>lit</b>tle, <b>lit</b>tle patterns of glow, no-glow, would just shift around that tube. But it's far too clumsy and slow for (laughs).<br><br>John Markoff: [<b>crosstalk</b> 00:24:35] Um, and yet it led you to your ... Didn't it lead you to your first sort of business venture?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah.<br><br>John Markoff: So you, you were an entrepreneur. That was sort of a sidetrack but yet, you, you wanted to do something with the technology. Was that ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Well, it turned out there were some fast-talking patent attorney that I <b>happened</b> to bump in when I was at school or like that and said, \u201cHey, you could get these things patented.\u201d So 13 or 14 patents came out of this. You know, you can almost build a whole computer with these <b>lit</b>tle gaseous plasma things. Um, but it, it just ... You know, then there was the chance. He said, \u201cYou know, you could actually start a business and have this goal. And one thing you could do is make very interesting kind of signs for people because they could have these neon tubes around like that and the <b>lit</b>tle glow-no patterns would move around them so you could have just very interesting things.\u201d So, okay, but I was ... I, I wasn't destined to be a businessman or something, so the [packers 00:25:44] we had pulled out after about four, five months, and ...<br><br>John Markoff: Yeah. There were some San Francisco store owners, weren't they, who ultimately invested in the project? Wasn't it one of the retail stores in San Francisco? The, the family?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah. I can't <b>remember</b> now.<br><br>John Markoff: But it, [00:26:00] it went nowhere. When it didn't work out, what did you decide to do next?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Oh, then I, then I decided I really liked to get in just doing some real research and get going after the computer things I wanted. And so, uh, um, I had, I had been doing this while I was still teaching. I was an acting assistant professor at Berkeley after I got my degree for two years and, um, so something that <b>happened</b> in that environment too was very telling. Um, because Ballard and I continued folk dancing and, and we're getting acquainted with university people, and one time there was a party one Saturday that, uh, one of the <b>guy</b>s, friends of ours, he was an as- ... an associate professor in economics or something, but just very nice people.<br><br>\tSo after the party, I was helping him clean up and he <b>happened</b> to say, \u201cWell, what's your special interest, Doug?\u201d You know, because if you're in that university position, this is what you have to be doing, and I started telling him and he slowed down his work and finally looked at me and says, \u201cWell, um, you are aware, aren't you, of how promotion is handled in universities?\u201d Na\u00efve country kid shines through again and says, \u201cWell, um, no, not really.\u201d (laughs) Uh, so he explains to me about peer review and that you get promoted by writing papers that get submitted and accepted in the best journals. And the peer review decides, you know, your peers review it and that decides what gets in. He says, \u201cSo I can tell you right now. If you keep talking like you are now, you'll be an acting assistant professor forever.\u201d<br><br>John Markoff: (laughs)<br><br>Doug Engelbart: And, uh, I, I just really ... Suddenly, I got it. But the funny thing is then I thought ... [00:28:00] We thought of coming down the univers- ... Uh, Peninsula to get some jobs. Well, there was no Silicon Valley, but there was a Hewlett-Packard, and, uh, we had used their test equipment in the, in the Navy, so I knew about their story. So I went there and, oh, these interesting things I had done for my thesis work intrigued them and such. So, <b>boy</b>, he offered me a job in the research and, uh ...<br><br>John Markoff: Now, you, you met with both Hewlett and Packard. It was a small enough group that it was, it was David Packard who offered you the job, wasn't it?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: No, the, the head of research.<br><br>John Markoff: Oh, that's right. Um ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Barney Oliver.<br><br>John Markoff: Barney Oliver. But at some point, you had discussions with Packard.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah.<br><br>John Markoff: Yeah. And I <b>remember</b> Packard said ... </div><div id='full_3'><mark>Didn't Packard tell you, \u201cYou could keep the technology that you\u201d ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: This ... What just <b>happened</b>, he was such a straightforward <b>guy</b>.</mark></div><div> I just <b>happened</b> to say, \u201cWell, I've got this problem. There are quite a few different IT inventions I've had for my thesis work that I haven't patented yet and ... But I know when I go to work for you, I've got to sign over all the patents. So what do I do about that?\u201d He came out just instantly with thing, \u201cWell, I'll tell you. How about this? For the first six months, everything you can write disclosures on will be yours, no matter whether you thought of them at our place or before. After six months, they'll be ours, whether you thought about them before or after.\u201d And that just impressed me so much, just the honest, straightforward kind of way to do it. I just never forgot that, and, uh ...<br><br>John Markoff: So they offered you a job.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah.<br><br>John Markoff: Uh, and you didn't take it.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah, because ...<br><br>John Markoff: Tell me. Tell me what <b>happened</b>.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Well, I was driving home then all excited and by the time I got up here by Redwood City or something, I thought, \u201cOh. Wait a minute.\u201d And I stopped and called Barney Oliver up and I said, \u201cOh. Um, I forgot to check on something that I'm totally committed to working with computers and so I'm assuming you <b>guy</b>s will get to be working with them soon, so I just wanted to check on that.\u201d And so it's just [00:30:00] maybe a check. And he said, \u201cOh, sorry, Doug. Not a chance.\u201d And, uh, so I said, \u201cOkay. I guess that closes off our deal.\u201d<br><br>John Markoff: Yeah. What was the next step? So you, you were still looking ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: [<b>crosstalk</b> 00:30:14] I tried Stanford and wrote them a letter telling how I could ... I knew how to, uh, conduct laboratory and some classes and basic digital technique and learning and such. And, uh, the dean of engineering who was a very good <b>guy</b> and such wrote back a letter saying, \u201cWell, thank you for your interest in Stanford, but I must say we're a very small university and we have to specialize in highly academic topics, etc. for our research world. And, uh, since computers are only a service activity, we don't contemplate ever having computer classes and design classes or whatever.\u201d And, uh ...<br><br>John Markoff: Do you <b>remember</b> if that was Terman or Linvill? Do either of those names ring a bell?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Oh, sure. Uh, they both ring a bell, but that wasn't ...<br><br>John Markoff: Either?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Uh ...<br><br>John Markoff: Okay. So, so Stanford wasn't going to be a computer, um, research organization any time soon.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Either. Yeah, like, like Berkeley.<br><br>John Markoff: So where did you turn next?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: So then I went to Stanford Research Institute which later changed its name to SRI International. And they, they had the job at that time of actually developing a computer for the Bank of America's use, and, um ... But it was ... So that sound promising, but, uh, again, this time, uh, I happen to ... The first one I talked to at SRI was somebody who left Berkeley before I had by a couple of years, and he never found out what my driving interest was, and, uh, so he, he asked me. \u201cWell, I guess I've never found out.\u201d<br><br>\tAnd I started telling him that he went, he started looking in shock and he says, \u201cHave you talked to anybody else?\u201d \u201cNo, you're the first one.\u201d \u201cWell, I advise you. Don't just tell them about your [00:32:00] patents and your research and don't talk about that computer stuff because, uh, that'll turn, turn people off. And then you get hired. You get to be here and have a chance sometime to get the support.\u201d<br><br>John Markoff: Yeah. So they did offer you a job and it was with which group?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: That wasn't with a group. It was just plunking at a laboratory (clears <b>throat</b>) and sort of like then you scout around to see, uh, who would be interesting ... you know, who would interested and interesting. And, uh, so I, I ... They, they weren't interested in the, in the ... Building the computer for the Bank of America didn't really appeal to me, but, uh, then I met Hugh Crane and his magnetic logic things.<br><br>John Markoff: So this was a group funded by the Pentagon. They were hopeful about, uh, the development of magnetic logic technology for whatever reason, mi<b>lit</b>ary reasons or ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: (coughs) I am not sure who funded them because this was considerably before, uh, what's now the Information Processing Techniques Office got established in ARPA. And, uh ...<br><br>John Markoff: Okay. But these could be the building blocks. These could have been the building blocks for computers of the future. That was one of the <b>idea</b>s possibly.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah.<br><br>John Markoff: Okay. Yeah.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: But they, they'd be quite slow and, um, so I helped with that and then ...<br><br>John Markoff: You developed some, some innovative magnetic, um, devices, right, at, at this group? Um, switches or ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Well, the first thing they're having were just shift registers. You could shift bits down a long chain, you know, whole pattern and, um, and they were multi-aperture devices, uh, a large toroid with small holes, [00:34:00] you know, bump around the small hole in the ... It case it goes around.<br><br>John Markoff: Yeah.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: And it turned out that you could put current through there. It would lock, lock out the magnetism that would go around and, and, uh, then if you pulse that hard when the rest of it collapsed, that would make enough of the signal to transmit it to the next one, thing of this sort. And, uh ...<br><br>John Markoff: It was while you were working with this group that you went to Philadelphia to, uh, a meeting of, um, the International Circuits Conference. You traveled with Hugh Crane. This must have been 1960 perhaps, to give a paper about the <b>idea</b> of, um, I think it was called simi<b>lit</b>ude. And it was about scaling. It was ... You were putting some <b>idea</b>s together, <b>idea</b>s that you had ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Well, when, when I was going around doing that, I came to SRI in 1957 and, uh, so I was kind of hoping there'd be a chance to get into something with more active computer things. But one day I <b>happened</b> to be talking to a, a program manager, research manager, uh, in the Air Force and, uh, I just <b>happened</b> to tell him about the interest I had gotten about the simi<b>lit</b>ude, this scaling issue about airplanes and that, uh, uh, it'd be very interesting to study that for electronic components too because, you know, if you just make things smaller and smaller, they just naturally get faster.<br><br>\tSo I got a grant to do that, so, uh, then I, I did enough in that to kind of find much better ways to explain it and, um, why a device that this size would probably stop working if you make it 1/10th the size. [00:36:00] And, um, that's generally because some of the phenomena that you're harnessing in there are affected directly by the linear measure of something. Others are affected by the area and others by the volume. Of course all those change, they, they don't change at the same way as it's changed the scale. And so, uh, a phenomena that worked together this size would stop being able to latch together in this, but new phenomena could be found.<br>\tAnd, um, so I just thought, \u201cOh, that's terrific because knowing that, that, uh, the, the speed increases as well as the density of the things like that. So <b>boy</b>,\u201d I just said, \u201cThat, that's extremely important for the computer world because if we're talking about things I'm hoping for, it's got to be able to get faster and more, more powerful computers.\u201d<br><br>John Markoff: So you had proved to yourself that there was going to be enough computing power to build the kind of machine that you wanted to build.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: It just seemed inevitable right now.<br><br>John Markoff: Yeah. So you stumbled across the thing that would become known in 1965 or much later but you, you stumbled across Moore's Law or the, the, the scaling process.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Well, yeah, not the law about how much it's going to change, but yeah.<br><br>John Markoff: The, the underlying phenomenon that would be codified by the industry. Um, so who at SRI sort of, uh ... Did you ... You bumped into who let you begin to work on building a machine to augment human intelligence? Who? Wa- ... Was it outside or was it inside SRI that you got the ori- ... the original support?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Oh, outside. (laughs)<br><br>John Markoff: Okay. But Charlie Rosen was sympathetic to your <b>idea</b>s, wasn't he? I mean he, he was helpful, I, I think, I <b>remember</b> ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Oh yeah. Yeah.<br><br>John Markoff: In terms of funding or ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Well, just, just encouragement.<br><br>John Markoff: Yeah.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: He couldn't give me any funds or something.<br><br>John Markoff: Yeah. It was ... Was it the Air Force first who was your first funder?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah. Um, it was called Air Force Office of Scientific Research, [00:38:00] just, uh, sort of one-man ... or four-person office. Uh, and, uh, it just, it just <b>happened</b> that, uh, he was a wild-eyed enough character that he thought, \u201cWell.\u201d I, I just said, \u201cI, I want to write a study about what's the chances of ... and what's the payoff potential for interactive use of computers? And, uh, so he, he gave me some money to do this study, enough so I could just start sitting down and, and working and, uh ...<br><br>John Markoff: No computer though. You were, you were working entirely with <b>idea</b>s.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Oh, there was ... Weren't computers available. That's ... Um, anytime. Anyway, so I was just stubborn enough that that's what I'm going to do and even when the ... that kind of money didn't quite reach what it would take to support me fulltime, the institute had what they called the internal R&D where they would use overhead money to sponsor something that would hope to develop into a prog- ... funded program. And, um, so I kept plugging away and, uh ...<br><br>John Markoff: You wrote some papers.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah. And, uh, and, um, I wrote one about scaling before that on that other one. Uh, and so I ended up with this one sizeable report after about a year and a half or more. So in the fall of 1962, there was a quite large report. It was called Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework. And, uh, just hundreds and hundreds of hours of painful, trying to get ... carrying it through and such, [00:40:00] but, uh, out of that came a real, a real difference from the people whose terminology was oriented about automating our jobs, computer automating. And, uh, I said, \u201cWell, gee. It's more than that. It can change the way you work and think.\u201d<br><br>\tAnd so I pulled up this term, augmentation, and, uh, realizing how much else changes besides the artifacts we bring in. And, uh, I tried to explain to people. \u201cWell, do you think that, uh, elevators just automated everybody's abi<b>lit</b>y to get up to the top floor, seventh or eighth floor and that was all?\u201d No. Look what <b>happened</b> (clears <b>throat</b>). Buildings ... whew ... way up and then air-conditioning had to change, and, oh, population density or office business density. Well, that changes, you know, the commuting in and out had to change. Just huge amount of changes. And, uh ...<br><br>John Markoff: The <b>idea</b>s were there. Who gave you the money to actually begin to implement them with a computer?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Uh, the first, a <b>guy</b> who's now a historic figure, uh, he was, uh, an engineering-oriented <b>guy</b> from the MIT area and, uh, MIT and Harvard. And he had written a book called Man-Computer Symbiosis, a, a paper.<br><br>John Markoff: Uh-huh (affirmative).<br><br>Doug Engelbart: And, uh, so he was trying and ARPA brought him down to help set up the first Information Processing Techniques Office, so he set that up. And I was right there with proposals, so he ...<br><br>John Markoff: This was J.C.R. Licklider.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Right.<br><br>John Markoff: Yeah. And, uh, that allowed you to acquire an early small CDC machine. Was that your first?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: No. There were, [00:42:00] there were a sequence of different machines, but that one had a very small one, uh, but it turned out that, uh, you know, you know, even when I talked about <b>paradigm</b>, I haven't yet, but the <b>paradigm</b>s that made it hard for me to stay in university because who, who's going to work with computers interactively and so on like this? So the <b>paradigm</b> thing was just so prevalent and really impeded me immensely for decades.<br><br>John Markoff: Did you know at that time that you needed to break out of <b>paradigm</b>s to begin thinking of new <b>idea</b>s?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Oh yeah.<br><br>John Markoff: So that was part of the, the, this research struggle right from the start.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah. When doing that long study about augmenting human intellect, this, this came out quite clearly and, uh, and I found a book that described the name of what <b>paradigm</b>s were, etc. I can't <b>remember</b> the author. I'm sorry.<br><br>John Markoff: Yeah.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: It was very important. And, um ...<br><br>John Markoff: This wasn't The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. That came later, didn't it? That hadn't been written but when you were ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Uh, so anyway, the, the <b>paradigm</b>s that's sort of like this paper about augmenting human intellect just seems so outlandish or out of this world to the administrators at SRI that, uh, when the first money came to me to do that, they, uh, po<b>lit</b>ely told me that they'd promote me to be a senior research engineer and said I ought to write more things like this, and they put John in charge of the project because he was a computer programmer and knew how to do things like ...<br><br>John Markoff: John was one of the first people who worked for you or ... Who's ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: No. It, it ... [00:44:00] I, I was moved aside and if I ever tried to talk to them, I would get scolded. \u201cLeave them alone. John knows what he's doing.\u201d I would just ... It was just a, a parody on ...<br><br>John Markoff: So how did you get out of that?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Well, that went (laughs) and Licklider came to, to visit. I was, I was so na\u00efve I didn't think of complaining to him or something about what <b>happened</b>. Uh, and I ... You know, for years, I still am too na\u00efve about the po<b>lit</b>ics of all sorts of organizational environments and, uh.<br><br>John Markoff: Did Licklider introduce Taylor to you or did Taylor find his way to you in ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: I found Taylor. He was working for NASA.<br><br>John Markoff: That's right.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: And then told him about ARPA and Licklider and, uh, so then he went over there later but, uh ... Anyway, when Lick found out, you know, he sort of closed down that, that project and it wasn't until another time, it was too small a computer that we had to ... It was ... We are like the client that would work with a time-sharing computer which was under development down in Southern California (laughs).<br><br>John Markoff: But this was ... You had ... That was where you started the online system. Uh, you were doing the original development down in ... The programming was being done down in Southern California because that's where the computer was.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Well, we could program and [<b>crosstalk</b> 00:45:31] like that. But, but that thing just ... That computer was never work- ... would ... was always crashing (laughs), so that one didn't work. And, uh, then we got, uh, then we got a, another one that was big enough to start doing it, and that's the one where we put the display on it and, uh, I got the money to do a research project on trying to test the different kind of display selection devices, [00:46:00] and that's when I came up with the <b>idea</b> of the mouse, which got added into the other devices we were testing.<br><br>John Markoff: And this was \u201863, \u201864?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah, late \u201862 and \u201863.<br><br>John Markoff: Yeah. So it was ... What drove you to the mouse was how to interact with the display.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah. </div><div id='full_4'><mark>It was just while we were getting the different devices and then I happen to <b>remember</b> sketching up some <b>idea</b>s like that that was the first mouse and, and, uh, Bill English was setting up the engineering for this.</mark></div><div> And we had to make our own computer display. You couldn't buy them and, uh, I think it cost us $90,000 in 1963 money.<br><br>John Markoff: Did the technology come from the <b>radar</b> world? Where did you get the components to build it?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Well, people had been talking about doing that, so we just had to build it from scratch.<br><br>John Markoff: Yeah.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Uh, and the way it, way it was, is it would move, move the curs- ... move, move the beam and write the characters. It wasn't nearly enough storage capacity to have pixel.<br><br>John Markoff: So you built ... And you had at that point, were you developing your own character generators as well?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah.<br><br>John Markoff: That was the architecture.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: The writing of that. So that took a, a hunk of electronics that was about, you know, a table this size and about six feet by four feet ... or three feet by four feet full of electronics that was a display driver (laughs). And, uh, so then the computer display, it looked pretty good.<br><br>John Markoff: And I've seen the pictures. It wasn't square. Your first display I believe was a, wasn't it a round screen? Didn't you ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Oh, oh, sure.<br><br>John Markoff: Yeah, because they weren't square screens.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Right.<br><br>John Markoff: Yeah. (laughs) You told me once that ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: But anyway, that's what we then had available to use ...<br><br>Speaker 3:\tHang on a second, <b>guy</b>s. One second.<br><br>Speaker 4:\t[00:48:00] Uh, Doug, you're playing with the microphone again.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Oh.<br><br>Speaker 4:\t[<b>crosstalk</b> 00:48:05] The cord.<br><br>Speaker 3:\tJust be careful at the top.<br><br>Speaker 4:\tYeah, just be, just be careful. It, it was thumping into the audio, so. (laughs)<br><br>Doug Engelbart: (laughs)<br><br>John Markoff: Okay. Shall we start again?<br><br>Speaker 3:\tYeah.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Is this too much detail?<br><br>John Markoff: No, this is great. This is, this is ... I want to get all the detail I can. So don't worry. I'll, I'll ... Um, you told me once about the, the, sort of the thought process that you led directly to the mouse. You were at a meeting, and I think you said you were a <b>lit</b>tle bored and so you were just sort of daydreaming?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: That's the second stage. The first stage was years before when I was a senior in college and, uh, uh, I took the power option instead of the electronic option because I had a lot of electronics (laughs). And so we were doing these tests on big, heavy generators and everything like this, and, uh, then you have to plot the data and then there's some point in there in which the data plot makes a closed loop and you have to figure out what the area under is. So there's a device that you get that's ... It planks down solid and it's an elbow like thing with a pointer at the end. And, uh, a <b>lit</b>tle round sharp-edge wheel like that and another one at the elbow. And when you go around this thing, the change in how much those wheels turn, uh, you can use those to calculate what the area of ... No matter what the, the shape was.<br><br>John Markoff: Right.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: And I asked the, the, the instructor, \u201cWell, how does that work?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, all I know is that those wheels like that, if you had access like that, they'll only roll along this direction no matter what. If they do like this, they'll only roll as far as you went in that direction.\u201d And, uh, so it was during some kind of a conference in which I was bored that I thought of that and got my <b>lit</b>tle notebook and says, oh, you know, if you put two of them together like this, one would be telling you how far this way and the other this way. And that's all ...<br><br>John Markoff: To capture the movement of the XY axis. [00:50:00] So you just compressed that into a box basically, and that's the computer mouse.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Right.<br><br>John Markoff: That's great. So ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: So Bill, I told him to sketch that for him and he built the first one.<br><br>John Markoff: You went to the machine shop and they built a, a wooden box.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Oh, no, this was ...<br><br>John Markoff: Even before?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: It got ... Well, it, uh, you design it so somebody has to do mechanical design drawings to tell a machine shop what to do. So there's a mechanical draftsman kid that was doing that. And, uh, he <b>happened</b> to say, \u201cOh, I'm a, a, I'm a ... My hobby is wood, wood carving. I can make a case over it.\u201d So that's how that got there. And, uh, all we were doing is testing the select so one button, red, and we didn't think about it but the cord came out this tail end so sitting there. And somebody ... And we still don't know who among the five or six people involved in designing and building and setting up the experiments, etc. and tests and training the subjects and so on, somebody in there started calling it a mouse because I don't think about giving names to things like that. And, uh ... But, uh, so this is ... So no one, no one knows. So it's ...<br><br>John Markoff: Lost in history.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah, lost in history.<br><br>John Markoff: And, um, the first one had one button, the very first one you built. But what, what was the right number of buttons? Did, did you think about how many buttons you wanted after you built the first one?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah, right.<br><br>John Markoff: And what, what was your thought process?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Well, all we could get on. I could only get three in there the way it was designed, so that's (laughs).<br><br>John Markoff: More would have been better if you could've ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah.<br><br>John Markoff: Yeah.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Because, uh, I don't know how Steve Jobs says one button or something like that, but you've got lots of action here that you can do, and, uh, that ... It just seems silly of me not to use that.<br><br>John Markoff: So if you could be more [00:52:00] powerful, if you could have more power in the hand, that would be, that would be <b>idea</b>l.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Well, this is, this sort of ... And it gets into that <b>paradigm</b> situation again of, of, you know, what's easy to learn? See? Versus what are you capable of doing? And you could learn. When you learn, it'll be easy. And if, if you just realize how many things you do that, that when you're born aren't conditioned into that ... You know, just all kinds of skills that ... Take for granted.<br><br>John Markoff: Yeah.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: And, well, typing ...<br><br>John Markoff: Yeah.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: ... and things. So, so I would just saying, sure, this opens up the interface at something in which we're exploring capabi<b>lit</b>y and, uh, let's go after capabi<b>lit</b>y. And this, I was just sure that every knowledge worker in the future was going to be working this way. And, uh, well, we can talk about that.<br><br>John Markoff: Well, but you ... There are a whole bunch of <b>lit</b>tle pieces here, big pieces. Um, another device you developed was a chord key, keyboard. Um, it turned out not to be a success in terms of acceptance in the bigger market but it was a way that you were experimenting with breaking down <b>paradigm</b>s.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Well, it's just a way to improve capabi<b>lit</b>y because if you're using the mouse, you can't type and, uh, so that leads to the thing of all the point and click, uh, uh, uh. And to me, that was like pigeon English, you know, uh, ooh. And, uh, so the actually command language we developed was just saying I wanted the ... We've got a bunch of verbs. You want actions you want to do on a bunch of different kind of objects, what then ... designated by nouns.<br><br>John Markoff: Right.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: So we, we had that and then with the absolute minimum number of keystrokes to set up any command, like just D-W [00:54:00] would flash up delete word. So you hit D-W, click, click, the word is gone. C-W, I want to copy the word. Click, click, it gets copied. Replace the word ... or a whole paragraph, a sentence, just all kinds of things. Visible string just meant, you know, it would be a word plus any punctuation or something. So we ended up with many verbs and many nouns that, uh, if somebody came and looked at that, oh. But it's just like you're learning an extension to your natural language if you come in to some new kind of environment. Uh ...<br><br>John Markoff: By this time, you had begun to build the online system.<br><br>Speaker 3:\tOne second. We need to change [production talk 00:54:46].<br><br>John Markoff: Sure. Got you.<br><br>Speaker 3:\tGood. [production talk 00:54:50]<br><br>John Markoff: Yeah.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: That's a par- ... <b>paradigm</b> issues we had ... I, I, um ... Somebody. Let's see. About the time where, where you did your mouse thing at Xerox PARC and that, uh, I was at the history museum for some reception they had. And I met a <b>guy</b> who worked at the, at National Science Foundation. And I didn't know him. I just got to talking and found out he did. And, uh, so I said, \u201cWell, I wonder. You know, I'm not in university and I'm pretty old.\u201d<br><br>Speaker 3:\t[production talk 00:55:43]<br><br>Doug Engelbart: I got to talking with him. So, uh, he called me up later and invited me to come at the end of the month to talk to the staff at NSF.<br><br>John Markoff: Did you do that recently?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Just the end of this month.<br><br>John Markoff: [00:56:00] Oh, you just, you just went?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: No.<br><br>John Markoff: Oh, you're just going?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: No. You know, at the end of August.<br><br>John Markoff: Oh, okay. Oh, great. Well, that's good.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah. So it's just like, hey, [<b>crosstalk</b> 00:56:07].<br><br>John Markoff: Excellent.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: And so a big thing I want to get to them, a lot of examples of the <b>paradigm</b> issue.<br><br>John Markoff: Yeah. So, um, where did the <b>idea</b> of bootstrapping come from? As part of the augment system, the <b>idea</b> of being able to, to sort of build the system and then build on top of the system and then continue that process. Where did that <b>idea</b> come from?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: It, it came out of the ... Two things, that the model of how we augment ourselves. We already are augmented, and it's a huge amount of things more than just the artifacts we employ, all the skills and the methods and the language and customs and the organizational structures and all, all kinds of things that are like this that they all ... The artifacts are just integrated in. And there's no way you're going to make some huge change in the capabi<b>lit</b>y of an organization by just plugging in some new line of art- ... artifacts. And so that, that just got to the point of saying, oh, the only way you're going to do it is by helping faci<b>lit</b>ate the evolution of that whole thing.<br><br>John Markoff: And was that approach sort of, uh, in process in the first half of the \u201860s as you sort of ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: That's ...<br><br>John Markoff: It was clear in your mind that that's the way you would evolve the system.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Right. And then, then in the early \u201870, what I need ... You need to get real people, not just the research kind of <b>guy</b>, the real people involved. So we set up an arrangement and DARPA let us ... ARPA let us go ahead and, uh, start selling NLS usage as service over the ARPANET.<br><br>John Markoff: Right.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: And, uh, this was going out great. We actually had the way to, to cultivate their usage and start helping faci<b>lit</b>ate their evolution, and what they need [00:58:00] is the way it changes the tools, etc. and ...<br><br>John Markoff: But before you did that, you built this system. You had a display, a computing device, a storage device, a sophisticated software system that allowed you to do, uh, text editing and hypertext. You had all of the ingredients of modern personal computing. Um, you showed it to the world for the first time really in 1969.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: \u201868.<br><br>John Markoff: Was it December of \u201868?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah.<br><br>John Markoff: It was, it was at Brooks Hall in San Francisco. It probably is the most famous computer demonstration in history. How did it happen? What led to the demonstration?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Well, it's, uh, this, our NLS system was getting more and more interesting and useful, and, uh, it just occurred to me it still is very hard to tell any of the colleagues out in the world that we're computer-oriented people what we were doing and why. And so it'll be great instead of just giving a paper at a conference is to demo it. And we had the kind of tech- ... technology on hand that could do that. Uh, because I, I found out that the telephone company was actually in the business that they would lease, set up and lease for you video line links. So we had two, two links, one-way links going from San ... from SRI up to the city. And, uh, then we had to build a modem ...<br><br>John Markoff: To carry the data.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: To ... So that we could run it from the city. And you couldn't buy a modem, so Bill English and Jeff Rulifson put together a modem. And, uh, uh, then Bill English had <b>happened</b> to ... have been very active, he and his wife, in amateur theater and so he knew how you had to direct and run things. And, uh, so he, he not only arranged for the communication up there [01:00:00] and all this, but then he built a, uh, a platform about this high, uh, that was covered with canvass where he sat there with the two feeds coming up like this, but also then the feed that would go up to the projector and ...<br><br>John Markoff: The projector was just a remarkable device. I mean it was ... The screen was huge by, by ... The only way they can make screens in those days of that size was with film, but you were doing video projection.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Well, we just <b>happened</b> to stumble some months before that because we never could have done it without that and something ... I think it was called an Eidophor.<br><br>John Markoff: An Eidophor projector.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Right. And it ... The phenomena by which it made ... That modified the light, it sort of had a mirror that was coated ... A mirror surface was thin film of mercury, and it was in a vacuum, and the electron beam could go there like this. It turns out that that charged density on the surface of the mercury would deform it a <b>lit</b>tle bit like this, and that was all it took to bend the light as it come down and it would then go through a grading so that which was bent would be darker at that point and stuff like this. But it was just a magic thing. It was something by six-foot high and three by two feet or something like this, on wheels.<br><br>John Markoff: With an arc light as its light source, right? That really bright arc light source.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah.<br><br>John Markoff: Yeah.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: So, uh ...<br><br>John Markoff: So you sat up on stage. You had the keyboard, the chord key set.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: And the mouse in it. And, uh, it was all on a kind of molded, uh, thing fit on a chair with a swivel that it turned out that Herman Miller furniture company, uh, the designer there got really interested in what we did, so they built those chairs for us. (laughs)<br><br>John Markoff: You know, I talked to them about it about two months ago. They're still very proud of the fact that they helped you.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Oh, really?<br><br>John Markoff: Yes. And they have pictures. I should send you the picture. I have a [01:02:00] picture of you consulting with a Herman Miller person about the design of ... That they still have in their archives.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Oh, that's terrific.<br><br>John Markoff: I'll send it to you. But anyway.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Oh yeah, that was, that was really something. So, uh, anyway, then, then Bill English also had an audio line going back down to the peninsula and, uh, and he'd be telling people ... I wrote the script, script for it all and that, and that included people from the lab tying in and doing things, and Bill was ... Then, we had volunteer people with ... We borrowed the video cameras that made the (laughs) ... Generated the displays for our people (laughs). They were very great fix-up, but, uh, the ... So it was just so much leverage temporary put together things that it could have crumbled during the time.<br><br>John Markoff: You had an audience of about a thousand.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: I don't know <b>lit</b>erally how many.<br><br>John Markoff: Some of the best computer scientists in the country. People before that didn't think of computing as interactive, and you showed them ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Well, if they did, they, they had a very different <b>idea</b> from what I had done. And, uh ...<br><br>John Markoff: This was really the first public demonstration of the kind of interactive computing that we all take for granted now.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah. And, and more that we're doing things there that just totally got cut away because they didn't have <b>paradigm</b>s.<br><br>John Markoff: Yeah.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: You know, while we had hyperlinks going but hyperlinks, all kinds of ... between everything and everything. You could link to anything.<br><br>John Markoff: Yeah.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: And the hyperlinks that we ... Now also all kind of optional viewing. So one thing is wide view and I clip paragraphs so I only show the first three lines for instance. And so on the next line would be the, the long, ugly link kind of thing. You wouldn't see that. So if you said jump the link, the system would go looking [01:04:00] downstream for the link and take it. So that's how we changed. Almost every scene was just jumping on links around inside that and with different views, and we had graphics working at the time, you know, can make that map for instance of, you know, how I'm going to get home this evening (laughs) after all the shopping for my wife. And, uh, so ...<br><br>John Markoff: What do you <b>remember</b> about the, uh, the audience reaction when you finished your demonstration?<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Well, uh, during the demo, the lights in my eyes were so bright I couldn't see the audience. I just had to know they're there. And so when all got done, I, phew, <b>boy</b>. So I was unstrapping myself and getting up and the lights went out and I saw everybody was standing up, applauding wildly, and I thought, oh, phew, just feeling so lucky that we got through without crashing.<br><br>John Markoff: (laughs)<br><br>Doug Engelbart: And, uh ...<br><br>John Markoff: That's neat.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: But, but it was a strange thing. There was a lot of excitement, and the next day, you know, we had the stuff on another room and people could come and see and we could show them ...<br><br>John Markoff: Yeah.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: ... the live demos. But, uh, it's just like, oh, all that excitement. After that, it's just like nothing <b>happened</b> in the world.<br><br>John Markoff: Well, let's, let's, let's talk about that a <b>lit</b>tle bit, because, you know, in a way, let's talk about the future and sort of what got lost and what still needs to be done. Um, so there were some <b>idea</b>s that got taken away and they turned into commercial products, whole industries, but I think I've come to understand your feeling is that something didn't get taken away.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Oh, <b>boy</b>.<br><br>John Markoff: And tell me about what still needs to be done.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Well, I think the focus needs to be on capabi<b>lit</b>ies that you can derive and take the business of, uh, cost of learning and set it aside until you assess the values [01:06:00] of the higher capabi<b>lit</b>ies you can go after. Whereas it, it seemed like there was some level like this, I don't know how it got set that early \u201870s, just got to be easy to learn, and, uh, with all due respect to all the human computer interface <b>guy</b>s, that just to me has just been a deno- ... Uh, I point out to people. </div><div id='full_2'><mark>Hey, we'd all be still be riding tricycles if that's ...<br><br>John Markoff: [<b>crosstalk</b> 01:06:22] big adult <b>guy</b> in a tricycle or your other interesting way of getting this <b>idea</b> is about taking a pencil and attaching a brick to it.</mark></div><div><br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah.<br><br>John Markoff: And how ineffective it is with the brick on the end of it.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Right.<br><br>John Markoff: So your argument is this original <b>idea</b> you had about machines that augment human intelligence, we got trapped on the curve somewhere and it flattened out.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: It was somehow the automation <b>idea</b> got in there and then during the early years, it was office automation; the real user is the secretary. Therefore, you have to make it easy for her to learn, etc. And I kept trying to say, \u201cNo, the real user is tomorrow's knowledge worker.\u201d (laughs) You're a nice <b>guy</b>, Doug, but, uh ...<br><br>John Markoff: So how do we get back on the curve? So I understand your principle. Um, you know, somehow we go off the curve. You think we could continue to build more powerful tools that would get us back on this ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Absolutely. And there's a ... A big part of that is, uh, the <b>paradigm</b>s about, hey, uh, one, one thing is the \u201cbook,\u201d book <b>paradigm</b> that that's just built into everybody's sort of parad- ... <b>paradigm</b>atic (laughs) outlook is. That's the way you read and study and you say, \u201cWell, no, wait. That's just the way an artifact that they call printing and such produce things that would help you do that.\u201d<br><br>John Markoff: Yeah.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: We've got brand-new set of artifacts now, so let's change our <b>paradigm</b>s. Let's say what we can do. And so that's what I started doing in the \u201860s. I'd say for one thing, [01:08:00] you don't want to be able to jump around. So not just a link pointing to another document, but I want to, I want to jump, oh, I want to jump ... There were just a huge number of jumps, you could just say what you wanted done. I want to jump to the next chapter. I want to jump back to the rig- ... origin. Oh, then you start saying the different views. You know, one line only. I want this.<br><br>\tAnd the optional views just kept growing and growing and the kind of moving around you could do ... get- ... getting more flexible because your jumping and viewing was, well, then, also, since you can address anything so flexibly for a jump, you can also address very flexibly for any editing you want to do. I want to move this chapter to follow this chapter in this other book. That's just one command: Move branch.<br><br>John Markoff: So the tools are, the tools are just ... They got stunted somewhere along the way. The, the original model was to have tools that people might ... It might be hard to learn, but once you learn them, you would be so much more powerful.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: That's right. To look at capabi<b>lit</b>ies, see, and so nobody ever did.<br><br>John Markoff: Yeah.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: They just, uh, uh, pooh-poohed it. Sort of like in that \u201868 thing, it, it ... A funny thing <b>happened</b> that early this summer, there was a, a European conference, computer-based conference, they called it Reboot, and it was trying to sort of restudy some of the older things that had done. And so for one thing, they got the 90-minute video. We happen to be lucky enough to record that \u201868 demo, and they showed the whole 90 minutes to everybody there. And all of the, the results that they had were just, uh, you know, just raving remarks of like, you know, we're still not able to do a lot of those things.<br><br>John Markoff: People are still surprised. Well, one of the things ... I, I, I didn't want to end without noting and asking you what your memories are. [01:10:00] You know, today's internet started with the ARPANET and the ARPANET started with two nodes, and one of them was at ... in Southern California, and the other one was at Menlo Park in the, in the Augment Project. So I think that's important, but what I think nobody knows is that, you know, the, the modern internet is built on these things called ref- ... request for proposals, the whole, the standards effort. And if you go back and you read RFP number one, um, the original ARPANET was built to make the use of NLS, the online system that you designed, uh, remote use of it possible.<br>\t<br>\tSo your NLS system was I, I think the first killer app ... It was supposed to be the first killer app for the ARPANET which became the internet. And do you, do you <b>remember</b> that discussion? What led to them wanting to, to use NLS in that way? Or to ... Was it the <b>idea</b> to make it more ...<br><br>Doug Engelbart: I don't think it was quite that direct. It was, uh, at the, at the event was a meeting of all the principle investigators ARPA had in the computer domain. I think it was the University of Michigan, I think. And, uh, that when Bob Taylor and Larry Roberts, the two <b>guy</b>s running that office, told us all that they were going to go ahead and put together this network on a brand-new mode of doing a network. And, uh, <b>boy</b>, I just right away thinking about the excitement about the collaboration you could do like this, but all they were talking about is sharing resources. If I have special data, you can get access to it. If you have special computer processes, I can send stuff there to get it done actually.<br>\t<br>\tAnd, uh, for me, I looked, hey, this is great, but there was a, an interaction that went on then. Two <b>guy</b>s sitting next to me, you know, big shots [01:12:00] and <b>lit</b>tle, small egos, of course, but, um, you know, so one of them turned to the other and says, \u201cWhat do you have in your computer that I could use?\u201d You know, it was, you know ... </div><div id='full_0'><mark>The other <b>guy</b>, you know, just as quick-witted said, \u201cWell, don't you read my reports?\u201d And this <b>guy</b> gets some ... And he gets back with a killer, \u201cWell, do you send them to me?\u201d Knowing that <b>guy</b> has no <b>idea</b> where his reports go.</mark></div><div> And they both realized that's never going to get any place, so they turned together to talk to Taylor and Roberts to say, \u201cWell, how are we going to know what's on everybody else's computer?\u201d And it just appeared right then that that hadn't really been thought through.<br>\t<br>\tWell, I had been sitting there, thinking, \u201cHey, that provides a tremendous way for communication and the whole thing.\u201d And so I volunteered to start a Network Information Center there and serve it, and that's, that's sort of why they put me ... my computer on early. And so that, that worked and ran for quite a few years.<br><br>John Markoff: And as it turned out, a couple of dec- ... decades later, it changed the world. This has been good. Thank you for the stories.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Oh, but ... (laughs)<br><br>John Markoff: We could, we could go on for the rest of the day.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah, right.<br><br>John Markoff: There, there are a lot of them. But thanks.<br><br>Doug Engelbart: Yeah, that's good.</div>",

Engelbart<br>The Bootstrap Alliance<br>April 23, 2002 (AUGMENT,133320,) <br><br>Keynote Address, World Library Summit, April 23 - 26, 2002, Singapore. <br>Republished for the IBM Co-Evolution Symposium September 24, 2003. (biblio-32).<br>Click here for print version (pdf.)<br>Summary. In the past <b>fifty</b> years we have seen enormous growth in computing cap<b>ability</b> - computing is everywhere and has impacted nearly everything. In this talk, Dr. Douglas Engelbart, who pioneered much of what we now take for granted as interactive computing, examines the forces that have shaped this growth. He argues that our criteria for <b>investment</b> in <b>innovation</b> are, in fact, short-sighted and focused on the wrong things. He proposes, instead, <b>investment</b> in an <b>improvement</b> <b>infrastructure</b> that can result in sustained, radical <b>innovation</b> capable of changing computing and expanding the kinds of problems that we can address through computing. In this talk, Dr. Engelbart describes both the processes that we need to put in place and the capabilities that we must support in order to stimulate this higher rate of <b>innovation</b>. The talk closes with a call to action for this World Library Summit audience, since this is a group that has both a stake in <b>innovation</b> and the <b>ability</b> to shape its direction.<br><br>GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS<br><br>The development of new computing technologies over the past <b>fifty</b> years - in hardware and software - has provided stunningly important changes in the way we work and in the way we <b>solve</b> problems.<br><br>I need to get this assertion out in front of you early in this talk, because most of the rest of what I have to say might cause you to think that I have lost track of this progress or that I don't appreciate it. So, let me get it said \u2013 we have made enormous strides since the early 1950s, when I first began thinking seriously about ways to use computers to address important social problems. It has truly been a remarkable <b>fifty</b> years.<br><br>At my first job at NACA, the forerunner of NASA, right out of engineering school, there was no vision at all of electronic computers. In fact the term \"computers\" referred to the room full of women sitting at desks using desk calculators to process the wind tunnel data. This was in the late 40's. After I'd earned my doctorate at UC Berkeley and worked there as an acting assistant professor, I applied to Stanford to help develop and teach computer design courses. They told me \"Since computing is only a service activity, we don't contemplate ever having courses in computer design be part of our academic program.\" When I was pursuing Federal funding for IT projects at SRI in the early 60's, there was some real question about whether there would be the programming talent to work on computing applications of this complexity in Palo Alto California. This certainly inhibited our chances for getting research support.<br><br>Later in my research, when I thought about using computers to manipulate symbols and language, rather than to do calculations on numbers, most people thought I was really pretty far gone. I was even advised to stay away from jobs in academia. It seemed clear to everyone else at the time that nobody would ever take seriously the idea of using computers in direct, immediate interaction with people. The idea of interactive computing - well, it seemed simply ludicrous to most sensible people.<br><br>So, we have made truly tremendous progress. We are able to <b>solve</b> problems, ranging from weather forecasting to <b>disaster</b> relief to creating new materials to even cracking the very genetic code that makes us humans - problems that we could not have even contemplated without the avail<b>ability</b> of cheap, widely available, highly functional computers and software. It has been a marvelous 50 years to be in this business.<br><br>But that is not what I am going to talk to you about. Not out of lack of appreciation - even a sense of wonder - over what computer technologists have developed - but because I can see that we are not yet really making good progress toward realizing the really substantial payoff that is possible. That payoff will come when we make better use of computers to bring communities of people together and to augment the very human skills that people bring to bear on difficult problems.<br><br>In this talk I want to talk to you about that big payoff, think a bit with you about what is getting in the way of our making better progress, and enlist you in an effort to redirect our focus. This audience is made up of the kinds of people who really can change the focus so that we can set at least of part of our development efforts on the right course.<br><br>The rewards of focusing on the right course are great. I hope to show you that they can be yours.<br><br>THE VISION: THE PAYOFF<br><br>Before talking and thinking with you about why we keep heading off in the wrong direction, I need to quickly sketch out what I see as the goal - the way to get the significant payoff from using computers to augment what people can do. This vision of success has not changed much for me over <b>fifty</b> years - it has gotten more precise and detailed - but it is pointed at the same potential that I saw in the early 1950s (ref. 1). It is based on a very simple idea, which is that when problems are really difficult and complex - problems like addressing hunger, containing terrorism, or helping an economy grow more quickly - the solutions come from the insights and capabilities of people working together. So, it is not the computer, working alone, that produces a solution. It is the combination of people, augmented by computers.<br><br>The key word here is \"augment.\" The reason I was interested in interactive computing, even before we knew what that might mean, arose from this conviction that we would be able to <b>solve</b> really difficult problems only through using computers to extend the cap<b>ability</b> of people to collect information, create knowledge, manipulate and share it, and then to put that knowledge to work. Just as the tractor extends the human's <b>ability</b> to work the earth, and planes extend our <b>ability</b> to move, so does the computer extend our <b>ability</b> to process and use knowledge. And that knowledge production is a group activity, not an individual one. Computers most radically and usefully extend our capabilities when they extend our <b>ability</b> to collaborate to <b>solve</b> problems beyond the compass of any single human mind..<br><br>I have found, over the years, that this idea of \"augmenting\" cap<b>ability</b> needs clarification for many people. It is useful to contrast \"augmentation\" with \"automation.\" Automation is what most people have in mind when they think about using computers. Automation is what is going on when we use computers to figure up and print telephone bills or to keep track of bank charges. It is also what is going on when we think about \"artificial intelligence.\" Even though printing up phone bills and AI seem very different, they both share this assumption that the computer stands over there, apart from the human, doing its thing. That is not, in my mind, how we use computers to <b>solve</b> tough problems.  We have the opportunity to harness their unique capabilities to provide us new and more effective ways to use our mind and senses - so that the computer truly becomes a way of extending our capabilities.<br><br>The shovel is a tool, and so is a bulldozer. Neither works on its own, \"automating\" the task of digging. But both tools augment our <b>ability</b> to dig. And the one that provides the greatest augmentation, not surprisingly, takes the most training and experience in order to use it really effectively.<br><br>For <b>fifty</b> years I have been working to build the computing equivalents of bulldozers. With the added constraint that, in serious knowledge works, it is almost always through the collaborative work of a team, rather than a lone operator, that we make progress.<br><br>Now, there is a lot more to say about this vision than that \u2013 and I will speak to some of it later in this talk. But, in starting our consideration of how to change course in order to get a bigger payoff from our <b>investment</b> in computing, this focus on augmenting the <b>ability</b> of groups to <b>solve</b> problems is the right starting point.<br><br>EVIDENCE OF TROUBLE<br><br>Because we are so accustomed to thinking in terms of the enormous progress and change surrounding computing, it is important to take at least a few moments to look at the evidence that, when it comes to these broader, social and group-centered dimensions of computing, the picture looks quite different.<br><br>\"Difficulty in doing important collaborative work. - As one example, my organization, the Bootstrap Alliance, works in loose collaboration with a number of other organizations to help them develop better ways to improve their <b>ability</b> to learn and to use knowledge - in short, we work with organizations to help them improve their <b>ability</b> to improve.<br>One organization that we work with is the Global Disaster Information Network - or \"GDIN\" - which is, itself, a consortium of regional and local <b>disaster</b> response organizations. Organizations that respond to <b>disaster</b>s are tremendous examples of organizations that must learn to adapt and use new information quickly. Disasters are, by their nature, unplanned and surprising. Responding requires rapid access to weather information, geographical and mapping information, information about local resources, local communications, the avail<b>ability</b> of outside resources and organizations - sometimes even about the location of buried mines and unexploded munitions. And, because <b>disaster</b> response involves so many people, from many organizations and jurisdictions, it is critically important to share all of this information about resources and capabilities, as well as information about response status, planned next steps, and so on.<br><br>Computers and, in particular, the Internet, clearly play a key role in the efforts to coordinate such <b>disaster</b> response and to improve the <b>ability</b> to improve over the lifecycle of a <b>disaster</b> response effort. But what is striking, as GDIN grapples with these issues, is how difficult it is to harness all the wonderful cap<b>ability</b> of the systems that we have today in GDIN's effort to improve its <b>ability</b> to improve <b>disaster</b> response. It turns out that it is simply very difficult to share information across systems - where \"sharing\" means both the <b>ability</b> to find the right information, when it is needed, as well as the <b>ability</b> to use it across systems.<br><br>Even harder is the <b>ability</b> to use the computer networks to monitor and reflect status. Anyone that regularly uses e-mail can readily imagine how the chaotic flow of messages between the different people and organizations during a <b>disaster</b> falls far short of creating the information framework that is required for an effectively coordinated response. Make no mistake about it, GDIN and its member <b>disaster</b> response organizations find computers to be very useful - but it is even more striking how the capabilities offered by today's personal productivity and publishing systems are mismatched to the needs of these organizations as they work to coordinate effective response flexibly and quickly.<br><br>\"Difficulties with knowledge governance. - As another example of our still relatively primitive <b>ability</b> to deal with information exchange among groups, consider the chaotic and increasingly frightening direction of new laws regarding knowledge governance - most notably reflected in laws regarding copyright. Because it is generally technically advanced, one might think that my country, the United States, would be representative of leading edge cap<b>ability</b> to deal with knowledge governance and knowledge sharing. But, instead, we are passing increasingly draconian laws to protect the economic value of copies of information. In the US, we are even  contemplating laws that would require hardware manufacturers to take steps to encrypt and protect copies (ref. 2)<br>We are doing this while entering a digital era in which the marginal cost of a copy is zero - at a time where the very meaning and significance of the notion of \"copy\" has changed. It is as if we are trying to erect dikes, using laws, to keep the future from flooding in..<br><br>The immediate effect of all this is to enable a dramatic shift in control to the owners of information, away from the users of information (ref. 3) - a strategy which will almost certainly fail in  the long run and that has confusing and probably damaging economic consequences in the short run.<br><br>The most modest conclusion that one might draw from watching the U.S. attempt to deal with knowledge governance in a digital age is that the legislators have a weak understanding of the issues and are responding to the enormous political power of the companies with vested interest in old ways of using information. Looking somewhat more deeply, it seems quite clear that we are ill-prepared to come to terms with an environment in which the social value of knowledge emerges from collaborative use of it. The entire idea of value emerging from sharing, collaboration, and use of knowledge - as opposed to treating knowledge as a scarce resource that should be owned and protected - is anathema to the  20th century knowledge owners, who are fighting hard to protect their turf.<br><br>STRUCTURAL ROOTS OF THE PROBLEM<br><br>One possible response to my examples is to say, \"Doug, be patient. These are new problems and hard problems and it takes time to <b>solve</b> them. We will have better tools and better laws over time. Just wait.\"<br><br>An off-handed response might be that I have been trying to be patient for <b>fifty</b> years. But a much more important, meaningful response is that patience has nothing to do with it. These problems are not due to lack of time, but are instead due to structural factors that create a systematic <b>bias</b> against the <b>improvement</b> of what I call \"Collective IQ.\"<br><br>The good news is that, if we can see and understand the <b>bias</b>, we have the opportunity to change it. If we can see how some of the basic assumptions that we bring to the development of computing technologies lead us away from <b>improvement</b> in our <b>ability</b> to <b>solve</b> problems collectively, we can reexamine those assumptions and chart a different course.<br><br>>Oxymoron: \"Market Intelligence\" - One of the strongly held beliefs within the United States is that the best way to choose between competing technologies and options for <b>investment</b> is to \"let the <b>market</b> decide.\" In my country we share a mystical, almost religious kind of faith in the efficacy of this approach, growing from Adam Smith's idea of an \"invisible hand\" controlling <b>market</b>s and turning selfish interest into general good. The \"<b>market</b>\" assumes the dimensions of faceless, impersonal deity, punishing economically inefficient solutions and rewarding the economically fit. We believe in the wisdom of the <b>market</b> and belief that it represents a collective intelligence that surpasses the understanding of us poor mortal players in the <b>market</b>'s great plan.<br><br>One of the nice things about getting outside the U.S. - giving a talk here, in Singapore, for example - is that it is a little easier to see what an odd belief this is. It is one of the strange quirks of the U.S. culture.<br><br>In any case, it is quite clear that whatever it is that the <b>market</b> \"knows,\" its knowledge is fundamentally conservative in that it only values what is available today. Markets are, in particular, notoriously poor judges of value for things that are not currently being bought and sold. In other words, <b>market</b>s do a bad job at assessing the value of <b>innovation</b> when that <b>innovation</b> is so new that it will actually rearrange the structure of the <b>market</b>s.<br><br>This is well understood by people doing <b>market</b> research. Decades ago, when Hewlett Packard was first coming up with the idea of a desktop laser printer - before anyone had experience with such devices and before there was even software available for desktop publishing - <b>market</b> studies of the potential use and penetration for desktop laser printing came up with a very strange answer: people simply did not yet have enough experience with the devices to be able to understand their value. The same thing happened to companies, ten to fifteen years ago, when they did <b>market</b> studies about the potential value and use of digital cameras.<br><br>Perhaps the best study of this systematic and very basic conflict between <b>market</b>s and certain kind of <b>innovation</b>s is Clayton Christensen's classic and very valuable book, The Innovator's Dilemma (ref. 4). Probably most of you are familiar with Christensen's thesis (if you haven't read the book, you should), but, briefly stated, it is that one kind of <b>innovation</b> - Christensen calls it \"continuous <b>innovation</b>\" - emerges when companies do a good job of staying close to their customers and, in general, \"listening to the <b>market</b>.\" This is the kind of <b>innovation</b> that produces better versions of the kinds of products that are already in the <b>market</b>. If we were all riding tricycles, continuous <b>innovation</b> would lead to more efficient, more comfortable, and perhaps more affordable tricycles.<br><br>But it would never, ever produce a bicycle. To do that, you need a different kind of <b>innovation</b> - one that usually, at the outset, results in products that do not make sense to the existing <b>market</b> and that it therefore cannot value. Christensen calls this \"<b>discontinuous</b> <b>innovation</b>.\"<br><br>Discontinuous <b>innovation</b> is much riskier,  in that it is much less predicable,  than continuous <b>innovation</b>. It disrupts <b>market</b>s. It threatens the positions of <b>market</b> leaders because, as leaders, they need to \"listen\" to the existing <b>market</b> and existing customers and keep building improved versions of the old technology, rather than take advantage of the new <b>innovation</b>. It is this power to create great change that makes <b>discontinuous</b> <b>innovation</b> so valuable over the long run. It is how we step outside the existing paradigm to create something that is really new.<br><br></div><div id='full_2'><mark>In the past <b>fifty</b> years of history of computing, the one really striking example of <b>discontinuous</b> <b>innovation</b> - the kind where the <b>market</b>'s \"intelligence\" approached an IQ of zero - was early generation of World Wide Web software - and in particular, the Mosaic <b>web</b> browser.</mark></div><div> There were, as the Web first emerged, numerous companies selling highly functional electronic page viewers - viewers that could jump around in electronic books, follow different kinds of hyperlinks, display vector graphics, and do many other things that early <b>web</b> browsers could not do. The companies in this early electronic publishing business were actually able to sell these \"electronic readers\" for as much as US $50 a \"seat\" - meaning that, when selling electronic document viewers to big companies with many users, this was big business.<br><br>Then, along came the Web and Mosaic - a free Web browser that was much less functional than these proprietary offers. But it was free! And, more important, it could do something else that these other viewers could not do - it provided access to information anywhere in the world on the Web. As a result, over the next few years, everything changed. We actually did get closer to the goal of computers assisting with collaborative work.<br><br>But the key point of the story is that, at first, the \"<b>market</b> intelligence\" saw no value in <b>web</b> browsers at all. In fact, the <b>market</b> leader, Microsoft, initially started off in the direction of building its own proprietary viewer and network - because that is what <b>market</b> intelligence suggested would work. Fortunately for Microsoft's shareholders, Bill Gates realized that he was facing a discontinuity, and threw the company into a sudden and aggressive campaign to change course.<br><br>Despite the Web, despite the example of Mosaic, despite all the work that Christensen has done to teach us about <b>discontinuous</b> <b>innovation</b>, most companies still act as if they believe that the <b>market</b> is intelligent - and, to be sure, this approach really does often work, in the short term. So we are saddled with a systematic, built-in <b>bias</b> against thinking outside the box. And that <b>bias</b> gets in the way of solving hard problems, such as building high performance tools that help groups of people collaborate more effectively.<br><br>In a little bit, I will explain how we can overcome such systematic <b>bias</b> and open the doors to the very substantial rewards from continued, productive <b>discontinuous</b> <b>innovation</b>. There is huge opportunity here - and it is an opportunity that will be most available to emerging economies rather than to the incumbents. But, before turning to solutions, I need to tell you about another dimension of systematic <b>bias</b> that is getting in the way of our making important progress in finding new ways to use computers.<br><br>\"The seductive, destructive appeal of \"ease of use.\" - A second powerful, systematic <b>bias</b> that leads computing technology development away from grappling with serious issues of collaboration - the kind of thing, for example, that would really make a difference to <b>disaster</b> response organizations - is the belief that \"ease of use\" is somehow equated with better products.<br>Going back to my tricycle/bicycle analogy, it is clear that for an unskilled user, the tricycle is much easier to use. But, as we know, the payoff from investing in learning to ride on two wheels is enormous.<br><br>We seem to lose sight of this very basic distinction between \"ease of use\" and \"performance\" when we evaluate computing systems. For example, just a few weeks ago, in early March, I was invited to participate in a set of discussions, held at IBM's Almaden Labs, that looked at new research and technology associated with knowledge management and retrieval. One thing that was clearly evident in these presentations was that the first source of <b>bias</b> - the tendency to look solely to the invisible hand and intelligence of the <b>market</b> for guidance, was in full gear. Most of the presenters were looking to build a better tricycle, following the <b>market</b> to the next stage of continuous <b>innovation</b>, rather than stepping outside the box to consider something really new.<br><br>But there was another <b>bias</b>, even in the more innovative work - and that <b>bias</b> had to do with deciding to set aside technology and user interactions that were \"too difficult\" for users to learn. I was particularly disappointed to learn, for example, that one of the principal <b>web</b>sites offering knowledge retrieval on the <b>web</b> had concluded that a number of potentially more powerful searching tools should not be offered because user testing discovered that they were not easy to use.<br><br>Here in Singapore, I see a lot of people wind surfing. I am sure that there are <b>beginner</b> boards and sails, just as in kayaking there are beamy, forgiving boats that are good for <b>beginner</b>s, and in tennis there are powerful racquets that make it easy for <b>beginner</b>s to wallop the ball even with a short swing. But someone who wants real performance in wind surfing, to have control in difficult conditions, does not want a beginning board. Someone who wants a responsive kayak, that will perform well in following seas and surf, does not want a <b>beginner</b>'s boat. A serious tennis player with a powerful swing does not want a <b>beginner</b>'s racquet.<br><br>Why do we assume that, in computing, ease of use - particularly ease of use by people with little training - is desirable for anyone other than a <b>beginner</b>?  Sure, I understand that the big money for a company making surfboards, tennis racquets, skis, golf clubs, and what-have-you is always in the low end of the <b>market</b>, serving the weekend amateur. And surely the same thing is true in computing. That is not surprising. What is surprising is that, in serious discussions with serious computer/human factors experts, who are presumably trying to address hard problems of knowledge use and collaboration, ease of use keeps emerging as a key design consideration.<br><br>Doesn't anyone ever aspire to serious amateur or pro status in knowledge work?<br><br>RESTORING BALANCE<br><br>I need to remind you of what I said at the beginning of this talk: we have made huge strides forward in computing. It is a wonderful thing to have a large, mass <b>market</b> for equipment that has brought the cost of computing hardware and software down to the point where truly staggering computing cap<b>ability</b> is available for a few thousand - even a few hundred - dollars. It has been a marvelous <b>fifty</b> years. But I want to alert you to two very important facts:<br><br>We are still not able to address critically important problems - particularly if those problems demand high performance <b>ability</b> to collect and share knowledge across groups of people.<br><br>This in<b>ability</b> is not an accident, but emerges from values and approaches that are \"designed into\" our approach to addressing <b>innovation</b> in computing.<br>These facts are critical for institutions and individuals who are interested in improving our <b>ability</b> to improve. I am pretty sure that this includes everyone in this audience. The important realization - and the message of this talk - is that these institutions and individuals can take big steps forward simply by systematically addressing the <b>bias</b>es that are pushing <b>innovation</b> toward lowest common denominator solutions and toward simple continuation down roads that we already understand. This does not mean that we should stop building easy to use applications that represent continuous <b>innovation</b>. What it does mean is that we also need to find ways to address the harder problems and to stimulate more <b>discontinuous</b> <b>innovation</b>.<br><br>This focus on new, <b>discontinuous</b> <b>innovation</b> is particularly important for the majority of people and nations in the world who are building emerging economies. It is the developing nations that  have the most to gain from developing new ways to share knowledge and to stimulate <b>improvement</b>.<br><br>MOVING FROM \"INVISIBLE HAND\" TO STRATEGY<br><br>The good news is that it is possible to build an <b>infrastructure</b> that supports <b>discontinuous</b> <b>innovation</b>. There is no need at all to depend on mystical, invisible hands and the oracular pronouncements hidden within the <b>market</b>place. </div><div id='full_1'><mark>The alternative is conscious <b>investment</b> in an <b>improvement</b> <b>infrastructure</b> to support new, <b>discontinuous</b> <b>innovation</b> (ref.</mark></div><div> 5).<br><br>This is something that individual organizations can do - it is also something that local governments, nations, and regional alliances of nations can do. All that is necessary is an understanding of how to structure that conscious <b>investment</b>.<br><br>\"ABCs of <b>improvement</b> <b>infrastructure</b>. - The key to developing an effective <b>improvement</b> <b>infrastructure</b> is the realization that, within any organization, there is a division of attention between the part of the organization that is concerned with the organization's primary activity - I will call this the \"A\" activity - and the part of the organization concerned with improving the cap<b>ability</b> to perform this A-level function. I refer to these <b>improvement</b> efforts as \"B\" activities. The two different levels of activity are illustrated in \".<br><br>Graphic depicting Infrastructure fundamentals: A and B Activities<br>Figure 1. Infrastructure fundamentals: A and B Activities (Engelbart, 1962, 1992)<br>The <b>investment</b> made in B activities is recaptured, along with an aggressive internal rate of return, through improved productivity in the A activity. If <b>investment</b>s in R&D, IT <b>infrastructure</b>, and other dimensions of the B activity are effective, the rate of return for a dollar invested in the B activity will be higher than for a dollar invested in the A activity.<br><br>Clearly, there are limits to how far a company can pursue an <b>investment</b> and growth strategy based on type B activities - at some point the marginal returns for new <b>investment</b> begin to fall off. This leads to a question: How can we maximize the return from <b>investment</b> in B activities, maximizing the <b>improvement</b> that they enable?<br><br>Put another way, we are asking how we improve our <b>ability</b> to improve. This question suggests that we really need to think in terms of yet another level of activity - I call it the \"C\" activity - that focuses specifically on the matter of accelerating the rate of <b>improvement</b>. Figure 2 shows what I mean.<br><br><br>Introducing 'C' level activity to improve the <b>ability</b> to improve<br>Figure 2. Introducing \"C\" level activity to improve the <b>ability</b> to improve (Engelbart, 1962)<br>Clearly, <b>investment</b> in type C activities is potentially highly leveraged. The right <b>investment</b>s here will be multiplied in returns in increased B level productivity - in the <b>ability</b> to improve - which will be multiplied again in returns in productivity in the organization's primary activity. It is a way of getting a kind of compound return on <b>investment</b> in <b>innovation</b>.<br><br>The highly leveraged nature of <b>investment</b> in type C activities make this kind of <b>investment</b> in <b>innovation</b> particularly appropriate for governments, public service institutions such as libraries, and broad consortia of different companies and agencies across an entire industry. The reason for this is not only that a small <b>investment</b> here can make a big difference - though that certainly is an important consideration - but also because the <b>investment</b> in C activities is typically pre-competitive. It is <b>investment</b> that can be shared even among competitors in an industry because it is, essentially, <b>investment</b> in creating a better playing field. Perhaps the classic recent example of such <b>investment</b> in the U.S. is the relatively small <b>investment</b> that the Department of Defense made in what eventually became the Internet.<br><br>Another example, looking to the private sector, is the <b>investment</b> that companies made in improving product and process quality as they joined in the quality movement. What was particularly important about this <b>investment</b> was that, when it came to ISO 9000 compliance and other quality programs and measures, companies - even competing companies - joined together in industry consortia to develop benchmarks and standards. They even shared knowledge about quality programs. What emerged from this collaborative activity at the C level was significant gain for individual companies at the B and A levels. When you are operating at the C level, collaboration can produce much larger returns than competition.<br><br>INVESTING WISELY IN IMPROVEMENT<br><br>Let's keep our bigger goal in mind: we want to correct the current <b>bias</b>, emerging from over-reliance on <b>market</b> forces and the related obsession with ease of use that get in the way of developing better computing tools. We want to do this so that we can use computers to augment the capabilities of entire groups of people as they share knowledge and work together on truly difficult problems. </div><div id='full_3'><mark>The proposal that I am placing on the table is to correct that <b>bias</b> by making relatively small, but highly leveraged <b>investment</b>s in efforts to improve our <b>ability</b> to improve - in what I have called type C activities.</mark></div><div><br><br></div><div id='full_0'><mark>The proposal is attractive not only for quantitative reasons - because it can produce a lot of change with a relatively small <b>investment</b> - but also for qualitative reasons:  This kind of <b>investment</b> is best able to support disruptive <b>innovation</b> - the kind of <b>innovation</b> that is necessary to embrace a new, knowledge-centered society.</mark></div><div> The acceleration in movement away from economic systems based on manufacturing and toward systems based on knowledge needs to be reflected in accelerated change in our ways of working with each other. This is the kind of change that we can embrace by focusing on type C activity and on <b>improvement</b> of our <b>ability</b> to improve.<br><br>Given all of that, what do we need to do?  If, say, Singapore wants to use this kind of <b>investment</b> as a focus for its development activity, where does it concentrate its attention?  If the organizations participating in this World Library Summit want to support and stimulate this kind of <b>investment</b>, where do they begin?<br><br>The answer to such questions has two different, but complementary dimensions. The first dimension has to do with process:  How do you operate and set expectations in a way that is consistent with productive type C activity?  The second dimension has to do with actual tools and techniques.<br><br>PROCESS CONSIDERATIONS<br><br>Making an <b>investment</b> in type C activity is not the same as investing in research into new materials or in an ERP system to provide better control over inventory and accounting. Those kinds of <b>investment</b>s have very specific objectives and tend to proceed in a straight line from specification to final delivery. Sure, we know that there are usually surprises and unplanned side trips, but that is not the initial expectation. B level <b>investment</b>s are supposed to be predictable. Nobody, for example, would think of installing two ERP systems - say, SAP and Peoplesoft - to discover which is better. In B-level <b>investment</b>, you make the design decisions up front and then implement the design.<br><br>That is not the way it works with C-level <b>investment</b>s. Here, you typically do, in fact, pursue multiple paths concurrently. At the C level we are trying to understand how <b>improvement</b> really happens, so that we can improve our <b>ability</b> to improve. This means having different groups exploring different paths to the same goal. As they explore, they constantly exchange information about what they are learning. The goal is to maximize overall progress by exchanging important information as the different groups proceed. What this means, in practice, is that the dialog between the people working toward pursuit of the goal is often just as important as the end result of the research. Often, it is what the team learns in the course of the exploration that ultimately opens up breakthrough results.<br><br>Another difference between <b>innovation</b> at the C level and <b>innovation</b> that is more focused on specific results is that, at the C level, context is tremendously important.  We are not trying to <b>solve</b> a specific problem, but, instead, are reaching for insight into a broad class of activities and opportunities for <b>improvement</b>. That means attending to external information as well as to the specifics of the particular work at hand. In fact, in my own work, I have routinely found that when I seem to reach a dead end in my pursuit of a problem, the key is usually to move up a level of abstraction, to look at the more general case.<br><br>Note that this is directly counter to the typical approach to solving focused, B-level problems, where you typically keep narrowing the problem in order to make it more tractable. In our work on improving <b>improvement</b>, the breakthroughs come from the other direction - from taking on an even bigger problem.<br><br>So, the teams working at the C-level are working in parallel, sharing information with each other, and also tying what they find to external factors and bigger problems. Put more simply, C-level work requires <b>investment</b> integration - a concerted effort to tie the pieces together.<br><br>That is, by the way, the reason that the teams that I was leading at SRI were developing ways to connect information with hyperlinks, and doing this more than two decades before it was happening on the <b>web</b>. Hyperlinks were quite literally a critical part of our <b>ability</b> to keep track of what we were doing.<br><br>Thinking back to our research at SRI leads me to another key feature of development work at the C level:  You have to apply what you discover. That is the way that you reach out and snatch a bit of the future and bring it back to the present:  You grab it and use it.<br><br>At the C-level, then, the approach focuses on:<br><br>Concurrent development<br><br>Integration across the different concurrent activities though continuous dialog and through constant cross checking with external information<br><br>Application of the knowledge that is gained, as a way of not only testing it, but also as a way to understand its nature and its <b>ability</b> to support <b>improvement</b>.<br>As a mnemonic device to help pull together these key features of the C-level process, you can take \"Concurrent Development,\" \"Integration,\" and \"Application of Knowledge\" and put them together in the term \"CoDIAK.\" For me, this invented word has become my shorthand for the most important characteristics of the C-level discovery activity. Figure 3 illustrates the way that the CoDIAK process builds on continuous, dynamic integration of information so that the members of the <b>improvement</b> team can learn from each other and move forward.<br><br>Graphic depicting Key elements of the CoDIAK process<br>Figure 3. </div><div id='full_4'><mark>Key elements of the CoDIAK process (Engelbart, 1992)<br><br>INVESTMENT IN TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES<br><br>Returning once again to the main theme of this talk, my goal is to help the people at this World Library Summit see how they, through their governments and institutions, can make a highly leveraged <b>investment</b> in a different kind of <b>innovation</b>, one that will open up new opportunities and capabilities in computing.</mark></div><div> Part of what is needed is a new approach to the process of <b>innovation</b> - that is what CoDIAK is all about. But pursuit of CoDIAK requires, in itself, some technical <b>infrastructure</b>  to support the concurrent development and continual integration of dialog, external information, and new knowledge. If this sounds somewhat recursive to you, like the snake renewing itself by swallowing its own tail, be assured that the recursion is not an accident. As I just said, one of the key principles in CoDIAK is the application and use of what you learn. That recursive, reflective application gets going right at the outset. So, what do we need to get started?<br><br>One of the most important things that we need is a place to keep and share the information that we collect - the dialog, the external information, the things that we learn. I call this the \"Dynamic Knowledge Repository,\" or DKR. It is more than a database, and more than a simple collection of Internet <b>web</b> sites. It doesn't have to be all in one place - it can certainly be distributed across the different people and organizations that are collaborating on improving <b>improvement</b> - but it does need to be accessible to everyone - for reading, for writing, and for making new connections.<br><br>The DKR is a wonderful example of the kind of <b>investment</b> that you can start making at the C level, with modest means, that will pay dividends back as it moves up the line to the B and the A levels. This is exactly what I mean when I talk about \"bootstrapping.\" It is a very American term - the image is of someone able to perform the wonderful, impossible trick of pulling himself up by pulling up on his own bootstraps - but the idea is one that we put into practice every time that we \"boot up\" a computer. A small bit of code in a permanent read only memory knows how to go out to the disk to get more instructions, that in turn know how do to even more things, such as getting even more instructions. Eventually, this process of using successive steps to lead to ever bigger steps, building on each other, get the whole machine up and running. You start small, and keep leveraging what you know at each stage to <b>solve</b> a bigger and bigger problem.<br><br>This is precisely the kind of outcome that can come from <b>investment</b> in building a DKR at the C level. What you learn there can be used to improve work at the C level, which in turn improves <b>ability</b> at the B level, which then translates into new cap<b>ability</b> at the primary, A level of the organization.<br><br>Another key, early <b>investment</b> is in the development of tools to provide access to the knowledge in the DKR for all classes of users, from <b>beginner</b>s to professional knowledge workers expecting high performance. This \"hyperscope\" - that is my term for it - allows everyone to contribute and use the information in the DKR according to his or her <b>ability</b>. It avoids the problem of making everyone, even the pros, play with the same, over-powered tennis racquets that are helpful for <b>beginner</b>s.<br><br>Tied to the hyperscope is the <b>ability</b> to provide different views of the knowledge in the DKR - and I do mean \"views\" - stressing the \"visual\" sense of the term. Moving away from words on a page, we need to be able to analyze an argument - or the results of a meeting - visually. We need to move beyond understanding the computer as some kind of fancy printing machine and begin to use it to analyze and manipulate the symbolic content of our work, extending our own capabilities. We already do this in specialized cases; one of the most spectacular recent examples was the use of high-performance computing in the analysis of the sequences that make up the human genome. Now we need to extend that to the more general class of problems that groups of people encounter as they work together, try to understand each other, and reach collaboratively for decisions.<br><br>Another critical focus area for tool and technology development centers on the way that humans interacts with computers. We have come far since the early 1950s, when my colleagues felt that such interaction was not worth thinking about. And, as most of you know, it was in the course of trying to broaden the bandwidth of the connection between humans and computers, incorporating both visual and motor skill dimensions, that I developed my most famous invention, the computer \"mouse.\"<br><br>There is so much more to be done here - I feel that we have just scratched the surface. Figure 4 provides you with an overview of this very fertile field and opportunity for breakthrough <b>innovation</b>.<br><br>Graphic depicting Key elements of the CoDIAK process<br><br>Figure 4. The Human-Augmentation System Interface (Engelbart, 1962, 1992)<br>The Cap<b>ability</b> Infrastructure - which is the thing in the middle of this picture and is what we are talking about improving when we are working at the C level of <b>innovation</b> - combines inputs from both the tool system and the human system. The tool system - that's the contribution from the computer, provides access to different media, gives us different ways to portray information, and so on. The human system brings its rich store of paradigms, information captured in customs, and so on. The more static parts of this collection can be added directly into the Cap<b>ability</b> Infrastructure through construction of ontologies and other artifacts.<br><br>The human system, as the part of this framework that is best at learning, also brings the opportunity to develop new skills, benefit from training, and to assimilate and create new knowledge. These dynamic elements are the \"magic dust\" that makes the whole system capable of <b>innovation</b> and of solving complex problems. These are what make an \"augmentation  system\" different than a mere automation system.<br><br>These valuable, dynamic, human inputs must of course come into the system through the human's motor and perceptual capabilities. It is the boundary between these human capabilities and the rest of the <b>infrastructure</b> - represented by the heavy, broken line in this figure and labeled \"H-AS Interface\" - that, in a very real sense, defines the scope of the capabilities of this augmentation system. If this interface is low-bandwidth and able to pass only a small amount of what the human knows and can do - and what the machine can portray - then the entire system tends to be more \"automation\" than \"augmentation,\" since the computer and the human are being kept apart by this low-fidelity, limited interface.<br><br>If, on the other hand, this interface can operate at high speed and capture great nuance - perhaps even extending to changes in facial expression, heart rate, or fine motor responses, then we greatly increase the potential to integrate the human capabilities directly into the overall system, which means that we can then feed them back, amplify them, and use them.<br><br>When you begin to conceive of the human-system interface in this way, the whole notion of \"ease of use\" - this matter that we are now so obsessed with - appears, as it should, as merely a single and, in the grand scheme of things, not terribly important dimension within a much richer structure. The key to building a more powerful cap<b>ability</b> <b>infrastructure</b> lies in expanding the channels and modes of communication - not simplifying them.<br><br>This is very powerful, exciting stuff. If we begin to act on this notion of our relation, as humans, to these amazing machines that we have created, we really begin to open up new opportunities for growth and problem solving.<br><br>I could go on and on. And will be happy to for anyone with the patience and interest in understanding what is possible. Just call me up, arrange an audience where, working together, we can make a difference, and I will be there.<br><br>The point here, for this talk, for this audience, is that the commitment to the CoDIAK process leads to very specific directions for <b>investment</b>s in technology development - the kinds of <b>investment</b>s that your companies, agencies, institutions, and governments can make. And the reason for making them is to open the doors to new kinds of <b>innovation</b> - giving you the power to address much harder, but potentially much richer kinds of problems.<br><br>YOUR INVOLVEMENT MATTERS<br><br>Well, we are reaching the point in this talk where I should soon be thanking you for your attention and asking whether you have any questions. But, before I go there, I want to tell you again why this matters so much, with the hope of securing your commitment to help in moving us out of the dangerous, disappointing, narrow path that we seem to be stuck with following.<br><br>The feature of humans that makes us most human - that most clearly differentiates us from every other life form on Earth - is not our opposable thumb, and not even our use of tools. It is our <b>ability</b> to create and use symbols. The <b>ability</b> to look at the world, turn what we see into abstractions, and to then operate on those abstractions, rather than on the physical world itself, is an utterly astounding, beautiful thing, just taken all by itself. We manifest this <b>ability</b> to work with symbols in wonderful, beautiful ways, through music, through art, through our buildings and through our language - but the fundamental act of symbol making and symbol using is beautiful in itself.<br><br>Consider, as a simple, but very powerful example, our invention of the negative - our <b>ability</b> to deal with what something is not, just as easily as we deal with what it is. There is no \"not,\" no negative, in nature, outside of the human mind. But we invented it, we use it daily, and divide up the world with it. It is an amazing creation, and one that is quintessentially human.<br><br>The thing that amazed me - even humbled me - about the digital computer when I first encountered it over <b>fifty</b> years ago - was that, in the computer, I saw that we have a tool that does not just move earth or bend steel, but we have a tool that actually can manipulate symbols and, even more importantly, portray symbols in new ways, so that we can interact with them and learn. We have a tool that radically extends our capabilities in the very area that makes us most human, and most powerful.<br><br>There is a native American myth about the coyote, a native dog of the American prairies - how the coyote incurred the wrath of the gods by bringing fire down from heaven for the use of mankind, making man more powerful than the gods ever intended. My sense is that computer science has brought us a gift of even greater power, the <b>ability</b> to amplify and extend our <b>ability</b> to manipulate symbols.<br><br>It seems to me that the established sources of power and wealth understand, in some dim way, that the new power that the computer has brought from the heavens is dangerous to the existing structure of ownership and wealth in that, like fire, it has the power to transform and to make things new.<br><br>I must say that, despite the cynicism that comes with <b>fifty</b> years of professional life as a computer scientist, inventor, and observer of the ways of power, I am absolutely stunned at the ferocious strength of the efforts of the American music industry, entertainment industry, and other established interests to resist the new <b>ability</b> that the coyote in the computer has brought from the heavens. I am even more surprised by the <b>ability</b> of these established interests to pass laws that promise punishment to those who would experiment and learn to use the new fire.<br><br>As the recipient of my country's National Medal of Technology, I am committed to raising these issues and questions within my own country, but I am also canny enough to understand that, in the short term, it is the nations with emerging economies that are most likely to understand the critical importance and enormous value in learning to use this new kind of fire.<br><br>We need to become better at being humans. Learning to use symbols and knowledge in new ways, across groups, across cultures, is a powerful, valuable, and very human goal. And it is also one that is obtainable, if we only begin to open our minds to full, complete use of computers to augment our most human of capabilities.<br><br>THE BOOTSTRAP ALLIANCE<br><br>I come to this conference representing my own small organization, the Bootstrap Alliance. We don't sell a product or anything else. But we do offer an opportunity for you to be actively engaged with other people and other institutions that are interested in understanding how to use this new fire that has been brought down from the heavens.<br><br>More specifically, the Bootstrap Alliance is an <b>improvement</b> community that is made up of other <b>improvement</b> communities - we are focused on improving the <b>ability</b> to improve, and on helping other groups that share those interests do a better job of it. We exist to help C-level organizations do a better job of being C-level organizations. Our approach to this, not surprisingly, is based on concurrent development, integration, and application of knowledge across those different pioneering communities.<br><br>If you are interested in investing in the kind of critically important, highly leveraged mechanisms for change that I talk about here - in using the fire brought down from heaven - please come up and talk to me or e-mail me at doug@bootstrap.org. We have a lot of work to do together, and no time at all to be patient.<br><br>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS<br><br>I would like to recognize the assistance I had from Bill Zoellick in preparing this paper, particularly for his contributions concerning recent copyright activity and regarding the interaction of <b>market</b>s and <b>innovation</b>.<br></div>",

This is a very serious problem; and there are <b>strategic</b> actions we can take, <b>collectively</b>.<br><br>Consider a <b>community's</b> \"Collective IQ\" to represent its capability for dealing with complex, urgent problems-i.e., to understand them adequately, to unearth the best candidate solutions, to assess resources and operational capabilities and select appropriate solution commitments, to be effective in organizing and executing the selected approach, to monitor the progress and be able to adjust rapidly and appropriately to unforeseen complications, etc.<br><br>I contend that a strategy for \"facilitating the evolution\" of our organizations' Collective IQs will be the optimum approach. Hypertext will be of basic importance, and SIGWeb ought to be a leader.<br><br>\"Collective IQ\" is a special set of collective capabilities, built upon our basic human capabilities, such as sensory, perceptual, cognitive, motor, etc. Any significant collective capability is achieved by \"augmenting\" such basic human capabilities by means of training, enculturation, etc. in operational use of: (a) appropriately coordinated systems of artifacts and tools (the \"Tool System\"); and (b) vocabulary, conventions, roles, organizational <b>structues</b>, rules of conduct, methods of cooperation and education, etc. (the \"Human System\"). Together the Tool and Human Systems comprise the \"Augmentation System.\"<br><br></div><div id='full_4'><mark>My hypothesis is that ever-more effective \"Dynamic Knowledge Repositories\" (DKRs) will be central to <b>improving</b> a <b>community's</b> Collective IQ-essentially the capability, in dealing with a complex problem, for providing the best, up-to-date understanding of the current state of both the problem and of its solution efforts.</mark></div><div> Specially trained teams will be involved for instance, to ingest the ongoing dialog, help in adapting to the relevant ontological shifts, help monitor and <b>solidify</b> the \"argument structures\" involved in seeking coherence and plausibility, etc. And also for providing correctly associated \"views\" of the knowledge structure to facilitate learning-probably different such viewing forms for different categories of <b>learners</b>.<br><br>Consider an \"Improvement Community\" (IC) as <b>collectively</b> engaged in <b>improving</b> an agreed-upon set either of individual capabilities, or of collective group capabilities-e.g. a professional society.
